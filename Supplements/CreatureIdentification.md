# Creature Identification
For PCs to know more about a creature, they must make a skill check of the type specified in the below table:

Monster Type | Skill Check
------------ | ----------------
Beasts | Wisdom (Survival)
Celestials, Elementals, Fiends, Undead | Intelligence (Religion)
Fey, Oozes, Plants | Intelligence (Nature)
Aberrations, Constructs, Dragons, Giants, Monstrosities | Intelligence (Arcana)
Humanoids | Intelligence (History)

... and the resulting roll reveals the following:

DC + CR | Knowledge
------- | ---------------------
CR + 5  | attacks, Hit Dice, speed, Armor Class
CR + 10 | abilities, bonus attacks, reactions, class (if any)
CR + 15 | traits, damage resistances, class levels (if any)
CR + 20 | damage immunities, damage vulnerabilities, condition immunities
CR + 25 | complete lore (you get the link to the creature page)

Alternatively, a player making a skill check can ask one specific, targeted (as in, can be answered definitively "yes/no" or with a numeric value or one/two-word answer) question for each "5" of the die roll, such as:

* "What is (the creature)'s strongest attack?"
* "Can (the creature) make ranged attacks?"
* "Can (the creature) be hit by ordinary non-silvered weapons?"
