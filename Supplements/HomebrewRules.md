# Homebrew Rule Ideas

## Decisiveness Bonus (DB)
A player's character receives a +1 bonus to any die roll during the round *if* they can announce their action within 3 seconds of the start of their turn.

## Bonus Action Slots
Each character has three "slots" in which they can store items that can be reached as a bonus action. Potions kept here can be quaffed as a bonus action; scrolls kept here can be pulled out and used immediately as an action (casting time pending), and so on. Includes weapons.

## The Silver Monetary Standard
Roughly, one silver is what a day's room and board in a low-quality inn goes for.

100cp = 1sp
100sp = 1gp

Any non-magical gear in the PHB is converted from gp to sp.
