## Burrow
*movement option*

A creature that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. Most forms of burrowing (such as the burrow spell) don't allow you to burrow through solid rock.

A creature's reach with melee attacks is not considered to extend into the floor, walls, ceiling, or other obstacles. Thus a creature who burrows into the ground will trigger opportunity attacks before it gains total cover from the ground.

## Tremorsense
*sense*

A creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the creature and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.
