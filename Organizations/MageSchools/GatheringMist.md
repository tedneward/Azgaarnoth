# Mage School: Gathering Mist
**Home**: [Mighal](../../Cities/Mighal.md)

**Enrollment**: ~750

**Motto**: "Shadows Fall Everywhere"

## Membership
[Raven Queen warlocks](../../Classes/Warlock/RavenQueen.md) formed the first founders of the school, but they quickly expanded their roster to include any who live within the shadows. As a result, [nethermancer wizards](../../Classes/Wizard/Nethermancy.md) are common within the school, as are [shadow monks](../../Classes/Monk/Shadow.md) and [shadow sorcerers](../../Classes/Sorcerer/Shadow.md). [Whisper College bards](../../Classes/Bard/Whispers.md) are quite at home within this crowd, and clerics of the [Twilight domain](../../Classes/Cleric/Twilight.md) will often find like-minded individuals here. Although not always able to share a great deal, [arcane trickster rogues](../../Classes/Rogue/ArcaneTrickster.md) are still welcome, and many a profitable transaction has been had between them and others within the school. [Illusionists](../../Classes/Wizard/Illusion.md) are welcomed, of course, as are [scrymancers](../../Classes/Wizard/Scrymancy.md).

[Pale masters](../../Classes/PaleMaster.md) will often be members, but their tastes tend to run slightly differently than many within the school, and they often aren't welcome at all school activities--and their companions are almost always uninvited.

## Connections
The Gathering Mist has wide connections with a number of [Rogues' Guilds](../RoguesGuilds/index.md) throughout Azgaarnoth, and more than one city finds that the local Guildmaster's hideout seems to lie within the walls of the local Gathering Mist school.
