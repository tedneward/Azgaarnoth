# Mage School: Green Star Adepts
Arcanists often use magic to create, destroy, transform,
or alter the things around them. Some wizards
even work to use magic to change themselves on a
fundamental level - to become infused with magic
itself. There exists a small cabal of wizards who are
dedicated to exploring these transformative secrets.
The Green Star of Alhazarde, as it’s referred to by those
who have studied it, fell to the ground in the first age
of the world, shattering and sending splinters all across
the world.The Green Star Adepts infuse their bodies
with the essence of this enchanted meteorite, changing
themselves to living foci to channel their magical power.

Green Star Admixture
Starting at 2nd level, your character imbibes regular
alchemical mixtures; including trace amounts of green
star metal. Your skin thickens and hardens, with tiny
shards of emerald crystals growing where calluses
and scars would mark your skin. This grants you the
following benefits:
• While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor
Class equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
• Your unarmed attacks deal 1d4 damage. This
damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th
level, and finally 1d10 at 18th level.
Star Expert
Starting at 2nd level, add your Intelligence modifier to
any ability check which involves the sky or heavens;
such as navigating by the stars, determining the time of
day, or predicting the weather. Additionally, as a bonus
action, you can make your emerald crystals glow, which
sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. You can dismiss this
effect at will.
Jade Skin
Beginning at 6th level, your body shape changes, with
hard edged planes forming across your skin. A green
hue coats your body from head to toe. This change
grants your body exceptional toughness. You can add
your Intelligence modifier to Strength and Constitution
saving throws. Whenever a critical hit is scored against
you, make a Constitution saving throw. Use the
modified attack roll total as the DC. If you succeed, the
critical hit becomes a normal hit.
Arcane Focus
Starting at 10th level, you no longer need a spellcasting
focus for any spells you cast. Your spell attacks against
creatures within melee reach deal additional damage
equal to your unarmed attacks.
Additionally, any spell you cast with a target of self
that you cast without using a higher level spell slot,
counts as though you had cast the spell using a spell slot
one level higher than the slot used. You regain the use
of this ability after finishing a short or long rest.
Emerald Perfection
Starting at 14th level, your appearance looks like a
sculpture of carved emeralds. You no longer need to eat,
drink, breathe, or sleep, and you are immune to poison
damage and disease. You do not suffer from exhaustion
and you are immune to the deafened, incapacitated,
petrified, poisoned, stunned, and unconscious
conditions.

# Green Star Unique Spells
Emerald Bands
1st-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You throw a set of glowing green bands at a Medium
or smaller target within range. The target must make an
opposed Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)
check against your spell attack roll. On a failure,
the target is grappled by you while you maintain
concentration on this spell. On each of its turns, the
target can attempt to escape the grapple by succeeding
on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check
against your original spell attack roll.

Gemstone Fission
1st-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a gemstone of at least 1gp value,
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
You convert a gemstone into a ball of energy. Before
the end of your turn, you can use your action to make a
spell attack (range of 20/60 feet). On a hit, it deals 3d6
force damage, plus an additional amount of damage
equal to the gp value of the gemstone divided by 50
(minimum of 1), to a maximum of your wizard level.

Jade Clone
4th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (jade worth at least 10 gp, which
the spell consumes)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute.
You create a clone of you made from jade, that’s
identical to you in all respects. It has your ability scores,
resistance to all damage, and Hit Points equal to your
wizard level. It possesses none of your racial or class
features - including spellcasting. Although it appears
to possess the same equipment as you, these are part
of its form. It can make unarmed attacks, dealing 1d6
bludgeoning damage.
You can use your action to issue the clone instructions
which it will follow to the best of its abilities. If you do
not give it any commands, it takes the Dodge action.
If you lose concentration of the spell, or if the clone is
reduced to zero hit points, it immediately turns to dust,
which quickly dissipates.

slot of 4th level or higher, the target gains temporary hit
points equal to twice your wizard level. If you cast this
spell with a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the target
gains temporary hit points equal to four times your
wizard level.
