# Mage School: Green Star Adepts
**Home**: [Ilhagos](../../Cities/Ilhagos.md)

**Enrollment**: ~50

**Motto**: None

When those advisors who came north to [Zhi](../../Nations/Zhi.md) found a small sliver of an immensely powerful green meteorite near the mouth of the Reri River, several of them began investigation into its arcane powers, a study that continues to this day. These magi immediately founded an encampment, which turned into a small village, then town, and now serves as the city of [Ilhagos](../../Cities/Ilhagos.md), where Green Star Adepts move freely about the countryside (and, later, the whole of the continent), seeking more of the slivers of the mysterious and powerful gem.

## Membership
Only those who are dedicated to the study of the Star are permitted membership; this limits membership only to those who have studied the [arcane tradition of the Green Star](../../Classes/Wizard/GreenStar.md), or those sorcerers been [born with the power of the Star](../../Classes/Sorcerer/GreenStar.md) flowing through their veins.

## Restricted Spells
These spells are only available to members of the school, and are never permitted to fall into the hands of non-members. Any Green Star Adept who witnesses a non-member utilizing one of these spells is under solemn oath to rectify the situation--usually by subtle means (stealing the page out of the spellbook, for example) rather than violence.
