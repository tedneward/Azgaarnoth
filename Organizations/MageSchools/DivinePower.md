## Game Notes
Members of the Divine Power school are [divinitists](../../Classes/Wizard/Divinity.md) and [theurgists](../../Classes/Wizard/Theurgy.md) alongside an equal number of clerics of the [arcane domain](../../Classes/Cleric/Arcane.md). In fact, within the school's walls are some of the deepest research and experimentation around the union of arcane and divine power found anywhere in the world, and it is rumored that these magi have unlocked the secret of "one power": casting spells across the entire spectrum, arcane or divine, regardless of the source.
