# Mage Schools

If one wishes to study magic within the world, it helps to go to where magic is taught; in the world of Azgaarnoth, that is most commonly done at one of the various Mage Schools founded throughout the world.
 
Typically, a Mage School is built around a particular concept or magic concept, such as the [White Winds](WhiteWinds.md)'s focus on general-purpose practicality, or the [Fiery Fist](FieryFist.md)'s near-exclusive dedication (some say obsession) with combat. Each school has its own entrance criteria, membership rosters, and frequently they maintain distinct spells, items, and training for their members.
 
Hundreds of mage schools of all size are present on Azgaarnoth. Currently the more widely-known include:

* [White Winds](WhiteWinds.md) (general)
* [Fiery Fist](FieryFist.md) (combat)
* [Glittering Eye](GlitteringEye.md) (illusion)
* [Gathering Mist](GatheringMist.md) (illusion)
* [Silent Tower](SilentTower.md) (divination)
* [Twilight Star](TwilightStar.md) (necromancy)
* [Blue Sky](BlueSky.md) (weather, air)
* [Night's Blessing](NightsBlessing.md) (healing, necromancy)
* [Ruby Tongue](RubyTongue.md) (fire)
* [Hewn Arch](HewnArch.md) (earth, stone, masonry)
* [Dark Cauldron](DarkCauldron.md) (alchemy)
* [Animalists](Animalists.md)
* [Four Moons](FourMoons.md)
* [Crimson Sunrise](CrimsonSunrise.md) (combat)
* [MindMage](MindMage.md) (psionics)
* [Order of the Awakened](OrderAwakened.md) (Mystic Order)
* [Order of the Immortal](OrderImmortal.md) (Mystic Order)

There are always rumors of additional schools that aren't formal or popular, such as a school dedicated to enchantment (which is feared by the common folk because of the obvious perils of abuse by said enchanters), and not all magi need join a school in order to thrive. School-affiliated magi, however, will look down on "wilders" as "uncivilized" or "uneducated", and many "wilders" in turn look upon their school-affiliated brethren as "sellouts" or "kept magi".

Many of these in turn have connections to other organizations, such as merchant guilds, mercenary companies, or the Draconic Orders.

Most mage schools have a "home" (the location of the heads of their school), particular membership conditions, and certain tendencies, as described in each school's individual entry.
