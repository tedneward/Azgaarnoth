# Mage Schools
Natural talent and a quick mind are only the bare beginning of being able to wield the arcane arts. Achieving true mastery requires personal dedication, self-discipline, rigorous training, and access to libraries full of ancient grimoires and crumbling scrolls. In
Azgaarnoth, where magic is regarded as too important—-or too dangerous--to be left in the hands of self-educated dabblers, it is taught and practiced by members of special guilds, societies, fraternal orders, and cabals, who jealously guard access to their powers and seek to control their use.

Such guilds arose for many reasons. Some exist to preserve arcane traditions and instruct new magicusers. Others organize the efforts of their members in the service of a worthy (or sometimes not so worthy) cause. A Mage School might operate openly (most do) or exist as a hidden society. Some guilds are large, formal hierarchies in which members are expected to obey the orders of their superiors, while others are small fellowships in which no one member is considered superior to his or her fellows. In all cases, part of their purpose is to pool their resources to more quickly advance in eldritch knowledge and might. Spell-dueling is an important tradition in such guilds, and members become experts in fighting other magic-users.

When guilds have hierarchies, adepts of greater seniority and status often have the authority to assign missions to lesser members and review their activities. 

Mage Schools usually divide the world into members and non-members; members have access to all the resources and tools owned by the School (although not always for free), whereas non-members are simply servants or, worse, petitioners. Members are often of any spellcasting class; not only wizards and sorcerers, but warlocks, bards, clerics, druids, even the traditionally "martial" classes that have spellcasting abilities are often welcome. They may not be treated exactly equivalently within the school--this depends on the mission and values of the school--but typically if an individual can touch the Weave, they can find entry within a school.

When members reach higher levels in their class, they may become a high-ranking master. Depending on the school and your campaign (and subject to the DM’s discretion), a member can usually speak for their order, with the implicit promise that the School will back the member to the greatest extent possible. These members are expected to be careful about taking stands or making promises that are difficult for their guild to support, but fellow members will generally trust each other to know when difficult tasks are necessary. Holding an office gives a member significant power to influence their order’s actions, but requires time and commitment. Many masters
choose to avoid these responsibilities and prefer to busy themselves with their own affairs.

Typically, a Mage School is built around a particular concept or magic concept, such as the [White Winds](WhiteWinds.md)'s focus on general-purpose practicality, or the [Fiery Fist](FieryFist.md)'s obsession with combat. Each school has its own entrance criteria, membership rosters, and frequently they maintain distinct spells, items, and training for their members.
 
Hundreds of mage schools of all size are present on Azgaarnoth. Currently the more widely-known include:

* [White Winds](WhiteWinds.md): generalists and arcanists
* [Fiery Fist](FieryFist.md): combat
* [Crimson Sunrise](CrimsonSunrise.md): combat
* [Glittering Eye](GlitteringEye.md): illusion
* [MindMage](MindMage.md): psionics
* [Heavens' Gate](HeavensGate.md): astromancy
* [High Tower](HighTower.md): abjuration
* [Silent Tower](SilentTower.md): divination and scrymancy
* [Collared Fiend](CollaredFiend.md): summoning
* [Shining Door](ShiningDoor.md): teleportation
* [Five Elements](FiveElements.md): earth/air/fire/water/void
* [Green Star Adepts](GreenStar.md): a mage school around a particular mystical stone
* [Four Moons](FourMoons.md): lunar magic
* [Night's Blessing](NightsBlessing.md)
* [Spinning Hands](SpinningHands.md)
* [Twilight Star](TwilightStar.md)
* [Gathering Mist](GatheringMist.md)
* [Blue Sky](BlueSky.md) (weather, air)
* [Ruby Tongue](RubyTongue.md) (fire)
* [Hewn Arch](HewnArch.md) (earth, stone, masonry)
* [Dark Cauldron](DarkCauldron.md) (alchemy)
* [Animalists](Animalists.md)
* [Symbarchs](Symbarchs.md)

Many of these schools have explicit connections to other organizations, such as merchant guilds, mercenary companies, or the Draconic Orders. More frequently, a mage school will hire a mercenary company for a variety of tasks (including escort and guard duties), engage in trade with merchant guilds, and consult (or be consulted) with the Draconic Orders, particularly the [Brass](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Brass.md)

Most mage schools have a "home" (the location of the heads of their school), particular membership conditions, and certain tendencies, as described in each school's individual entry. The "enrollment" lists only the number of actual spellcasters, and does not include any sort of guards, support staff, or extended agent networks (if applicable).

## "Wilders"
There are always rumors of additional schools that aren't formal or popular, such as a school dedicated to enchantment (which is feared by the common folk because of the obvious perils of abuse by said enchanters), and not all magi need join a school in order to thrive. School-affiliated magi, however, will look down on "wilders" as "uncivilized" or "uneducated", and many "wilders" in turn look upon their school-affiliated brethren as "sellouts" or "kept magi". These "wilders" will often be of the [Hedge Magi](/Classes/Wizard/HedgeMagi.md) arcane tradition.

## The Mystics of Zhi
[Mystics](/Classes/Mystic.md) are a group of casters who specialize in powers of the mind (psionics) rather than of the arcane or the divine. Although some of the skills taught by the mystics are found in the West (such as membership found in the [MindMage](MindMage.md) school), the Council of Seers has made a much deeper and more extensive study of the psionic arts than anything found elsewhere. Mystics can certainly be found all over Azgaarnoth, and generally they are not part of any school (although some have joined the [MindMage](MindMage.md) school out of curiosity). Mysticism in Zhi is a high calling, however, perhaps even higher than that of the arcane or the divine, and this has caused no small amount of friction between the mage school nations and the nations of [Yithia](/Geography/Yithia.md).
