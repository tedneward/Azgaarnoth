# Mage School: Spinning Hands
**Home**: [Mighal](../../Cities/Mighal.md)

**Enrollment**: ~150

**Motto**: "Who Says You Can't Go Back?"

The Spinning Hands school, one of the most recent to emerge from the magical melting pot that is [Mighal](/Cities/Mighal.md), is a school dedicated to the fabric of space-time itself, with more emphasis on the latter half of that statement. Thought to be something of an offshot of the [Shining Door](ShiningDoor.md) school, they developed [their own arcane tradition](../../Classes/Wizard/Jaunter.md), and members of this school seem quite intrigued with the idea of playing with time--if not going back into it, then bringing things forth from it. Naturally, some other schools are quite aghast at the potential chaos this school could create if they deepen their knowledge too far, but no school is quite sure what to do about it.
