# Mage School: MindMage
**Home**: [Mighal](/Cities/Mighal.md)

**Enrollment**: ~1,000

**Motto**: "What Lies Within, Projected Without"

This school is one of the most difficult to enter, remain, or thrive, as this school focuses not on arcane traditions, but on psionic traditions. They keep careful distance from the other mage schools, and any who wish to leave the school after being admitted undergo careful psionic surgery to edit their memories of their time within the school. Any who are of the school have loyalty to the school itself at the forefront of their subsequent decision-making.

That said, the power of psionics has long been active throughout the world, and despite the fact that the MindMagi have tried valiantly to gather all psionically-active individuals under their roof, far more psionically-active individuals are out in the world than are a part of this school.

## Membership
The school attracts any and all who find their powers rooted in psionics, the power of the mind. Most obviously, wizards of the [Psionic](/Classes/Wizard/Psionics.md) arcane tradition and [Psionic Soul](/Classes/Sorcerer/PsionicSoul.md) sorcerers are most at home here, but the school has plenty of room for [psi knights](/Classes/Fighter/PsiKnight.md) fighters, [soulknife rogues](/Classes/Rogue/Soulknife.md) and [soulknife monks](/Classes/Monk/SoulKnife.md).

One of the most common ways to encounter a MindMage, in fact, is in pairs--frequently a psionic caster (wizard or sorcerer) will pair with a psionic warrior (psi knight or soulknife rogue or monk) to journey through the world on various school-related missions. The two almost always have a deep [telepathic bond](/Classes/Feats.md#telepathic-bond), and are terrifying to face in combat.

The MindMage school has also developed its own unique arcane tradition, the Mentalist (below). Most mentalists are members of MindMage, and the school jealously guards the arcane tradition skillset. That said, several mentalists have "defected" to the Council of Seers in [Zhi](/Nations/Zhi.md), though it is not clear if they are teaching the skills of Mentalism to others.

# Arcane Tradition: Mentalism
Wizards who practiced in the way of the mentalist tradition, have spent their life studying the workings of the mind, and the magic that affects it. The mentalist's puissance allows them to shake the confidence of their foes as well as attack their psyche directly, in a potent combination that only the most resilient minds can withstand.

## Whisper Magic
At 2nd level, any spell that deals psychic damage is added to your spell list, and the gold and time you must spend to copy a spell that deals psychic damage into your spellbook is halved. Additionally, you know the [vicious mockery]() cantrip.

## Tendrils of Doubt
Starting at 2nd level, youâ€™ve learned how to plant seeds of doubt into the minds of your enemies. When you deal psychic damage to a creature, they have disadvantage on attack rolls against you and one other creature of your choice that you can see, until the start of your next turn.

## Bond of the Mentalist
Beginning at 6th level, you can communicate telepathically with any creature within 30 feet. The creature must be able to understand a language you can speak. The range of this ability increases by 30 feet at 11th level (total of 60 feet), and again at 17th level (total
of 90 feet).

## Demoralising Onslaught
At 10th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can choose to change the damage type to psychic. You cannot use this ability again until you finish a long rest.

## Guileful Retort
Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from an enemy's attack, you can use your reaction to cast [vicious mockery]() against that creature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once) and you regain all expended uses after completing a long rest.
