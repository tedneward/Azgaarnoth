# Mage School: MindMage
**Home**: [Tanhos](../../Cities/Tanhos.md)

**Enrollment**: ~1,000

**Motto**: "What Lies Within, Projected Without"

This school is one of the most difficult to enter, remain, or thrive, as this school focuses not on arcane traditions, but on psionic traditions. They keep careful distance from the other mage schools, and any who wish to leave the school after being admitted undergo careful psionic surgery to edit their memories of their time within the school. Any who are of the school have loyalty to the school itself at the forefront of their subsequent decision-making.

That said, the power of psionics has long been active throughout the world, and despite the fact that the MindMagi have tried valiantly to gather all psionically-active individuals under their roof, far more psionically-active individuals are out in the world than are a part of this school.

(The school maintains a large tower in [Mighal](../../Cities/Mighal.md), but the actual home is in [Tanhos](../../Cities/Tanhos.md), in Zhi. Those who know this secret wonder at the actual aims and goals of the school.)

## Membership
The school attracts any and all who find their powers rooted in psionics, the power of the mind. Most obviously, wizards of the [Psionic](../../Classes/Wizard/Psionics.md) or [Mentalist](../../Classes/Wizard/Mentalism.md) arcane tradition, [Mystics](../../Classes/Mystic/index.md), and [Psionic Soul](../../Classes/Sorcerer/PsionicSoul.md) sorcerers are most at home here, but the school has plenty of room for [psi knights](../../Classes/Fighter/PsiKnight.md) fighters, [soulknife rogues](../../Classes/Rogue/Soulknife.md) and [soulknife monks](../../Classes/Monk/SoulKnife.md).

One of the most common ways to encounter a MindMage is in pairs--frequently a psionic caster (wizard or sorcerer) will pair with a psionic warrior (psi knight or soulknife rogue or monk) to journey through the world on various school-related missions. The two almost always have a deep [telepathic bond](../../Classes/Feats.md#telepathic-bond), and are terrifying to face in combat.
