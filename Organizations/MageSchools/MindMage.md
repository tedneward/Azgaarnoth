# Mage School: MindMage
Home: [Mighal](/Cities/Mighal.md)

This school is one of the most difficult to enter, remain, or thrive, as this school focuses not on arcane traditions, but on psionic traditions. They keep careful distance from the other mage schools, and any who wish to leave the school after being admitted undergo careful psionic surgery to edit their memories of their time within the school. Any who are of the school have loyalty to the school itself at the forefront of their subsequent decision-making.
