# Mage School: Hewn Arch 
**Home**: [Mighal](../../Cities/Mighal.md)

**Enrollment**: ~1,250

**Motto**: "Upon This Rock We Build"

The Hewn Arch is a school that focuses on the power of the earth, stone, and buildings. Formed by dwarven magi eons ago, this school has remained steadfast in its study of the earth ever since. Today, members are often hired or retained by [merchant guilds](../MerchantGuilds/index.md) or [Great Houses](../Houses/index.md) to assist with construction projects, with [mercenary companies](../MercCompanies/index.md) to help create fortifications while on the march, or often [religious groups](../../Religions/index.md) who seek the construction of a new temple to their deity or deities.

History tells that the school was first founded by a circle of dwarven magi who sought to master powers of earth and stone shortly after the [Exodus](../../History/index.md), to help prepare for the eventual retaking of the [Seventeen](../../Geography/SeventeenCities.md). For this reason, many dwarves and gnomes find the Hewn Arch a comfortable school of magic to which to belong, and many Hewn Arch members have, in the past, left their offices and towers as part of the (many) Returns.
