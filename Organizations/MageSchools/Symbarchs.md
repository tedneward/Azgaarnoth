# Mage School: Symbarchs
A cult dedicated to an ancient Eldar, known only as the Symm'b'ar.

Though she vanished in the Era of Upheaval and her
rule ended decades ago, in the Forgotten Realms,
no mage in living memory retains so fearsome a
reputation as the sorcerer and wizard called the Simbul.
Considered by many the greatest spellcaster of her era,
the awesomely powerful Witch-Queen of Aglarond
took on many apprentices and schooled them in her
secrets of power, much as she herself had learned
under Elminster and the Witches of Rashemen. The
Simbul embellished traditional techniques of wizardry
with new inventions, always teaching innovation and
unpredictability. Her apprentices took on apprentices
of their own, who in turn kept her lessons alive by
teaching others.
Students such as yourself, who have inherited the
Simbul’s teachings, are known as simbarchs.
Since the Witch-Queen vanished, many of these elite
spellcasters have come together to rule Aglarond as the
Simbarch Council, made up of the Simbul’s magical
“descendants.” Other simbarchs are not members of
the council and prefer to practice their magic privately.
You fall into the latter group. As a simbarch, you
have the right to claim a seat on the council, but doing
so entails burdensome responsibilities and political
considerations. If and when you do decide to join the
council, it might take months or even years before you
are formally recognized.
Whether or not you join the leaders of Aglarond,
you wield your magic with a wild abandon that
terrifies your enemies. Your arcane power sustains and
strengthens you, granting you seemingly superhuman
reserves of vitality and health. Like the Simbul herself,
you practice compassion and restraint, but when the
time comes for wrath, you are a terrible enemy indeed.

Minor Synosdweomer
Beginning when you select this arcane tradition at 2nd
level, you can expend one spell slot to accelerate your
body’s natural healing powers. As a bonus action,
expend a single spell slot as if you were casting a spell,
and then spend one Hit Die. You regain hit points as
if that Hit Die had been spent during a short rest, plus
additional hit points equal to twice the level of the spell
slot used.
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again
until you finish a short or long rest.
Silver Fire
Starting at 2nd level, you can summon a jet of pure
magical power that burns through all defenses and
empowers your other spells. When you make a spell
attack roll during your turn, you can use your bonus
action to gain advantage on that spell attack. If the
attack hits, for the next minute, whenever you hit the
same target with a spell attack, you deal extra damage
to it equal to your proficiency bonus. This effect ends if
you are incapacitated, if the target is reduced to zero hit
points, or if you use this feature again.
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once),
regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Spell Matrix
At 6th level, you can prepare a magical matrix from
your own life energies that allows you to partially
cast some of your spells ahead of time, then cast them
more quickly later on. As part of a ritual that takes one
hour, you create a special matrix focus, using an arcane
focus of your choice and a diamond worth 300 gp. The
diamond is consumed by the ritual, while the arcane
focus is transformed into the matrix focus. The matrix
can still be used as an arcane focus, but you also require
it to employ the other benefits of this feature.
Whenever you have a matrix focus you created on
your person, you can perform a 10-minute ritual to
choose a number of spells you know that have a casting
time of 1 action. The total number of spells chosen must
be less than or equal to your proficiency bonus. You can
then expend a number of Hit Dice equal to the number
of spells chosen, drawing on your life force to partially
cast the spells into your matrix focus.
Until the next time you finish a long rest or perform
the 10-minute ritual to choose spells for this feature,
whenever you cast one of the chosen spells and have
the matrix focus on your person, you can expend one
Hit Die to cast that spell as a bonus action, changing
its casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. When
you spend Hit Dice for this feature, you do not regain
hit points. When casting spells from your matrix, all the
normal rules for casting multiple spells in a single turn
still apply, but these spells are treated as bonus action
spells for this purpose.
Major Synosdweomer
Beginning at 10th level, you can harvest excess arcane
energy from a spell you cast and transform it into
healing magic. When you use your action to cast a spell
during your turn, you can use your bonus action to
touch a creature and heal it. Roll 1d4 for each level of
the spell you cast that turn. The total is the number of
hit points regained by the creature you touch.
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once),
regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Spellfire Tempest
Starting at 14th level, you can unleash your true arcane
wrath, taking to the sky in a blaze of blue or silver fire
that burns away your mortal frailty while pummelling
your enemies. As an action, you surround yourself with
a powerful telekinetic storm, giving yourself a flying
speed of 40 feet until the end of your next turn and
ending one effect on yourself that a greater restoration
spell could remove. When you do so, the next time you
inflict damage with a spell on one or more creatures
before the end of your next turn, you can reroll a
number of the damage dice equal to your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of 1).
Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again
until you finish a short or long rest.

# Symbarch Spells
Alamanther's Return
9th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are
targeted by a spell of 8th-level or lower or included in
such a spell’s area of effect
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M (a silver mirror worth at least
1,000 gp)
Duration: Instantaneous
You duplicate the spell of another spellcaster that
targets you or includes you in its area of effect. The
spell must be 8th level or lower and have a casting
time of 1 action. As part of the casting this spell, you
immediately cast the triggering spell as well, changing
the casting time of the duplicated spell to 1 reaction.
The spell is cast using the same level spell slot as the
triggering spell, and any metamagic options applied to
the triggering spell are applied to your spell as well.
The new spell originates from you, and any required
rolls for the second casting (such as spell attack rolls,
damage rolls, ability checks, or saving throws) are made
separately to the original triggering spell.
Laeral's Dancing Dweomer
3rd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when any
creature within range casts a spell, begins its turn, or
ends its turn
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of dust cast into the air)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create a number of false magical auras that blink
in and out of the perceptions of any creature that can
sense magic, moving from object to object as they do so.
Choose a point within range. Within a 30-foot radius
centered on that point, any saving throw made against
a divination spell is made with advantage, and the true
magical (or nonmagical) natures of creatures or objects
cannot be detected. The detect magic and identify
spells, and other effects that detect or discern magical
properties, do not yield any useful information. Spells
and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a
paladin’s Divine Sense feature or the trigger of a symbol
spell, are also ineffective within the area.
Each creature or object in the area appears magical
one moment, or nonmagical the next, and whenever a
target does have a magical aura, it appears to belong
to a different school of magic each time it is perceived.
The changing magical auras are only visible to those
who can detect magic or employ one of the other effects
described above.
No More Lies
3rd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you
make a Charisma (Intimidation) or Wisdom (Insight)
check against a creature you can see within range
Range: 30 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
You roll 1d10 and add the result to the triggering
ability check. In addition, any creature you can see
within range must make a Constitution saving throw
if it fulfills one or more of the following conditions: if
it is a creature with the shapechanger tag (such as a
doppelganger or lycanthrope), if it is concentrating on
a transmutation or illusion spell, or if it is currently the
target of a spell that has altered its form. On a failed
save, the creature instantly reverts to its normal form,
and if it is maintaining concentration on a spell, the
spell is suppressed until the end of your next turn, at
which time any suppressed spell resumes its effect,
provided that its duration has not expired.
Simbul's Spell Sequencer
7th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, M (pieces of amber worth a total of
5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: 1 year
You use several pieces of ancient amber to create a
matrix that contains spells you cast, frozen in time until
you need them. Once the matrix is created, for the next
minute, you can choose a command word and then
cast up to three spells into the matrix. All three spells
must be of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level and must have a casting
time of 1 action or 1 bonus action. After the end of that
minute, when the command word is spoken for the
fi rst time, the fi rst spell you cast into the matrix takes
effect, and you gain two legendary actions, which can
only be used at the end of a creature’s turn (including
your current turn). When you use the fi rst of these
two legendary actions, the second spell cast into the
matrix immediately takes effect, and when you use the
second legendary action, the last spell in the matrix
immediately takes effect, and the spell ends. Otherwise,
the spell ends at the end of your next turn.
Whenever a spell is unleashed from the matrix, you
immediately make all decisions for that spell (targets,
area, etc.) that you would normally make as the caster.
You can never have more than one Simbul’s spell
sequencer active at a time.
When you create the sequencer, you reduce your
maximum Hit Dice by a number equal to the total
combined levels of the spell slots used to cast the spells
you place in it. Your maximum number of Hit Dice
does not return to normal until the spell ends. Also, you
cannot regain any spell slots used to cast spells into the
matrix until the Simbul’s spell sequencer spell ends.
If the duration expires and you did not speak the
command word, or if you choose to dismiss the spell as
bonus action during your turn, the spell ends. When the
spell ends, any unused spells in the sequencer are lost.
