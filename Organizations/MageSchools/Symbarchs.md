# Mage School: Symbarchs
**Home**: [Grayhost](/Cities/Grayhost.md)

**Enrollment**: ~150

**Motto**: "Til Death Do We Defend"

Though she vanished millennia ago along with the rest of her race, the Symbarchs honor a particular ancient Eldar, known only as the Symm'b'arr. A great spellcaster, Symm'b'arr was particularly dedicated to the people of what is now [Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md), and took on numerous apprentices and schooled them in her secrets of power. She embellished on what was then traditional wizardry, creating a new arcane tradition that (despite the loss of Eldar magic) continues to this day, and stressed innovation and unpredictability. These in turn kept her lessons alive (as best they could teach them), and her teachings continue to this day.

This mage school is quite different from most, in that it is tied mostly to the defense of the people of [Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md) and their growth and expansion. A Symbarch will only leave the island for reasons directly related to the defense or growth of the people, with the exception of frequent expeditions to North Bedia to help settlers wrest civilization out of the wilderness. At times in their history, the Symbarchs have opposed Bedian nobility--the Symm'b'arr was concerned with the welfare of the people, not the rulers. For the most part, however, Bedian royalty has remained true to their charge, and work together with the Symbarchs to protect Bedians from all threats.

## Membership
The Symbarchs have their own arcane tradition (below), and many wizards follow that tradition. They welcome a wide variety of skills within their mage school, from martial to caster, so long as all are dedicated to the cause of the people of Bedia.

## Tendencies
Symbarchs wield their magic with a wild abandon that terrifies their enemies. Their arcane power sustains and strengthens them, granting them seemingly superhuman reserves of vitality and health. They practice compassion and restraint, but when the time comes for wrath, they are a terrible enemy indeed.

## Connections
Symbarchs have friendly relations with most mage schools, but carefully keep the secrets of their tradition out of the hands of anyone not dedicated to the ideals of the Symbarch.


# Arcane Tradition: Symbarch
Symbarchs are a unique tradition that is only taught to wizard members of this mage school; over the centuries, only a handful of Symbarchs have ever left the school, and usually then under amicable conditions. Any apprentices they taught the tradition to were then accepted into the school when the apprentice (inevitably) journeyed to Bedia to take up the mantle of their master.

> ### Game Notes
> Wizard members of this tradition are deeply tied into the lives and happenings in the nation of Bedia; players should expect to have strong elements of that nation and its history in their backstory, and the Symbarch mage school to figure prominently in their stories.

## Minor Synosdweomer
Beginning when you select this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you can expend one spell slot to accelerate your bodyâ€™s natural healing powers. As a bonus action, expend a single spell slot as if you were casting a spell, and then spend one Hit Die. You regain hit points as if that Hit Die had been spent during a short rest, plus additional hit points equal to twice the level of the spell slot used.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Silver Fire
Starting at 2nd level, you can summon a jet of pure magical power that burns through all defenses and empowers your other spells. When you make a spell attack roll during your turn, you can use your bonus action to gain advantage on that spell attack. If the attack hits, for the next minute, whenever you hit the same target with a spell attack, you deal extra damage to it equal to your proficiency bonus. This effect ends if you are incapacitated, if the target is reduced to zero hit points, or if you use this feature again.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Spell Matrix
At 6th level, you can prepare a magical matrix from your own life energies that allows you to partially cast some of your spells ahead of time, then cast them more quickly later on. As part of a ritual that takes one hour, you create a special matrix focus, using an arcane focus of your choice and a diamond worth 300 gp. The diamond is consumed by the ritual, while the arcane focus is transformed into the matrix focus. The matrix can still be used as an arcane focus, but you also require it to employ the other benefits of this feature.

Whenever you have a matrix focus you created on your person, you can perform a 10-minute ritual to choose a number of spells you know that have a casting time of 1 action. The total number of spells chosen must be less than or equal to your proficiency bonus. You can then expend a number of Hit Dice equal to the number of spells chosen, drawing on your life force to partially cast the spells into your matrix focus.

Until the next time you finish a long rest or perform the 10-minute ritual to choose spells for this feature, whenever you cast one of the chosen spells and have the matrix focus on your person, you can expend one Hit Die to cast that spell as a bonus action, changing its casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. When you spend Hit Dice for this feature, you do not regain hit points. When casting spells from your matrix, all the normal rules for casting multiple spells in a single turn still apply, but these spells are treated as bonus action spells for this purpose.

## Major Synosdweomer
Beginning at 10th level, you can harvest excess arcane energy from a spell you cast and transform it into healing magic. When you use your action to cast a spell during your turn, you can use your bonus action to touch a creature and heal it. Roll 1d4 for each level of the spell you cast that turn. The total is the number of hit points regained by the creature you touch. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Spellfire Tempest
Starting at 14th level, you can unleash your true arcane wrath, taking to the sky in a blaze of blue or silver fire that burns away your mortal frailty while pummelling your enemies. As an action, you surround yourself with a powerful telekinetic storm, giving yourself a flying speed of 40 feet until the end of your next turn and ending one effect on yourself that a greater restoration spell could remove. When you do so, the next time you inflict damage with a spell on one or more creatures before the end of your next turn, you can reroll a number of the damage dice equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
