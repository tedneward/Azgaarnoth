Blue Sky magi are often highly sought after by the [Merchant Guilds](../MerchantGuilds/index.md), who can always use a bit of fair weather in their mercantile shipping (those that use ships, anyway). They are also quite often welcome at any town or village, since most farmers are very glad to see someone who can bring good weather to the crops (or keep the rain at bay during harvest). Most Blue Sky magi stay for free at any inn or find their meals and drinks paid for at any tavern, if they can aid the farmers before passing on.

Blue Sky magi have great relationships with most religions, particularly the Pantheonic followers of [Ehlonna](../../Religions/Pantheon/Ehlonna.md) or [Daghda](../../Religions/Pantheon/Daghda.md).
