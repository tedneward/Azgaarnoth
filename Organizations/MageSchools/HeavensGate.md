# Mage School: Heavens' Gate
**Home**: [Dradow](../../Cities/Dradow.md)

**Enrollment**: ~150

**Motto**: "Journey Among Stars"

A splinter group of the [Four Moons](./FourMoons.md) school from several centuries ago, the Heavens' Gate school seeks to find ways to travel through the stars, not just study them. Some even claim that ships can travel from planet to planet.

## Membership
Primarily made up of [Astromancers](../../Classes/Wizard/Astromancy.md) and the occasional [Luna Mage](../../Classes/Wizard/Luna.md).

## Tendencies

## Connections

About five centuries ago, a Four Moons mage started this school, claiming she'd been among the stars, sailing great ships between planets. Several dozen Four Moons magi (along with a few other interested parties) formed the core of the school, and despite the Four Moons' repeated attempts to label the whole notion a "crackpot theory", the Heavens' Gate school continues to draw its share of interest and applicants.
