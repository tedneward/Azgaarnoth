# Mage School: Drowning Monument
**Home**: [Shiagan](../../Cities/Shiagan.md)

**Enrollment**: ~50

**Motto**: "From the seas"

The Drowning Monument school focuses on weather and sea magic. They are often sought as guides/escorts/"weather mages" for the many Guilds that operate out of Shiagan, and their magic is geared towards maritime combat. Drowning Monument magi rarely spend much time on land, and many have spent as much time under water as they do above it. The Master of the School, a recluse, is rumored to be a [tortle](../../Races/Tortles.md) of great power.

## Membership
Membership in the Drowning Monument is open to any arcane caster (bard, sorcerer, wizard) who embraces weather magic. Among wizards, [hydromancers](../../Classes/Wizard/Hydromancy.md) are welcome, as are [diviners](../../Classes/Wizard/Divination.md), [conjurers](../../Classes/Wizard/Conjuration.md), and [evokers](../../Classes/Wizard/Evocation.md). Among sorcerers, [Seacallers](../../Classes/Sorcerer/Seacaller.md) and [Storm](../../Classes/Sorcerer/Storm.md) sorcerers are particularly welcome, though most sorcerers are generally welcome, even [FireSpeakers](../../Classes/Sorcerer/FireSpeaker.md), given the need to put fires out on ships as quickly as possible. Among the bards, typically the more swashbuckling of them are drawn to the sea, so the Drowning Monument finds itself taking on the odd [Swords](../../Classes/Bard/Swords.md) and [Valor](../../Classes/Bard/Valor.md) bards.

Of the membership, most are out on contract, leaving only a small handful (5-10) to "mind the store" in Shiagan. The school's physical offices are in a small building just inside the Outer Ring Wall, in the Iron Piers district, and the Master of the School, a tortle wizard (hydromancer) 15, is sometimes spotted slipping in or out of the water from the school's seaside dock.
