# Mage School: Four Moons


# Arcane Tradition: Luna Magi
A wizard of phases and a master of radiant damage,
you use the moon as a conduit for your grasp on the
weave of magic. When the moon is at high sanction, and
thus closer to the world, your hold on the weave is at its
strongest and your power magnified. Likewise, when
the moon is at the lowest sanction of its cycle, your hold
on the weave is at its weakest and your power dulled.
Moon Mages have the opportunity to become greater
than their counterparts in other traditions, however,
they also have further to fall given the wrong time of the
lunar cycle.

Radiance of the Night
When you take this school at 2nd level, if a spell does
radiant damage, it counts as a wizard spell for you. You
also know the sacred flame cantrip which burns silver
with moonlight.
Lunar Link
Starting at 2nd level, you gain a connection with the
moon as a conduit to the magical weave. As such, when
this moon is in its either high sanction or low sanction
phases, you gain the following benefits or constraints.
See the Moon Phase table for examples of lunar cycles.
• Full Moon - You gain a +1 bonus to your
Spellcasting DC.
• New Moon - You take a -1 penalty to your
Spellcasting DC.

Moon Shadows
Beginning at the 6th level, when you are within 60 feet
of a beam of moonlight, your connection with the moon
allows you to bend this reflective shine of the moon
within a 5-foot radius for up to 1 minute, even during
the daylight hours. When using this in combination
with making a Dexterity (Stealth) check, you do so with
advantage. You can also use this ability to hide objects
smaller than 5 feet wide, or other willing creatures that
are Medium or smaller, for up to 1 minute. Any creature
searching for such a hidden object or creature while the
Moon Shadows ability is in effect must succeed on a
Wisdom (Perception) check versus your Spell save DC
to see it.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until
you have finished a short or long rest.
Lunar Retribution
Starting at 10th level, as a reaction to a melee attack
that hits you, you release a wave of lunar energies to
rebuke your attacker. When successfully hit by a melee
attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to
make Wisdom saving throw against your Spell save DC,
taking 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1)
in psychic damage on failed save, as they suffer a bout
of moon madness from the exposure. If the attack was a
critical hit, this damage is doubled.
This feature can be used a number of times equal to
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once) and you
regain all expended uses after completing a long rest.
Radiant Mastery
At 14th level, when you roll a 1 or 2 on a radiant
damage die, you can reroll the die and must use the
new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.
