# Mage School: Four Moons


# Arcane Tradition: Luna Magi
A wizard of phases and a master of radiant damage, you use the moon as a conduit for your grasp on the weave of magic. When the moon is at high sanction, and thus closer to the world, your hold on the weave is at its strongest and your power magnified. Likewise, when the moon is at the lowest sanction of its cycle, your hold on the weave is at its weakest and your power dulled.

Moon Mages have the opportunity to become greater than their counterparts in other traditions, however, they also have further to fall given the wrong time of the lunar cycle.

## Radiance of the Night
When you take this school at 2nd level, if a spell does radiant damage, it counts as a wizard spell for you. You also know the sacred flame cantrip which burns silver with moonlight.

## Lunar Link
Starting at 2nd level, you gain a connection with the moon as a conduit to the magical weave. As such, when this moon is in its either high sanction or low sanction phases, you gain the following benefits or constraints.

Day of Cycle|Moon Phase|Effect
------------|----------|------
1-4|Full Moon|+1 to Spellcasting DC
5-11|Waning Quarter Moon|No Effect
12-18|New Moon|-1 to Spellcasting DC
19-25|Waxing Quarter Moon|No Effect
26-30|Full Moon|+1 to Spellcasting DC

<< GAME NOTE: Azgaarnoth has four moons, hence the name of the school; need to tweak this. >>

## Moon Shadows
Beginning at the 6th level, when you are within 60 feet of a beam of moonlight, your connection with the moon allows you to bend this reflective shine of the moon within a 5-foot radius for up to 1 minute, even during the daylight hours. When using this in combination with making a Dexterity (Stealth) check, you do so with advantage. You can also use this ability to hide objects smaller than 5 feet wide, or other willing creatures that are Medium or smaller, for up to 1 minute. Any creature searching for such a hidden object or creature while the Moon Shadows ability is in effect must succeed on a Wisdom (Perception) check versus your Spell save DC to see it.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t do so again until you have finished a short or long rest. 

## Lunar Retribution
Starting at 10th level, as a reaction to a melee attack that hits you, you release a wave of lunar energies to rebuke your attacker. When successfully hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make Wisdom saving throw against your Spell save DC, taking 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) in psychic damage on failed save, as they suffer a bout of moon madness from the exposure. If the attack was a critical hit, this damage is doubled. 

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once) and you regain all expended uses after completing a long rest.

## Radiant Mastery
At 14th level, when you roll a 1 or 2 on a radiant damage die, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.
