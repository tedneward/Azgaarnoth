# Mage School: Four Moons
**Home**: [Mighal](../../Cities/Mighal.md)

**Enrollment**: ~750

**Motto**: "Lunae Powers All"

The [four moons of Azgaarnoth](../../Geography/Moons.md) make for a constantly-shifting tide of gravitational forces and lunar influence, and the Four Moons school has learned how to tap into that for arcane advantage.

## Membership
The Four Moons school is relatively restricted in that they accept those who understand the intrinsic power of the lunar cycle. Any [Astromancers](../../Classes/Wizard/Astromancy.md) are welcome, as are warlocks whose patron is from beyond the stars.
