# Mage School: Twilight Star
**Home**: [Swamleverc](/Cities/Swamleverc.md)

**Enrollment**: ~250

**Motto**: "In Death You Serve"

Every negative stereotype ever held about necromancers rings true for the mage school of the Twilight Star. On the tiny island off the western coast of [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md) and eastern coast of war-torn [Chidia](/Geography/Chidia.md), in the city of [Swamleverc](/Cities/Swamleverc.md), masters of the undead routinely and collectively explore the depths of necromantic powers. It's not quire sure when the school arrived on the island, having been thought to have been exterminated a millennia ago, but either the [Dread Emperor](/People/DreadEmperor.md) lacks the resources to dismantle the school, has a secret pact with them, or simply chooses not to bother. The local populace labors in quiet terror, afraid to rise up against the black-robed masters that stroll through their streets during the day (and practice unspeakable horrors at night, or so the rumors claim); the city watch investigates no missing person or murder case without checking with the masters of the Twilight Star first, and more than once a citizen has thought they recognized one of the pale figures moving around in the night. 

## Membership
Membership in the Twilight Star is open to any who would explore the powers of the undead; [necromancers](/Classes/Wizard/Necromancy.md), [pale masters](/Classes/PaleMaster.md), and some [Death domain](/Classes/Cleric/Death.md) find a welcome home here. [Long Death monks](/Classes/Monk/LongDeath.md) are often seen in their company, and many believe that there is a monastery of that tradition on the island. [Assassins](/Classes/Rogue/Assassin.md) are often employed by the school, but none have ever been accepted within its halls (unless multiclassed). Any other class is generally either encouraged to find acceptance elsewhere, or considered for experimentation.

## Tendencies
Contrary to popular belief, not all of the Twilight's Star magi are evil--some in fact see the undead as a powerful and untapped resource that deserves deeper exploration as service to the living--but those that aren't are clearly in the minority. Contrary to the canonical "insane loner" stereotype of the necromancer, however, Twilight Star magi are quite comfortable working together, seem quite sane (aside from their chosen profession, that is), and have no deep desire to conquer the world. (Most of them, anyway.) The magi of the Twilight Star understand that real power lies not in mundane conquest of land, but in the conquest of death via unlife.
