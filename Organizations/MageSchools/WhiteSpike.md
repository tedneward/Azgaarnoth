# Mage School: White Spire
**Home**: [Shavew](../../Cities/Shavew.md) (in [Dradehalia](../../Nations/Dradehalia.md))

**Enrollment**: ~1,000, mostly in Dradehalia or Chidia

**Motto**: "Freeze Them All"

The White Spire is a relatively recent entry into the field of mage schools, founded (thanks to a generous donation by the Dread Emperor) in the capital of Dradehalia and dedicated to the study of magic (particularly combat applications) of ice and snow. The founder of the White Spire is rumored to have founded the school after being forcibly expelled from the membership of the [Ruby Tongue](./RubyTongue.md) school for trying to incorporate both extremes (fire and ice) into the school's study. Ironically, where the White Spire originally did seek to study and perfect both fire and ice magic, shortly after the founder's demise (and the Dread Emperor's donation), the school shifted its focus entirely to cold, ice, and snow.

## Membership
In addition to wizards and sorcerers who seek to specialize in cold-related spells, the White Spire attracts [Cold](../../Classes/Cleric/Cold.md)-domain clerics and [Circle of Frost](../../Classes/Druid/Frost.md) druids.

## Restricted Spells
Access to White Spire spells is actually very easy, comparatively speaking to other schools. Any mage that wishes to copy a White Spire spell must pay a fee (usually 150-200gp per spell level). Possession of White Spire spells by non-members is not remarkable, other than the relative rarity.
