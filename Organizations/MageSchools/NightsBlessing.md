# Mage School: Night's Blessing
**Home**: [Shincan](../../Cities/Shincan.md)

**Enrollment**: ~1,750

**Motto**: "Not Even Death"

The line between good and evil is quite a thin one when it comes to understanding the relationship between life and death, and specifically, how to bridge the gap between the two. The Night's Blessing school seeks to understand that relationship, ostensibly to allow mortals to be able to enjoy longer and healther lives, but not everybody believes that is the school's only motivation; many of the communities surrounding a Night's Blessing tower keep a wary eye on these necro-leaning magi, and periodically seek to uproot them from smaller communities when graverobbing appears to be at hand.

## Membership
This school has developed its own arcane tradition, that of [Reanimation](../../Classes/Wizard/Reanimation.md). The school also welcomes [necromancers](../../Classes/Wizard/Necromancy.md) and [pale masters](../../Classes/PaleMaster/index.md) of all elegies, as well as [Life](../../Classes/Cleric/Life.md) and [Death domain](../../Classes/Cleric/Death.md) clerics, despite the inherent animosity between those two divine groups. Most others steer clear of the school, though [monks of the Way of Mercy](../../Classes/Monk/Mercy.md) routinely check in with the Night's Blessing schools to exchange medical knowledge and discuss medicine, and frequently stay to study and treat patients together.

Despite popular opinion, most Night's Blessing magi are not evil; most are, in fact, solemnly dedicated to the extension of life. To suggest that this is true of every member of the school, however, would be patently (and repeatedly proven) false, and it is these rogues with fascination for the undead that give necromancers a bad name.

## Tendencies

## Connections
Night's Blessing magi are welcome in just about any [mercenary company](../../Organizations/MercCompanies/index.md), since mercs often find themselves in dire need of healing (and, sometimes, resurrection). Many mercs, in fact, are the first to leap to the defense of a Night's Blessing mage against mobs seeking revenge for a perceived undead attack (which often turns out to be anything but).

Night's Blessing magi have a deep abiding hatred for those that give necromancy the reputation of evil--any mage of the [Twilight Star](TwilightStar.md) is to be destroyed on sight. (The fact that Twilight Star magi often masquerade as Night's Blessing magi only deepens the depths of hatred.)
