# Mage School: Night's Blessing

This school is focused on the healing aspects of necromancy.

This school has developed its own arcane tradition, that of Reanimation (below).

# Arcane Tradition: Reanimation
You research how to reawaken dead flesh, not by
animating it with necrotic energies, but by reinfusing
the fallen with energies like those of the living.
Necromancers tend to become death’s allies or servants,
but you seek to conquer death forever with rigorous
experimentation. Students of this arcane tradition
are experts in anatomy, alchemy, and chirurgery,
approaching their work with a more scholarly and
scientific approach than most wizards employ. Most
reanimators are soon ousted by any academic institution
or arcane order once they begin their macabre projects
in this area. However, such a lack of vision on the part
of their alleged peers is seldom enough to dissuade a
reanimator. You know that one day your discoveries
could grant the option of eternal life to all mortal beings,
and those who called you mad will be exposed for the
fools they are.

Student of the Body
At 2nd level when you choose this arcane tradition,
you have made an academic study of the energies that
sustain living creatures around you. You learn the
spare the dying cantrip, and you add the false life and
find familiar spells to your spellbook. When you cast
find familiar, your familiar’s creature type changes to
construct, instead of one of the normal types for that
spell.
You also gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies
and the Medicine skill if you don't already have it.
Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check
you make related to beasts, constructs, humanoids, or
undead that uses this proficiency.
Alchemical Vitalism
At 2nd level, you can create a quick elixir that
accelerates a body’s healing powers. In order to use this
benefit, you must have alchemist’s supplies with you,
and you must have at least one vial’s worth of water. By
spending 10 minutes performing an alchemical ritual,
you can expend a spell slot to change one or two vials of
water into the same number of curative admixtures.
Unlike a potion, the admixture does not need to be
imbibed, merely inhaled or applied to the body, using
either an action or a bonus action. When a curative
admixture is used, the creature who uses it can heal
either itself or another creature within 5 feet of it, for a
number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell
slot used to create the admixture. When a creature is
healed in this way, as a reaction, it can also spend one of
its own Hit Dice to regain additional hit points.
Only two curative admixtures created using this
feature can retain their effectiveness at any one time. If
a third admixture is created, the oldest of the existing,
active admixtures is immediately transformed back into
water.
Any curative admixture you create loses its curative
powers 8 hours after being created.
Reanimated Servant
At 6th level, your research and mastery of medical
lore allows you to craft a servant from dead tissue.
The servant is a construct, much like a flesh golem,
that obeys your commands without hesitation and
functions in combat to protect you. Though magic fuels
its creation, the servant itself is not magical. You are
assumed to have been working on the servant for quite
some time, finally finishing it during a long rest after
you reach 6th level.
Select a humanoid or beast of Small, Medium, or
Large size, with a challenge rating of 2 or less (referred
to below as the base creature). The reanimated servant
uses the base creature’s game statistics, but it can
assume an appearance of your choosing, as long as its
form is appropriate for its statistics. It has the following
modifications:
• The creature’s type changes to construct.
• Its hit point maximum equals either the base
creature’s original hit points or its Constitution
modifier + your Intelligence modifier + five times
your wizard level, whichever is higher.
• It is immune to lightning and poison damage, and
to the charmed condition.
• It understands the languages you can speak when
you create it, but it cannot speak.
• It cannot cast spells.
• If you are the target of a melee attack and the
servant is within 5 feet of the attacker, you can use
your reaction to command the servant to respond,
using its own reaction to make a melee attack
against the attacker.
• It adds your proficiency bonus to all its attack
rolls, Charisma (Intimidation) checks, Strength and
Constitution checks, and Strength and Constitution
saving throws.
• Its carrying capacity (including maximum load and
maximum lift) is doubled.
• It has disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and
Charisma (Deception) checks against humanoids
and beasts.
• If it takes fi re damage, it has disadvantage on attack
rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.
• Its weapon attacks are magical for the purposes of
overcoming damage immunities and resistances.
In combat, the reanimated servant shares your
initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after
yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but
unless commanded otherwise by you, the only action it
can take on its turn is the Dodge action. If you use your
bonus action to command it, your reanimated servant
can take one of the following actions: Dash, Disengage,
Help, Hide, Search, or Use an Object.
If the servant is killed, you can return it to life by
magical means, such as with the revivify spell. In
addition, over the course of a long rest, you can repair
a slain servant if you have access to its body and your
alchemist’s supplies, and you expend a spell slot of 1st
level or higher. If you do so, at the end of the long rest,
the reanimated servant returns to life with all its hit
points restored.
At the end of a long rest, you can create a new
reanimated servant if you have your alchemist’s
supplies with you. You can only have one reanimated
servant at any given time using this feature. If you
already have a reanimated servant and create a new
one, the original reanimated servant is immediately
destroyed.
Additionally, when you gain this feature, you add the
animate dead and revivify spells to your spellbook.
Energies of Life
Beginning at 10th level, performing the ritual for your
Alchemical Vitalism feature can change up to three vials
of water into curative admixtures, and you can have
up to three curative admixtures active at once instead
of two. Additionally, a creature that regains hit points
by using one of your curative admixtures also gains
temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifi er
(minimum of 1).
While a creature still has temporary hit points gained
from this feature, it gains a bonus to melee weapon
damage rolls equal to the number of temporary hit
points it has remaining.
Additionally, when you gain this feature, you add
the modify memory and reincarnate spells to your
spellbook.
Improved Servant
At 14th level, as a ritual, you can spend 8 hours and
expend one spell slot of 6th level or higher to transform
your reanimated servant into a powerful construct akin
to a fl esh golem. The reanimated servant is transformed
in the following ways:
• Its Strength score becomes 19 if it was lower.
• Its Constitution score becomes 18 if it was lower.
• It becomes immune to any spell or effect that would
alter its form.
• It gains advantage on all saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.
• It becomes immune to the following conditions;
charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed,
petrifi ed, and poisoned.
• It becomes immune to lightning and poison
damage, and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't
adamantine.
• Whenever it is subjected to lightning damage, but
takes no damage due to its immunity, it can use its
reaction to regain a number of temporary hit points
equal to half of the lightning damage dealt.

# Reanimation Spells
Create Revenant
7th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 10 feet
Components: S, M (the corpse of a blackbird and one
black onyx stone worth 250 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours
You raise one corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid
as a revenant (MM p.259) under your temporary
influence. (The DM has game statistics for revenants).
Once raised, the revenant is friendly to you and
your companions for the duration. It obeys any verbal
commands that you issue to it (no action required by
you). The revenant is under your control for 24 hours,
after which time it stops obeying any command you
have given it.
When you cast this spell, you must choose one hostile
creature within 1 mile of you on which you wish to
seek revenge, and against whom the revenant (for the
duration), also swears vengeance. If you do not choose
a target for vengeance, the revenant ceases to be under
your control.
If you don't issue any commands to the revenant,
it attacks the subject of its sworn vengeance, moving
toward that creature if it can, and defends itself from
hostile creatures. If you cast this spell while you already
have a revenant under your control from a prior casting
of this spell, the previous spell ends and the existing
revenant leaves your service as described above.
The revenant will not seek revenge against you
for animating it with this spell. Once this spell ends,
however, if you wronged it during its life, or if you
have stirred it to vengeance against you by any of the
deeds you committed or forced it to commit during its
service to you, it may (at the DM’s discretion) make you
a target for its vengeance.
If the revenant has vengeance in its heart towards
another creature, it will seek revenge against it once
your control ends. If the revenant does not burn with
the need for vengeance, it becomes a dead corpse once
more.
Once a corpse has been the subject of this spell, it
cannot be transformed into a revenant again by this
spell for 100 years.
Dead Man's Tell
1st-level divination (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, M (one part of a criminal’s corpse,
which must be flexible in some way)
Duration: Until dispelled
You imbue a body part taken from a criminal’s corpse—
such as a hand, finger, or head—with divinatory powers
that cause it to react. Choose one of the categories of
things it can detect and react to below. When something
that falls within the chosen category or selected
subcategories comes within 30 feet of the body part that
has become the dead man’s tell item, it activates. You can
choose one of the following categories to activate the
dead man’s tell item:
• Alignment. Choose one of the following alignments:
good, evil, lawful, or chaotic. The dead man’s tell
item activates when it is within 30 feet of a creature
that has such an alignment.
• Consecration/Desecration. The dead man’s tell item
activates when it is within 30 feet of a place or object
that has been magically consecrated or desecrated
(as with the hallow spell).
• Creature. Select one or more types of creatures
from the following list: aberrations, beasts,
constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants,
monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. You can
also choose one or more races of humanoids (such
as humans or goblins). You can choose as many or
as few of these types as you like. The dead man’s
tell item activates when it is within 30 feet of one of
the chosen creature types.
• Disease. The dead man’s tell item activates when it
is within 30 feet of an object or creature that carries
a disease with which it can infect other creatures.
• Magic. Choose magic items, spell casting, scrying
attempts, or general magical effects. The dead man’s
tell item activates when it is within 30 feet of one of
the chosen effects.
• Poison. The dead man’s tell item activates when it is
within 30 feet of poison or poisonous creatures,
• Secret Door. The dead man’s tell item activates
when it is within 30 feet of a secret door.
• Trap. The dead man’s tell item activates when it is
within 30 feet of a hidden trap or disguised pit or
snare.
The first time the dead man’s tell item detects one
or more of the chosen category or subcategories of
subjects within 30 feet, it activates. When activated, the
item violently spasms for one round; a hand clenches, a
finger jerks, jaws chatter, and the like. The dead man’s
tell item does not indicate the power or location of the
subject it has detected, merely its presence within 30
feet at the time of its activation. After being activated,
the spell ends, and the body part rapidly decays and
desiccates, unable to be used for this spell again.
A creature is not detected by the dead man’s tell item
if it is separated from it by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
or dirt, or if it is protected by an effect that prevents
divination (such as a nondetection spell).
The same spellcaster cannot have multiple dead man’s
tell items affected with this spell at once. When you cast
the dead man’s tell spell again, any previous casting of
this spell ends immediately.
Lifetap
2nd-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S, M (two identical needles)
Duration: Instantaneous
You launch magical darts at two creatures within
range, one an ally and one an adversary, with the
darts transferring life force from your foe to your ally
in a golden fl ash. Make a ranged spell attack against a
target within range. On a hit, the target takes necrotic
damage equal to 2d10 plus your Spellcasting modifi er,
and a conscious ally of your choice within range gains
temporary hit points equal to the damage infl icted.
If the attack misses, a conscious ally of your choice
within range gains temporary hit points equal to your
spellcasting modifi er (minimum 1).
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the necrotic damage
increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
Reaver's Touch
Necromancy cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
The touch of your hand drains a target’s life energy,
allowing you to sacrifi ce animals, or sometimes other
creatures, to make their vitality your own. Make a melee
spell attack against a conscious living creature within
range. You have advantage if the target is a beast. On a
hit, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage, and you gain
temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt
(rounded up).
The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach
5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
