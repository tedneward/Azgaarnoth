# Mage School: Glittering Eye
The Glittering Eye school is focused on misdirection, illusion, and the presentation of things that aren't as they really are... or masking reality in favor of a different reality. Who's to say what's real, what's not real, and what's the product of hard work?
 
Glittering Eye members are often as flamboyant as they are secretive--the less the world knows about the true goings-on inside the school, the better, for all the better to confuse the world when nobody knows what the truth really is. Since illusion can also be woven with more than just magic, or put another way, the belief in the magic can be enhanced through the use of mundane means, Glittering Eye members often include those that aren't magical at all--psionicists often find a home here, as do straight charlatans and disguise-forgers.
 
Members of the Glittering Eye are often retained as entertainers to courts (for fireworks displays, for example), and individuals will often sell their services to drama troupes and theater houses. On the seedier side of things, Glittering Eye magi are often retained by those in the shadowy edges of society, by those who seek to hide their appearance, take on new identities, or even just retain a trick up their sleeves in the event they need to disappear entirely.
