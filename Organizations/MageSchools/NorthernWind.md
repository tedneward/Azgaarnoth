# School of the Northern Wind
**Home**: [Shadepond](/Cities/Shadepond.md)

**Enrollment**: ~50

**Motto**: "Eyes to the North"

The magi of the Northern Wind are... complicated. Abstract. "Eyes to the north", their motto, refers to the great expanse of the unknown that lies to the north of Azgaarnoth, and the great mysteries that await there. A school founded on the idea that magic used to be a mysterious force until a dedicated group of scholars and creatives (the ancient founders of the school, of course) managed to unlock the secrets of magic through careful study, great perseverence, and bold experiments.

The Northern Wind magi are scholars and magicians first, and rarely venture out of their offices or towers except under truly exceptional circumstances. They make great use of divination magic to scry and study from afar, or send agents to explore and report on their behalf. Even then, much of their time is spent in debate, discussion, and careful research--and in this, they are great purveyors of the large amounts of knowledge embodied in the Great Library of the [Order of the Brass Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Brass.md). Much of the travel done by Northern Wind magi is, in fact, to [Flakew](/Cities/Flakew.md) in sabbatical to study at the Library.

Northern Wind magi have a few practitioners scattered across Liria, but only a few dozen at most.

Northern Wind magi are frequently commissioned to conduct thorough research on a subject, but only when other sources of research are too expensive; as a result, the school is somewhat shabby (by most Mage School standards).


## Game Notes
Most of the wizards of this school follow the [School of Invention](/Classes/Wizard/SchoolOfInvention); a much smaller percentage of Northern Wind magi are [diviners](/Classes/Wizard/Divination.md).
