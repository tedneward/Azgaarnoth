# Mage School: High Tower
**Home**: [Mighal](/Cities/Mighal.md)

**Enrollment**: ~250

**Motto**: "None Shall Pass"

The school of the High Tower was formed when a group of magi combined their knowledge of abjuration magics to specialize around warding and defending particular points of geography; "the best way to win a fight," they said, "was to make sure your enemy can't get to the fight." Over time, their numbers expanded, they found gainful employment with a variety of different groups seeking protections of various forms, and the school sprang into existence almost overnight. They have been a fixed staple of the socio-magical landscaape in Mighal ever since.
