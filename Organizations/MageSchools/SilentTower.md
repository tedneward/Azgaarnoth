# Mage School: Silent Tower
**Home**: [Mighal](../../Cities/Mighal.md)

**Enrollment**: ~1,500

**Motto**: "Knowledge Must Be Preserved"

The Silent Tower magi are scholars, librarians, and historians, dedicated to the preservation of magic and knowledge. They claim their School dates back to the time of the [Eldar](../../History/Eldar.md) themselves, charged by those ancient beings with the task of capturing and disseminating knowledge of all forms. They also claim that they had a hand in founding the [Great Library](../../Geography/GreatLibrary.md) of the [Brass](../MilitantOrders/DraconicOrder/Brass.md), and just about any sizable library greater than 1,000 books.

They have an open rivalry with the [Scriveners](./Scriveners.md), whom they claim were banned from the [Silent Tower](./SilentTower.md) a thousand years ago over their inethical practices of gathering information. While the Silent Tower preaches non-interference and observation, they claim the Scriveners openly seek to profit from their information and stoop to inethical methods to gather their information.
