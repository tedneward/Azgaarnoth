# Mage School: Five Elements
**Home**: [Mighal](../../Cities/Mighal.md)

**Enrollment**: ~7,500, found primarily in the north, west, and east of Azgaarnoth; Dradehalia has no formal Five Elements schools anywhere within their borders.

**Motto**: "Embrace the All"

The School of the Five Elements embraces all five of the elements that make up the firmament: air, earth, fire, water, and void. They are openly welcomed in many places within Azgaarnoth, particularly since their spells can be of direct benefit to all, from commoners to [merchant guilds](../MerchantGuilds/index.md) to [mercenary companies](../MercCompanies/index.md) to [Great Houses](../Houses/index.md) alike. Members of the Five Elements can often find work in any town or city, if they choose, and many frequently use this as a means by which to establish a school and bring greater study of the five elements to the rest of the world.

## History
"Five brothers, each of them wizards, realized in their youth that the primacy of power came from the five elements. Each chose a different element to pursue, according to their nature, but rather than journey their separate ways, they founded a school together, such that each could pursue study in their element, but never entirely isolated from the other four. This led to their motto, 'Embrace the All', wherein the five would look for ways to not only improve their elemental art, but also find ways to combine with the others' arts, to create new and unprecedented results." --from the Book of the Five, the common textbook to all Five Elements students

## Membership
Any of the arcane traditions that focus on each of the five elements ([Aeromancy](../../Classes/Wizard/Aeromancy.md), [Geomancy](../../Classes/Wizard/Geomancy.md), [Hydromancy](../../Classes/Wizard/Hydromancy.md), [Pyromancy](../../Classes/Wizard/Pyromancy.md), [Voidmancy](../../Classes/Wizard/Voidmancy.md)), the sorcerous origins of [Elemancy](../../Classes/Sorcerer/Elemancy.md), [FireSpeakers](../../Classes/Sorcerer/FireSpeaker.md), [Seacallers](../../Classes/Sorcerer/Seacaller.md), [Stoneshapers](../../Classes/Sorcerer/Stoneshaper.md), or [Storm sorcerers](../../Classes/Sorcerer/Storm.md), or even the monks of the [Four Elements](../../Classes/Monk/FourElements.md) find themselves welcome here. In short, any who feel the power of the five elements coursing through them are valued and valuable members of this school.

## Tendencies
Any that do not understand the power of the elements are to be pitied, but not bothered with.

Among themselves, the Five ELements magi have a curious (and careful) rivalry amongst themselves, whereby each considers the others rivals, but also periodic partners and allies against those outside the school (and sometimes within).
