# Mage School: Shining Door
**Home**: [Mighal](/Cities/Mighal.md)

**Enrollment**: ~250

**Motto**: "Passage Is Always There"

The Shining Door school is entirely made up of a unique arcane tradition, the Dimensionalist (below). They specialize in transportation and teleportation magic, and as such, they are really more of a merchant guild than a mage school, charging exorbitant prices to set up the rare (priceless, really) teleportation circles and dimensional doorways used across Azgaarnoth.

## Membership
Membership in the Shining Door is open to those who wish to learn Dimensionalism, [conjurers](/Classes/Wizard/Conjuration.md), and the odd sorcerer who enjoys traveling. Warlocks will often come to the school to learn how to find their Patron directly, and most leave unsatisfied on that score.

## Tendencies
Shining Door adherents rarely leave their tower in Mighal, at least not by normal methods; while their tower looks like a plain, simple, guard tower with no windows (or even murder holes), on the inside, it is a vast and wondrous collection of dimensional portals to a wide variety of other places (and, supposedly, planets and planes) all of which are accessible at the flick of a finger. It is said that anyone looking to shorten a trip anywhere in Azgaarnoth can go to the Tower of the Shining Door, describe the place desired, and step through a glowing door (hence the name) to arrive at their destination--for a price. (Return trips, of course, are up to the individuals in question.)

## Connections
All of the [Bardic Colleges](/Organizations/BardicColleges/BardicColleges.md) in Mighal have a very deep relationship with the Shining Door, and any bard in good standing with one of the Mighal Colleges can request the use of the Tower Doorways for free... in exchange for entertainment, news, rumors, information, and the periodic trip out to obtain new material components. (Many of the bards who have this connection with the Shining Door also seem to have a copy of the Dimensionalist spells in their arcane repertoire.)

# Arcane Tradition: Dimensionalism
Dimensionalists are wizards specializing in dimensional magic, manipulating the very fabric between the planes of existence. A dangerous field of study, many dimensionalists are lost to the various planes during their experimentation, but those that master manipulating the fabric of reality, are forces to be reckoned with.

## Bonus Proficiencies
Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don’t already have it, and proficiency bonus is doubled for any Intelligence check that you make in relation to the planes, or planar knowledge.

## Dimensioal Pocket
Beginning at 2nd level, you are able to alter the fabric of reality to create a small dimensional pocket that you can manipulate for storing items. The size of the area that you can create is equal to your Intelligence modifier in cubic feet. As an action, you can access your pocket dimension, regardless of your location, to store or retrieve items inside it. Only you can see into, or access, your dimensional pocket. Living creatures cannot be stored in the pocket.

## Dimensioal Tear
Starting at 6th level, you can briefly tear the fabric of reality, releasing a 15-foot cone of energy from your hands. The dimension you choose to access, determines the type of energy released; fire, cold, lightning, thunder, poison, radiant, or necrotic. All creatures in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 + your wizard level damage (of the chosen type) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You regain the use of this ability after finishing a short or long rest.

## Dimensional Slip
Starting at 10th level, you are briefly able to slip between dimensions with minimal effort. When you move, you can elect to move through the Astral Plane instead. Movement through the Astral Plane using this ability is considered difficult terrain, and you automatically end your movement back on the Material Plane. Whilst in the Astral Plane, you don’t move through solid objects, but rather you bypass their spaces – ignoring non-solid obstacles, creatures, or terrain features – and your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

## Demiplane Refuge
Starting at 14th level, using your action, you are able to generate and maintain a small demiplane, that you can access at will. The demiplane is limited to a 20-foot cube, and you control lighting, atmosphere, and gravity. You can store objects in the demiplane, and you alone can enter. You can exist on the demiplane as long as you have sufficient food and water. When you exit, you re-enter the Material Plane at the same point where you left.

# Dimensionalist Spells
The Shining Door is actually quite willing to sell copies of their unique spells to magi willing to buy them, at a hefty price. Bards from Mighal also may, at the DM's discretion, have access to these spells.
