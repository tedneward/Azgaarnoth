# Mage School: Shining Door
**Home**: [Mighal](/Cities/Mighal.md)

**Enrollment**: ~250

**Motto**: "Passage Is Always There"

The Shining Door school is entirely made up of a unique arcane tradition, the Dimensionalist (below). They specialize in transportation and teleportation magic, and as such, they are really more of a merchant guild than a mage school, charging exorbitant prices to set up the rare (priceless, really) teleportation circles and dimensional doorways used across Azgaarnoth.

## Membership
Membership in the Shining Door is open to those who wish to learn Dimensionalism, [conjurers](/Classes/Wizard/Conjuration.md), and the odd sorcerer who enjoys traveling. Warlocks will often come to the school to learn how to find their Patron directly, and most leave unsatisfied on that score.

## Tendencies
Shining Door adherents rarely leave their tower in Mighal, at least not by normal methods; while their tower looks like a plain, simple, guard tower with no windows (or even murder holes), on the inside, it is a vast and wondrous collection of dimensional portals to a wide variety of other places (and, supposedly, planets and planes) all of which are accessible at the flick of a finger. It is said that anyone looking to shorten a trip anywhere in Azgaarnoth can go to the Tower of the Shining Door, describe the place desired, and step through a glowing door (hence the name) to arrive at their destination--for a price. (Return trips, of course, are up to the individuals in question.)

## Connections
All of the [Bardic Colleges](/Organizations/BardicColleges/BardicColleges.md) in Mighal have a very deep relationship with the Shining Door, and any bard in good standing with one of the Mighal Colleges can request the use of the Tower Doorways for free... in exchange for entertainment, news, rumors, information, and the periodic trip out to obtain new material components. (Many of the bards who have this connection with the Shining Door also seem to have a copy of the Dimensionalist spells in their arcane repertoire.)

# Arcane Tradition: Dimensionalism
Dimensionalists are wizards specializing in dimensional magic, manipulating the very fabric between the planes of existence. A dangerous field of study, many dimensionalists are lost to the various planes during their experimentation, but those that master manipulating the fabric of reality, are forces to be reckoned with.

## Bonus Proficiencies
Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don’t already have it, and proficiency bonus is doubled for any Intelligence check that you make in relation to the planes, or planar knowledge.

## Dimensioal Pocket
Beginning at 2nd level, you are able to alter the fabric of reality to create a small dimensional pocket that you can manipulate for storing items. The size of the area that you can create is equal to your Intelligence modifier in cubic feet. As an action, you can access your pocket dimension, regardless of your location, to store or retrieve items inside it. Only you can see into, or access, your dimensional pocket. Living creatures cannot be stored in the pocket.

## Dimensioal Tear
Starting at 6th level, you can briefly tear the fabric of reality, releasing a 15-foot cone of energy from your hands. The dimension you choose to access, determines the type of energy released; fire, cold, lightning, thunder, poison, radiant, or necrotic. All creatures in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 + your wizard level damage (of the chosen type) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You regain the use of this ability after finishing a short or long rest.

## Dimensional Slip
Starting at 10th level, you are briefly able to slip between dimensions with minimal effort. When you move, you can elect to move through the Astral Plane instead. Movement through the Astral Plane using this ability is considered difficult terrain, and you automatically end your movement back on the Material Plane. Whilst in the Astral Plane, you don’t move through solid objects, but rather you bypass their spaces – ignoring non-solid obstacles, creatures, or terrain features – and your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

## Demiplane Refuge
Starting at 14th level, using your action, you are able to generate and maintain a small demiplane, that you can access at will. The demiplane is limited to a 20-foot cube, and you control lighting, atmosphere, and gravity. You can store objects in the demiplane, and you alone can enter. You can exist on the demiplane as long as you have sufficient food and water. When you exit, you re-enter the Material Plane at the same point where you left.

# Dimensionalist Spells
The Shining Door is actually quite willing to sell copies of their unique spells to magi willing to buy them, at a hefty price. Bards from Mighal also may, at the DM's discretion, have access to these spells.

# Arcane Tradition: Jaunter
Wizards are infamous for showing up precisely
whenever and wherever they want (generally while
claiming they were needed). This procedure, when
enacted by most conjurers of cheap spells, is less
accurate on both the ‘where’ and ‘when’ than most
wizards would like to admit. However, there are
those with exceptional talent, with incredible spatial
awareness, to which conjuration magic turns distance
into a thing of the past, and the past into a grip to hoist
themselves onto tomorrow. In short: they are wizards
with a gift for twisting time and space.

Yesterday's Preparations
Starting at 2nd level, you can reach into your own past
to grab items that you have set aside for emergencies.
As an action, you can summon a nonmagical item that
you have access to. The item must be unattended, and
something you’ve intentionally touched.
This item persists for 1 minute or until it leaves your
hand, and then immediately returns to the time and
place it was pulled from. You can use this ability a
number of times equal to your Intelligence modifi er
(minimum of once), regaining all expended uses after
completing a long rest.
Empowered Conjuration
Starting at 2nd level, when you cast a conjuration spell
and do not use a higher level spell slot to cast the spell,
the spell is cast as though you used a spell slot one level
higher than the one you used. You can use this feature
a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifi er
(minimum of once), regaining all expended uses after
completing a long rest.
Tesseract
Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you can bridge two
points in space. Choose two points within 30 feet of you.
A 5-foot square now surrounds each of these points,
which now become adjacent to each other (you choose
which sides of each square touch). Any creature, spell,
or object entering the square exits from the other square
as if the two were adjacent to each other. Creatures can
attack or cross between the points as though they were
connected. Spells and ranged attacks can be made across
these two squares. For a creature to benefi t from cover,
it must also have cover against these two points. These
points remain connected until the start of your next
turn. You can use your action each round to maintain
this effect. You can use this feature a number of times
equal to your Intelligence modifi er (minimum of once),
regaining all expended uses after completing a long rest.
Strane Eons
Starting at 10th level, you twist time and space,
rendering spells wildly unstable. As a reaction to seeing
another creature casting a spell that has a duration
other than instantaneous or concentration, you alter the
spell’s duration to require concentration. If the creature
loses concentration or casts another spell that requires
concentration, the target spell ends. You can use this
feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence
modifi er (minimum of once), regaining all expended
uses after fi nishing a long rest.
Master of Time and Space
Starting at 14th level, whenever you cast a conjuration
spell with a duration that requires concentration, if the
spell reaches its maximum duration before ending, you
regain the spell slot used to cast it. You can use this
ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence
modifi er (minimum of once), regaining all expended
uses after completing a long rest.

# Jaunter Spells
Beckon Closer
6th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You beckon a creature that you can see within range.
The target creature must succeed on a Charisma
saving throw or be teleported to another point of your
choosing within range, that is closer to you. The act of
teleporting the creature in this way causes both you and
the target to become disoriented and drop your guard,
immediately provoking opportunity attacks by hostile
creatures against you, as well as against the target
creature at its new location.

Peep-Hole
Divination cantrip
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: 5 feet
Components: S
Duration: Instantaneous
You create a tiny tunnel that allows you to see through a
wall, door, or any other surface. The maximum distance
of the tunnel equals your wizard level in feet, and the
tunnel has a diameter of 1 inch. The tunnel closes up at
the start of your next turn.
Redirect
5th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 reaction
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You cause a teleportation spell to go awry, rerouting
all targets being teleported to a new location. If a
conjuration spell is cast within range, you can choose
a new destination for the spell’s target. The new
destination must be a valid destination for the spell,
as though you had cast the original spell. The affected
spell needs to have a destination for creatures conjured,
or creatures that are otherwise relocated, by the spell
otherwise the target spell remains unaffected.
Temporal Visions
6th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a ruby gem worth at least 50 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Looking through the ruby gem, you gain a glimpse of
the future. You can see (but not hear, smell, taste, or use
any of your other senses) your current location through
the ruby, for a number of hours into the future equal to
the value of the ruby divided by 50.
The information you gain is in the form of simple
visions, so while you can understand that bugbears
might be congregating at your location, you aren’t given
specifi c information as to why they will be there.
Due to the nature of the fl ow of time, creatures
viewing their own future naturally change the outcome,
and so the caster and any other creatures near the
caster aren’t included in the visions. Casters of the spell
understand that the information is symbolic and not
literal.
Tidy
2nd-level conjuration (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 40 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
An invisible sphere with a 5-foot-radius springs into
existence at a point you choose within range. You
declare an order with which all objects in that area are
sorted. You could order things by size, cost, weight, or
any other numerical value you can think of. Any object
not currently being worn or carried fl ies around the
sphere until it settles in an orderly manner. Containers
are treated as a single object; their contents are not part
of the organization process and remain within their
container.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the sphere’s radius increases
by 5 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
