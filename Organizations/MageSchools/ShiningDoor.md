# Mage School: Shining Door
**Home**: [Mighal](../../Cities/Mighal.md)

**Enrollment**: ~250

**Motto**: "Passage Is Always There"

The Shining Door school is entirely made up of a unique arcane tradition, the Dimensionalist (below). They specialize in transportation and teleportation magic, and as such, they are really more of a merchant guild than a mage school, charging exorbitant prices to set up the rare (priceless, really) teleportation circles and dimensional doorways used across Azgaarnoth.

## Membership
Membership in the Shining Door is open to those who wish to learn [Dimensionalism](../../Classes/Wizard/Dimensionalism.md), [conjurers](../../Classes/Wizard/Conjuration.md), and the odd sorcerer who enjoys traveling. Warlocks will often come to the school to learn how to find their Patron directly, and most leave unsatisfied on that score.

## Tendencies
Shining Door adherents rarely leave their tower in Mighal, at least not by normal methods; while their tower looks like a plain, simple, guard tower with no windows (or even murder holes), on the inside, it is a vast and wondrous collection of dimensional portals to a wide variety of other places (and, supposedly, planets and planes) all of which are accessible at the flick of a finger. It is said that anyone looking to shorten a trip anywhere in Azgaarnoth can go to the Tower of the Shining Door, describe the place desired, and step through a glowing door (hence the name) to arrive at their destination--for a price. (Return trips, of course, are up to the individuals in question.)

## Connections
All of the [Bardic Colleges](../BardicColleges/index.md) in Mighal have a very deep relationship with the Shining Door, and any bard in good standing with one of the Mighal Colleges can request the use of the Tower Doorways for free... in exchange for entertainment, news, rumors, information, and the periodic trip out to obtain new material components. (Many of the bards who have this connection with the Shining Door also seem to have a copy of the Dimensionalist spells in their arcane repertoire.)
