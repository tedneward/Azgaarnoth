# The Cult of the Wyrm
The Cult of the Wyrm is the name given to the various small (10 - 50 members, max) cults that build up around the worship and veneration of a single or mated pair of chromatic dragons. While Wyrm Cults often are aware of other cultists' activities, in general the Wyrm Cults each act alone, and on the direct orders of their draconic leader, which means that while two or more chromatic dragons might work together to accomplish some specific aim or goal, long-term partnership is never a realistic option and eventually the Cults will work to betray and/or backstab the other, sometimes with draconic approval or even participation.
 
Wrym Cultists will never miss an opportunity to take a cheap shot at members of a [Draconic Order](DraconicOrder.md), particularly if they can embarrass them or outright destroy a chapterhouse or cell.

It is rumored that the [Dread Emperor](/People/DreadEmperor.md) has made contact with several cells of the Cult, and offers them sanctuary in return for favors; if this is true, it means the Emperor has taken a dangerous step, for allies of chromatic dragons are generally not long for this life... but the same can be said of the allies the Emperor if they distract him from his goals.

Cult cells have been found in all corners of Azgaarnoth, particularly anywhere remote where a young chromatic dragon might be able to grow without attracting notice. They tend to lie low, since rumors of a Cult cell has been known to draw Draconic Order expeditions from all the way across Azgaarnoth to exterminate them.

## The Cult of the Nightwyrm
A rumored sub-segment of the Wyrmcult is those that are dedicated to the raising or creation of dracoliches (draconic liches) and others like them. These groups operate very secretively, as both the Draconic Orders and the Wyrmcultists are threatened by such creatures, and will immediately move to destroy any such creature or cult cell they find.
