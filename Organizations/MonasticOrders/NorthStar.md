# Monastic Order: The Order of the North Star
A monastic order closely associated with the clergy of [Lugh](../../Religions/Pantheon/Lugh.md), the god of travelers, the monks of this Order are given to wander the roads and paths of Azgaarnoth, far and wide, rendering aid and assistance to any who seem lost, desperate, or in danger.

This Order is unusual among many monastic orders in that they often accept non-monk members as full members, so it is not uncommon to see clerics and/or paladins (typically of Lugh) journeying together. Periodically a rogue falls in with the band, particularly if the rogue is looking to just wander for a while.

## Common Disciplines
Drunken Master, Four Elements, Mercy, Open Hand, Tranquility
