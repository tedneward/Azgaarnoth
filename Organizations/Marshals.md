# Orgnization: Marshals

The Marshals are individuals that roam Yithi and Zhi (and sometimes further) offering a traveling system of justice to the outlying villages. A Marshal's visitation is often a time of quiet celebration, as long-standing civil disputes can be adjudicated, wrongs can be fixed, and pleas can be carried to the provincial capital or even the Council of Seers themselves. Marshals answer only to their own organization, which is operated directly by the Prince's Council, and act as an important check on the power that might be used for corrupt purposes by less-honorable tribal leaders. A Marshal's report is given great weight, and many a Chieftain has faced eviction or even conviction based on the word of a Marshal alone.

While Marshals answer to Sherriffs, who in turn answer to the Prince's Council, Marshals often have a great deal of independence, and are often not seen for months at a time. As a result, they are expected to exercise their own judgment in most cases, relying on precedent, loyalty to the Crown, and practicality to dispense justice. This is formalized in the Marshals' Vow, a ceremony held in 

## History
As Yithi built his nation, he realized that his dream, so hard-fought and bitterly-won, lay in risk of chieftains or warlords who might seek power in his name. Drawing some of his closest friends together, Yithi asked each for twenty names of people that could be trusted to honor and uphold the spirit of the dream, and be imbued with the authority to dispense justice--summarily in some cases--without being unduly influenced or corrupted. Close to four hundred were made the first Marshals, and Yithi specifically chose several of those close to him--who were then never given a formal place in the Council as a result--to form the rest of the organization.

By the time of Yithi's passing, Marshals had been firmly established as a force dedicated to the furtherance of Yithi's dream. Bolstered by direct access to Yithi himself in the earliest days, Marshals were credited with heading off numerous potential revolts or civil uprisings by identifying corruption among chieftains but also by clearing the roads of bandits and marauders.

Today, some several thousand Marshals roam Yithi and Zhi (and beyond), providing recourse to those that otherwise have known. Some operate alone, while others build small bands to accompany them, sometimes taking on an apprentice, who will later (if they survive) take the Marshals' Vow as well. Some Marshals remain close to urban settings, acting as an adjunct to the city watch (while keeping on eye on said authority), while others prefer the hills and grasslands and move from village to village.

## Organization

Each Marshal ostensibly reports to a Sherriff (one for each of the twenty-four tribes) who in turn reports directly to the Prince's Council, but in practice each Marshal operates independently, contacting a Sherriff only when extreme authority is required (such as investigation of a high-ranking noble or city leader) or when the Sherriff has a high-priority mission. Marshals are permitted to set their own jurisdiction, and pursue their own investigations, and while it is rare, they sometimes collaborate if their investigations and jurisdictions overlap.

Some Marshals journey outside of Yithi and Zhi, either in pursuit of criminals who have escaped Yithian Law. Some Marshals specialize in this, returning home only to find new names they must hunt. It is rumored that some Marshals are actually acting more in the guise of spies or intelligence agencies for Yithian leaders, gathering information and/or periodically removing an individual that threatens the nation.

Marshals are often quite willing to work with Rogues Guilds--both within and outside the borders of Yithia and Zhi--when access to the Guilds can help track down onerous Lawbreakers. (Most Marshals do not concern themselves with material crimes.) Some Rogues Guilds, however, are antithetical to Marshal interference, and long-standing (generational) feuds between Marshals and Rogues Guilds are not uncommon.

## Composition

Marshals may be of any class or race, though a tendency towards Hordish races and martial and roguish classes are more typical. Any Marshal has to be able to hold their own in a fight, as well as be able to conduct an investigation and/or pursue leads, so generally Marshals are well-rounded individuals with some reasonable survival skills. Arcane or divine skills are also often helpful, and as a result it is not uncommon to see Marshals multi-class to improve their chances.

Marshals are generally at least 3rd level before they are permitted to take their Marshal's Vow

## Relationships

Marshals have a distant-but-respectful relationship with the [Draconic Order](./DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md); they respect the Order's commitment to upholding law and justice, but often feel the Order does so to benefit Liria and the old Empire, rather than taking Yithian interests into account. Still, it is common to see Draconic Knight and Marshal work together for some period of time (sometimes an extended length of time) to accomplish some task, and Draconic Order chapterhouses in Yithia often have well-established relationships (and rules!) with Marshals nearby.

[Mercenary Companies](./MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md) veterans often withdraw from military service and petition to join the Marshals, though not all make it--while most have the martial skills necessary, being a Marshal is more than being able to kill someone.

Marshals will often collaborate with some of the [Mage Schools](./MageSchools/MageSchools.md), both those within Yithia and Zhi as well as those without, as part of an investigation, and several Mage Schools have taken to offering training to Marshals who wish it.
