# Great House: House Haskinar
A recent addition to the Game of Houses, House Haskinar currently consists of [Rhola Haskinar](/People/RholaHaskinar.md) and her immediate kin, having received a patent of royalty from [Kedren Jarmaath](/People/KedrenJarmaath.md) a decade ago. Haskinar has leveraged that to gain deep economic commitments from the farmers around Brinwal, and now Haskinar either owns, finances, or has alliances with virtually all of the farmers that surround the city.

Haskinar is in a bitter feud of words with [House Kaal](Kaal.md); specifically, Rhola Haskinar cannot stand [Verrasa Kaal](/People/VerrasaKaal.md) (and vice versa), and the war of words between the two frequently spills out into the streets.
