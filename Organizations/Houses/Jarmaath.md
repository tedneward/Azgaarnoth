# House Jarmaath
House Jarmaath is one of the greatest of the Great Houses of Liria, frequently installing values and honor that carry on a proud tradition of centuries. Most family members of the House are wise, intelligent, and far-thinking, and any city or Barony ruled by a Jarmaath tends to enjoy peace and prosperity. If the House has one flaw, it is a tragic one towards pride, and many a Baronial Seat has fallen away from Jarmaath because it did not secure the necessary alliances and support it needed to hold on to it.
