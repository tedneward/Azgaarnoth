# Rogues Guild: Red Rose

The Red Rose guild is one of Azgaarnoth's most powerful rogues guilds, run by an ancient and shadowy figure ([Kali Kaal](../../People/KaliKaal.md)). His aims and intentions are entirely unknown to anyone, but the guild has fingers in every illegal activity possible: illegal substances, slavery, smuggling, kidnapping, assassination, extortion, gambling, if it's in any way illegal, the Red Rose is involved in it. They've got agents in every nation, spies in every court, and a network of informants that stretch the entire length and breadth of Azgaarnoth. It is often said that if your need is strong, and your wallet is deep, the Red Rose can make the impossible possible.
