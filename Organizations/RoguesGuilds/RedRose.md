# Rogues Guild: Red Rose

The Red Rose guild is one of Azgaarnoth's most powerful rogues guilds, run by an ancient and shadowy figure ([Kali Kaal](../../People/KaliKaal.md)). His aims and intentions are entirely unknown to anyone, but the guild has fingers in every illegal activity possible: illegal substances, slavery, smuggling, kidnapping, assassination, extortion, gambling, if it's in any way illegal, the Red Rose is involved in it. They've got agents in every nation, spies in every court, and a network of informants that stretch the entire length and breadth of Azgaarnoth. It is often said that if your need is strong, and your wallet is deep, the Red Rose can make the impossible possible.

## Organization
Little to nothing is known of the organization of the guild, even to those who are members. Orders appear mysteriously, as do payments (or punishments). No member knows of a guildmaster; all members only know other members, to whom they are introduced on a mission-necessary basis.

## Recruitment
No one ever applies to be a member of the Red Rose guild--if one is recruited into the guild, a red rose appears somewhere in the recruit's vicinity (on the recruit's pillow is a popular version), and when picked up, the recruit inevitably pricks their finger on a thorn and falls into what feels like slumber, during which they are introduced to the guild by a shadowy figure and rasping voice. 

Regardless of the length of conversation, when they awake, it has been mere moments since the thornprick, as evidenced by the small drop of blood only now forming on a finger where they grasped the rose. If they agreed to join, a small dark spot appears where the blood welled, on the fingertip, and it remains there--forever--so long as they remain a member of the guild in good standing. Even in the face of *polymorph* or other spells, the tiny dark spot can be found on the closest equivalent to that finger in the new shape. If examined closely (such as under a magnifying glass), the spot is actually a miniscule "etching" of a rose.
