# Rogues Guide: Traders of the Sleepy Boat
The Traders of the Sleepy Boat Guild, named almost at a whim by a group of thieves in Overoslugry about three hundred years ago, when they set up a very quiet and slow-paced smuggler's route between that city and Tragekia. Finding business to be better than they imagined, the guild grew and established additional smuggling routes to Overoslugry (and later Ghaulanejasti) to bring exotic goods from Tragekia, Ulm, and even Dradehalia without "inconveniencing" the Yithi customs agents.

The Guild is currently mastered by [Ukrod Daythorn](../../People/UkrodDaythorn.md), a somewhat ruthless Guildmaster who masquerades as a simple farmer and village councilor living in Tiborec. His position on the island affords him a convenient location to receive some of the most dangerous contraband (if necessary) before looking to off-load it in Yithi proper, but until he achieves the office of mayor of the sleepy island village, he must still steer clear of the island authorities. 

The Sleepy Boat guild tends to smuggle narcotics, exotic arcane material components, poisons, potions, and enchantment magics.
