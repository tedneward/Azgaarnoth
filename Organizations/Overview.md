# Organizations of Azgaarnoth

## [NobleHouses](Houses/Houses.md)
Anywhere there is nobility based on familial connections, those connections will take on a degree of formality, and within Azgaarnoth these came be known as the "noble houses", or just "Houses", for short. In much of Azgaarnoth, loyalty to House trumps loyalty to nation, and is cause for some of the weakness of the national governments across the world (with notable exception of [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md), which may stem from the fact that the [Dread Emperor](/People/DreadEmperor.md) claims no noble bloodline).

## [Mage schools](MageSchools/MageSchools.md)
Many wizards, sorcerers, and other arcane users pool their talents and skills in order to maximize their studies at a collegic environment known as a mage school. These schools are often more organized than not, and most mage schools focus on a particular kind of arcana, or its application, or its expression. Hundreds of mage schools are found all over Azgaarnoth, including amongst the Hordes, and many have taken on characteristics of the land in which they are found; some of the mage schools found in [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md), for example, are spoken of only in hushed whispers and only amongst close friends.

## [Mercenary companies](MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md)
The frequent open conflict amongst the nations of Azgaarnoth, and the extensive training and logistical support required, led many individuals to create companies of mercenaries that carry out said actions on behalf of the various governments. Most companies are generally of several hundred troops in size, plus supporting elements, although some of the larger companies reach into the thousands. Most mercenaries operate according to a [Mercenary's Code](MercCompanies/Code.md) amongst themselves, and will frequently offer opposing mercenaries the benefit of the Code even against employers' orders. Mercenary companies are always looking for new recruits--regardless of skill level--and many times those seeking opportunities to create a new life have found it within the ranks of a merc company for some period of time.

## [Merchant guilds](MerchantGuilds/MerchantGuilds.md)

## [Bardic colleges](BardicColleges/BardicColleges.md)

## [Monastic orders](MonasticOrders/MonasticOrders.md)

## [Draconic Order](DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md)
The Knights of the Draconic Orders are some of the most fearsome and respected people in Azgaarnoth, and they fight to preserve civilization and its benefits for everyone in Azgaarnoth. Defined into a half-dozen separate and distinct orders, each taking after a distinct species of metallic dragon, each leverages their own skills and capabilities as part of a larger effort, and periodically work together to defeat threats to the world.

## Rogues' Guilds
With civilization comes those who prefer to find "easier" ways of making a living, and it doesn't take long before they figure out it often helps to work in tandem with others. Before long, a group of them gather, and new opportunities emerge. Some of these groups focus on providing goods and services to citizenry that lawful authorities would prefer not be sold; some of these groups look to convince citizens that payments help avoid accidents; some others still look to create those accidents to eliminate individuals who are presenting "difficulties" of one form or another. All are called Rogues' Guilds by the common populace, and while many are local to the city in which the members live, some span across provinces, nations, or even continents.

## [Dueling Colleges](DuelingColleges.md)
As wars wound down into embers rather than full-fledged bonfires, and various mercenaries sought ways to test their skills against one another without all the cost involved, a series of traditions emerged--that of the duel--wherein different parties could try their martial skills against one another. Singly, pairs, groups, and all kinds of permutations therein began to emerge, and with it a set of guidelines that formalized much of the context of the duels. Eventually these became full organizations, with standing structures, that came to be known as the "dueling colleges", and they thrive today.
