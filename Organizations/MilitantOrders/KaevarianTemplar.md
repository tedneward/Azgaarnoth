# Militant Order: Kaevarian Templar
*(~1,000 fighters, paladins, and clerics)*

A knightly order of the Kaevarian Church, the Templar are a relatively numerous, yet weak, militant order when compared to their contemporaries such as the [Draconic Order](../DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md) or even the [Dread Knights](./DreadKnights.md).

Generally members of the Kaevarian Templar are fighters ([Cavaliers](/Classes/Fighter/Cavalier.md), [Champions](/Classes/Fighter/Champion.md), [Defenders](/Classes/Fighter/Defender.md), or [Samuari](/Classes/Fighter/Samurai.md) in particular) or paladins ([Devotion](/Classes/Paladin/Devotion.md), [Glory](/Classes/Paladin/Glory.md), or [Heroism](/Classes/Paladin/Heroism.md) in particular). Some Kaevarian clerics will join the Templar, but usually as a means to further the aims of the Church rather than any particular zeal for justice.

The Templar are fiercely devoted to the aims and goals of the Kaevarian Church, and they put the orders of a ranking Church authority well higher than that of any secular authority around them. It is rumored that the [Singularian Heresy](/Religions/KaevarianChurch.md#singularian-heresy) is rooted somewhere within the Templar itself, resisting the various theological purges the Kaevarians undertake every so often to rid themselves of it. For this reason, many non-Kaevarians take the arrival of Templar less enthusiastically than they might other militant orders, particularly the Draconic Order.

#### Progression

When interested individuals join the Templar (usually recruited very young), they surrender their last names in a ceremony in which they are dedicated to the Church. They are then assigned to a Templar who will take them on as squires, and train them in martial skills and provide room, board, and equipment in exchange for servitude. After a period  of time, usually between 3 to 5 years, the Templar recommends the squire for promotion to Templar, during which time the squire becomes a full ranking member of the order, and takes the last name of the Templar they served. In this way, the original monikers of the Kaevarian Templare are always kept strong.

#### The Monikers

Some of the common Kaevarian Templar's last names:

* Brightsteel
* Sharpblade
* Strongheart
* Stonewall
* Keenshot
* Swiftshot
* Lightshield
* Hardmount
* Charger
* (others...)

The Pater of the Church is always able to add monikers to the rolls, or to ask a Templar to set aside their given moniker to take a new one, particularly done when the Templar is rewarded for heroism or dedication to the Church.
