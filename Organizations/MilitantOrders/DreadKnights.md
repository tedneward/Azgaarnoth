# Militant Order: The Knights of Dread

The Knights of the Dread Order, or the Knights of the Dradehalian Order as they were originally known, are a militant order of individuals dedicated first to the survival, then to the aims, of the Dread Emperor of Dradehalia. They span all classes, and include most of the races of Azgaarnoth, with careful exception of any of the traditionally Hordish races--no Orc-kin, no Goblin-kin, no Minotaurs, none of the races that have any degree of authority or power in any of the Hordes are allowed except by direct order of the Emperor. (The Dread Emperor has a few prejudices.)

The Dread Knights are led by the Dread Emperor, but most orders come from the Order's Four Corners, four individuals who take the Emperor's requests and concerns and turn them into orders for the Knights. Historically these Dread Lords are each of the four archetypical classes: Martial (Fighter), Arcane (Wizard), Divine (Cleric), and Shadow (Rogue), but over time the positions are more symbolic and representative of the areas of responsibility. The Dread Lord Martial is responsible for the Order's military operations, the Dread Lord Arcane for thinigs magical, the Dread Lord Divine for things spiritual, and the Dread Lord Shadow for things done in the dark of the night.
