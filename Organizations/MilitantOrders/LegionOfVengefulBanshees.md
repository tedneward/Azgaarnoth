# Militant Order: Legion of Vengeful Banshees
*(size unknown; composition unknown)*

Part militant order, part rogues' guild, the Legion is an arm of [The Keeper](../../Religions/Pantheon/Keeper.md) that specializes in wreaking vengeance on those who have (supposedly) betrayed or done wrong by Lady of the Dead, her clergy, her followers, or anyone else who brings a strong enough cause.

Much of the time, Legionnaires know only a few others within the Legion, and most gatherings of more than a half-dozen are conducted in either magical darkness or while masked. Any are welcome within the Legion, so long as they are committed to The Keeper's brutal dogma, and willing to carry out brutal acts of vengeance against others. Besides The Keeper's clergy, wizards (necromancers, diviners, enchanters, and particularly Bloodmancers or NeoBloodmancers), sorcerers (of any background), and rogues (particularly assassins) find themselves quite at home here, as do fallen paladins who have given over to The Keeper, but in truth any class is welcome so long as it is useful. Bards of the College oF Whispers thrive here, but often have their own agenda beyond that of The Keeper's. 

Only The Keeper knows how many are an actual part of the Legion, but rumors and the odd brutal killing on a night filled with wailing and howling often have the commoners convinced that Legionnaires are around every corner, and can destroy a community overnight as paranoia sets in.
