<h1 id="order-of-the-shadow-dragon">Order of the Shadow Dragon</h1>
<p>Leader: Unknown</p>
<p>While most of the Draconic Order denies its existence, a small group of Draconic Knights, dedicated to the cause but tired of the stifling rules that the Golds seem overly fond of, chose to create a quasi-branch of the Draconic Order known as the "Order of the Shadow Dragon". Named after the legendary metallic dragons trapped in the Shadowfell, the Order of the Shadow Dragon belives in a "win at all costs" mentality, even if it means undertaking actions that might even make the Coppers blanch.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="shadow-dragons">Shadow Dragons</h2>
<p>Shadow dragons are metallic dragons tinted a dusky grey by the Shadowfell. Due to their manipulative and often vicious behavior, it is a common misconception that Shadow dragons are descended from the bloodlines of chromatic dragons. This is actually far from the case. Though chromatic dragons can become shadow dragons as well, metallic dragons are far more susceptible to this transformation, as the dark powers that exist in the Shadowfell seem to enjoy corrupting good-hearted souls more.</p>
<h3 id="physiological-observations">Physiological Observations</h3>
<p>Shadow dragons are easily distinguishable from other dragon types due to their coloration, which gradually fades from their original color to a charcoal hue that can range from grey to black. They maintain the physical features of their original dragon subtype; for example, a gold shadow dragon will have sail-like wings and long flexible spines dangling from either side of its face. Viewed from very close, the inside of a shadow dragon’s scales retains the dragons original coloration, occasionally shining through where the edges of the scales rub against each other. Of course, shadow dragons are rarely seen unless they choose to be. In darkness, a shadow dragon’s body becomes transparent and can be seen through, as though it were composed of dark smoke. Blades, weapons, and even most spells barely effect this incorporeal form. Of course, the shadow dragon can choose to make certain parts of its body briefly corporeal – generally, its claws and teeth.</p>
<p>In daylight, shadow dragons in their true form are blinded, and it can be noticed that their eyes are almost entirely pupil, with very little sclera visible. Their inability to dilate the pupil prevents them from controlling the amount of light that enters their eyes. Metallic dragons who have mastered the ability to change their shape are not affected by this limitation while in humanoid shape, and most spend their daylight hours in this form, posing as humanoids. This combination – the ability to fly and be nearly invisible at night, while posing as humanoids in the day – makes shadow dragons excellent spies and assassins, and this is generally their favorite methodology for resolving conflict. Shadow dragons are almost never seen in their true forms unless they are about to make a kill.</p>
<p>Shadow dragons generally have two breath weapons: the non-damaging breath weapon of their metallic ancestry, and another that stems from their connection to the Shadowfell. The elemental breath weapon of a shadow dragon is replaced by a white mist that appears to hurt the victim’s shadow in the way that the original breath weapon normally would. For example, a silver dragon normally has an icy breath, so a silver shadow dragon would breathe out a mist that appears to freeze their opponent’s shadow. A gold dragon normally has fiery breath, so a gold shadow dragon would breathe out a mist that appears to set their opponent’s shadows on fire. Regardless of the visual effect, all shadow dragons elemental breath weapons deal necrotic damage. If the victim is killed by this effect, their shadows separate from their body after a few moments, rising as undead shadows that are under the complete control of the dragon.</p>
<h3 id="behaviorial-observations">Behaviorial Observations</h3>
<p>Shadow dragons tend to have the same general personality of their dragon type. For example, brass dragons are talkative, bronze dragons oppose tyranny, and copper dragons have a good sense of humor. However, the Shadowfell alters the personality of every shadow dragon, causing significant mental instability. Every shadow dragon is consumed by one of the traditional “seven deadly sins.” A shadow dragon consumed by pride might set itself up as the ruler of a society. A shadow dragon consumed by greed or envy might be a merchant king. A dragon consumed by gluttony is a rapacious predator. And a dragon consumed by lust is… well, best not to think about.</p>
<p>Regardless of which vice they succumb to, all shadow dragons become homicidally dangerous when their ability to indulge in their innate vice is threatened. For example, the aforementioned pride dragon that rules a kingdom might generally be a fair and just ruler – it prides itself on having the respect of its subjects. However, if one of those subjects does not show it enough deference, the dragon will unhesitatingly roast them alive. Or perhaps a neighboring kingdom doesn’t show enough respect to the dragon. Where a mortal king might simply ignore an accidental slight to his ego, the dragon monarch would declare war. To a shadow dragon, their innate vice eclipses everything. Thus, even the most virtuous of shadow dragons are dangerous creatures which need to be interacted with cautiously. To make matters worse, shadow dragons do not know what their “vice” is, or even that they have one – from their perspective, their vice is perfectly rational and it is the rest of the world which is illogical. In this way, the Shadowfell corrupts even the most pure-hearted metallic dragons.</p>
<h3 id="social-observations">Social Observations</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, shadow dragons gradually become neutral or evil in alignment. They start with good goals, but are absolutely ruthless in how they choose to pursue those goals, and when this is combined with an uncontrollable urge to indulge in some sort of vice, the combination can be quite unpleasant. Most shadow dragons consider themselves to be good, but a more “pragmatic” good than their naïve cousins. They have a ruthless “the means justifies the end” mentality that can often be quite horrific in its application. For example, a silver dragon might try to improve a human society by educating and guiding it. A silver shadow dragon, on the other hand, might try to improve that society through eugenics, gradually eliminating “unworthy” bloodlines.</p>
<p>Shadow dragons tend to be urban creatures, and often make lairs in a city, storing their treasure in vast underground basements that are guarded by their servants – both living and undead. Despite their terrifying abilities, shadow dragons prefer to rule from the shadows rather than openly seizing power. In a city controlled by a shadow dragon, most of the residents will not even be aware of the dragon’s existence – they will simply learn over time that the night is something to be feared. Residents who oppose the dragon’s goals will simply disappear one evening, walking into a patch of white mist and never being seen alive again. Shadows lurk everywhere, spying on conversations which they whisper back to their dark master. Even the rulers of the city may not be aware of the true nature of the creature they serve – all they know is that this person knows more secrets than they have a right to, and controls a veritable army of undead. A group of adventurers unfamiliar with shadow dragons may easily leap to the wrong conclusion and assume that the nobles are being manipulated by vampires or lycanthropes.</p>
<h3 id="inter-species-observations">Inter-Species Observations</h3>
<p>Chromatic dragons tend to be terrified of shadow dragons, although they would never openly admit it. Since most shadow dragons consider themselves to be metallic dragons, they are inherently hostile to chromatics. However, their transformation makes them vicious and lacking in any ethical restrictions. The very first opening move in a conflict with another dragon is to send an army of shadows out to hunt down and kill the other dragon’s eggs.</p>
<p>Metallic dragons are not particularly well inclined towards shadow dragons either. In situations where the shadow dragon was once a metallic that was gradually tainted by the Shadowfell, they generally have friendships or alliances with other metallic dragons, and these relationships may survive their transformation. However, at the very least the shadow dragon will be considered by other metallic dragons to be mentally ill, and even their former friends will treat them with caution.</p>
<p>Shadow dragons have a very dangerous view of humanoids – they consider every humanoid to be a potential pawn or puppet. Their stealthy nature and shapeshifting ability makes it easy for shadow dragons to gather blackmail on people of influence, and if a person is not susceptible to this form of compulsion, a simple breath is enough to turn them into an undead shadow willing to obey the shadow dragon’s every command. Humanoids who interact with shadow dragons must be aware that at the back of the dragon’s mind is a constant calculus of "Is this creature more valuable to me alive or dead?" and conduct their interactions accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="dms-toolkit">DM's Toolkit</h3>
<p>For a shadow dragon, creating an army of minions is literally as easy as breathing. As such, they make ideal BBEGs for your campaign. Their abilities and personality makes them best suited for hit-and-run tactics. During the daytime, a shapeshifted shadow dragon might pretend to be a peddler and accompany the PCs to a town, learning about their strengths and weaknesses the entire time. Then it transforms, takes wing, and breathes on the town, turning them all into shadows to attack the PCs. After PC warriors have been weakened by the shadows Strength-draining attacks, the shadow dragon will move in for the kill.</p>
<p>Shadow dragons who are spellcasters favor spells that provide darkness or obscurement, such as Darkness or Stinking Cloud. This allows them to skew battles in their favor (since they have blindsight, they can see perfectly well under such circumstances) while also providing them with protection from the sun if they have to fight in daylight. A shadow dragon that is forced to fight in bright light (especially daylight) will choose to flee if these protections are dispelled.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that due to their Living Shadow feature, a shadow dragon that fights in the dark effectively has twice as many hit points as another dragon of the same age. Like all dragons, shadow dragons are highly intelligent creatures and will use this to their advantage. When applying the shadow dragon template to a normal dragon, increase the CR by 3 to reflect this.</p>
