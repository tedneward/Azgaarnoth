# Militant Order: Order of the Aster
*(~5,000; primarily fighters, paladins, clerics, and rangers)*

Members of this order protect temples and shrines to [Lathander](../../Religions/Pantheon/Lathander.md), serve to lead large military groups levied as needed to serve the church, and roam the land seeking to do good in Lathander's name and promote his worship. Individual temples and shrines of Lathander do not usually maintain standing military forces of substantial size due to their cost, although they often retain warriors and members of the Order of the Aster to guard their establishments in numbers that each temple decides are appropriate and affordable.
