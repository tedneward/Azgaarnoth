# Mercenary Company: Golden Drake Company

More of an adventuring company, the Golden Drake is a revolving-door of adventurers who are known to move across the land, looking for injustices to correct. They never number more than six, and although some members retire, it is extremely rare for any member to come back out of retirement, even under the most stressful situations.
