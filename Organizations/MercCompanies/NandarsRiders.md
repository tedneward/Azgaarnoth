# Mercenary Company: Nandar's Riders
Originally formed out of a Travesimian cavalry battalion cut off by Lirian troops, Nandar's Riders have seen long and storied service in Chidia for several hundred years. Recently, however, they seem to have turned much more bloodthirsty than the average mercenary company, and their commander, Jerl Lishein, seems uninclined to hear any arguments that his men have turned rogue.

Three cavalry companies:
* 1st: 100 heavy cavalry
* 2nd: 150 light cavalry
* 3rd: 125 light cavalry

Usually winters near [Cliront](/Cities/Cliront.md).
