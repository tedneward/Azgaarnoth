# Mercenary Company: Thieving Daggers
A company of "recon scouts" that are barely above a gang of thieves, the Daggers, formally chartered as "Dulec's Daggers", are rife with rogues, and often take jobs that no other company will touch. They often engage in outright assassination of opponents, and are infamous for a willingness to ignore the Code when it suits them.
