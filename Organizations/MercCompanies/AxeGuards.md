# Mercenary Company: Axe Guards
The Axe Guards are a collection of mercenary companies that grew out of the legions of heavy dwarven infantry that formed the core of the shock troops in the various Dwarven Returns. After the disastrous Eighth Return, the Axe Guards' commander took the various companies to mercenary status, swearing that they will never serve in another Return until the Dwarven Courts and the Courts-in-Exile are reconciled and thus able to afford the Guards' rates.

While several of the Guards' companies have been lost over the years, most of the 25 companies remain, and are each a separate and independent company. However, they refuse to take the field against other Guards units, and stipulate so openly within their contracts.
