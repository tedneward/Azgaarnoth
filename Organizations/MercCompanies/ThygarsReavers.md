# Mercenary Company: Thygar's Reavers
When Coll Thygar (Human Fighter 7 LN), commander of a company in the now-defunct Four Rivers Battalion, was cut off by a particularly bold and risky maneuver by Nandar's Riders, he surrendered his company of 150 men in keeping with the traditions of the Code, expecting to be able to march his men to safety in exchange for non-participation. For whatever reason, the Riders either ignored or refused the surrender, and proceeded to attack the company in vicious fashion. Thygar rallied his men, dug in, resisted the attack, found the remnants of another company from a different merc company also refused surrender by the Riders, and eventually marched a hundred grimly-determined survivors to safety a week later. Vowing revenge, Thygar formed his Reavers, declared blood feud against the Riders, and has been keen to place himself and his survivors on the other side of any conflict the Riders are in.

After spending a year pooling their cash, recovering equipment and reorganizing, the survivors of the Riders' bloodthirst recovered, re-trained, adapted to each other, and began life as a mixed infantry and cavalry company. Being an infantry commander, Thygar was at first hesitant to use his cavalry arm for much more than scouting and light harrassment, but with additional time came familiarity and experience, and Thygar is now competent--if not distinguished--as a cavalry commander.
 
Having been around for close to ten years, the Reavers have generally accorded well of themselves, serving with distinction in each of the campaigns they contracted into.

Four companies:
* Cavalry: commander Swedfer (Human Fighter 9, LN); 40 light horsemen
* 1st Infantry: commander Shakolan (Half-orc Fighter 8, CN); 2 heavy infantry platoons (50 men each), 1 fire platoon (20 men, 2 magi)
* 2nd Infantry: commander Morganslight Ironseat (Dwarf Fighter 6, LG); 3 heavy infantry platoons (50 men each)
* 3rd Infantry: commander Evenslight Ironseat (Dwarf Fighter 5, LG); 1 light infantry platoon (50 men), 2 fire platoons (40 longbownmen each)

Usually winters in [Britespell](/Cities/Britespell.md) or [Dusrest](/Cities/Dusrest.md).
