# Merchant Guild: Vekku Guild
**Organization:** Yithian corporation

**Guild headquarters:** [Shiagan](../../Cities/Shiagan.md)

**Leader:** Lady Vetra Melsibe (female kobold sorcerer 11)

The Vekku Guild is unusual in that it is a guild originally incorporated by a kobold tribe (the Vekku tribe), and has remained almost exclusively in the hands of kobolds ever since its formation. It represents kobold artisans almost exclusively, purchasing raw materials for them and supplying stores and shops with the finished products in return. It has a strong relationship with the Yithi and Zhi governments, and has begun to ship goods into Tragekia (without needing to resort to smuggling).
