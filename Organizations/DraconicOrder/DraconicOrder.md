# The Draconic Orders
The Draconic Orders were formed ages ago as a quasi-religious collection of individuals who sought to wrest order from the chaos and evil they saw in the world. Each Order is built around a different metallic dragon and their characteristics, and the members of each Order seek to make the world a safer, more civilized place, each in their own way.
 
It is important to note that many, if not most, members of the Orders have never seen a dragon (and certainly would not deem themselves worthy to ride one!), and a high percentage of the general population consider dragons to be a myth or legend or exaggeration of a more mundane creature. Despite (most) never having laid eyes on one, however, most members of the Draconic Orders are dedicated to the cause, and champion their namesakes in the knowledge that it serves to make Azgaarnoth a better world overall.
 
The Draconic Orders are particularly always on the lookout for activities of the [Wyrm Cults](../CultOfTheWyrm.md), and will prioritize the elimination of a Cult group at every opportunity.

## History

## The Orders
The orders are broken down by each metallic dragon type:
* [Order of the Platinum Dragon](Platinum.md)
* [Order of the Gold Dragon](Gold.md)
* [Order of the Silver Dragon](Silver.md)
* [Order of the Copper Dragon](Copper.md)
* [Order of the Bronze Dragon](Bronze.md)
* [Order of the Brass Dragon](Brass.md)
* [Order of the Steel Dragon](Steel.md)

It is rumored that the Draconic Orders include other, non-publicized orders, such as the supposed "Order of the Iron Dragon," after those dragons that predated the steel dragons, or the "Order of the Mercury Dragon," after the dragons supposedly made from quicksilver (mercury). It is never clear whether these dragons ever existed, or were part of the Draconic Orders, but the rumors persist nevertheless.

Periodically, a particularly creative robber band or group of bandits will attempt to masquerade as a new Draconic Order, usually named after another metal, such as the "Order of the Electrum Dragon" several hundred years ago that essentially took over [Doglen](/Cities/Doglen.md) for a few decades until the Draconic Orders heard of the deceit and faced them down. It was rumored that an actual dragon participated in the combat--to demonstrate the authenticity of the Draconic Orders that the pretenders lacked--but no one believes the rumors, particularly since the observers could never agree on which species of dragon appeared. It has become common, however, for Draconic Order initiates to be hazed by their veteran peers by teaching them a completely fictitious history of this seventh Order, quite often leading to bogus quests in search of nonexistent "Electrum Dragons' Eggs".
