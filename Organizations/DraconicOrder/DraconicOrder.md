# The Draconic Orders
The Draconic Orders were formed ages ago as a quasi-religious collection of individuals who sought to wrest order from the chaos and evil they saw in the world. Each Order is built around a different metallic dragon and their characteristics, and the members of each Order seek to make the world a safer, more civilized place, each in their own way.
 
It is important to note that many, if not most, members of the Orders have never seen a dragon (and certainly would not deem themselves worthy to ride one!), and a high percentage of the general population consider dragons to be a myth or legend or exaggeration of a more mundane creature. Despite (most) never having laid eyes on one, however, most members of the Draconic Orders are dedicated to the cause, and champion their namesakes in the knowledge that it serves to make Azgaarnoth a better world overall.
 
The Draconic Orders are particularly always on the lookout for activities of the [Wyrm Cults](../CultOfTheWyrm.md), and will prioritize the elimination of a Cult group at every opportunity.
