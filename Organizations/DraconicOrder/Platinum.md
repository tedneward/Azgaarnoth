# Order of the Platinum Dragon
Leader: Lord Targio Marduk

The Draconic Orders' highest pinnacle of martial skill and servitude, members of the Platinum Order are considered the elite of the elite, bordering on the reverent. One of the strictest of the martial orders within the Draconic Order, Platinum Knights represent the highest ideals of draconic integrity, calling, and moral standing. Platinum Knights serve as de facto leadership of the Draconic Orders when cross-Order organization and communication is required. However, the Platinums understand that simply being a Platinum Knight does not make them wiser in battlefield combat than the [Bronze](Bronze.md), more scholarly than the [Brass](Brass.md), or craftier than the [Copper](Copper.md); leadership means finding ways to put each of the elements of the Draconic Order into maximum effect, and serving as the rallying point when necessary.
 
They are often stern and very disapproving of evil, always arguing for crusades against it, without advocating self-destruction in the process. They accept no excuses for evil acts, and don't tolerate even minor offenses by evil creatures. In spite of this stance, they also seek to practice compassion for all beings in the multiverse. They espouse empathy for the downtrodden, the dispossessed, and the helpless.
 
They value wisdom, knowledge, prophecies, and songs, and use the great wealth they have amassed over the ages to help those in need, while using the magic items gathered to further their goals. However, they also pursue viciously those who tried to steal from the Order's coffers, as, after all, platinum dragons are often high dispensers of justice.
 
The Platinum Knights understand the value of strength, and constantly seek to improve the strength of their Order by engaging in contest whenever possible, battling with zeal and fervor, sometimes taking it too far and requiring the services of a Silver to heal those who are gravely injured in combat. Such battle within the Order is well understood to be in the general interests of the Order as a whole, and no stigma or shame comes from honorable defeat in such contests. Platinums will also eagerly participate in tournaments and contests organized by the various Fighting Schools, particularly against champions of that School.
 
While Platinums most naturally get along well with Golds and Bronzes, they welcome the company of any of the Orders, and in many cases have married members of other Orders over time.
 
## Membership
Platinum Knights are generally paladins, although multiclass fighter/cleric figures have been known, and even the occasional monk whose fighting prowess has reached epic levels. Generally coming from the ranks of the Gold Order or Bronze Order, it is still not uncommon for a member of another order, such as the Silvers, to also be elevated into these ranks.
 
Rumors abound that the Platinums maintain a monastic fighting Order within their ranks, but no such "Platinum Monk" has ever been seen. Platinum Knights will not speak of the rumors, to either confirm or deny them.
 
Any member must be of Lawful Good alignment, firmly dedicated to the qualities of the platinum dragons: defense of justice, assistance to the less-fortunate, and elimination of those who would perpetuate evil.
