# Dwarven Courts-in-Exile

Originally formed from the seventeen Clan Lords of the Lost Seventeen Cities, the Dwarven Courts-in-Exile have since become [a political power](../Nations/DwarvenCourtsInExile.md) among the dwarves even though they lack any actual land. Built entirely out of the power of the constituent dwarven merchant guilds, and dedicated to the Return to reclaim the Lost Seventeen, the Dwarven Courts-in-Exile have found their power somewhat diminished since the failed Eighth Return three thousand years ago.
