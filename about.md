Azgaarnoth: A D&D 5e world for players in my campaign to tool around in.

[Map](https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/?maplink=https://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/Azgaarnoth.map) made with [Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator](https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/) . The connection between the map tool's name and the world's name is pretty obvious, but felt like a reasonable honor for one of the better map tools I've ever played with. Both browser-based and desktop-based (but they're really just both browser-based; the desktop download is an Electron app, which is a thin wrapper around a browser window running the same code). Note that if you click the above, you're *not* making any changes to my copy, so feel free to explore. A few things aren't "canon" in the map, like city (burb) populations, or military units. I got the map I wanted, and then it looked like a ton of minutiae work to "clean it up".
