# Dragonborn
While the origins of the [elves](Firstborn.md) are thought to be wrapped up in the [Eldar](Eldar.md), and the [dwarves](Firstborn.md)/[gnomes](Firstborn.md)/[halflings](Firstborn.md) in the Exodus, the history of the dragonborn (and their distant kin, tieflings and aasimar) is quite clear: dragonborn are a Created race, given life from dragons' eggs, and from there to flourish on their own. It is thought that even today, dragons periodically place a "firstborn dragonborn" (that is, Created from the egg) as an adoption with a family or other group to refresh the genetics of the race, though if true, it is not discussed among dragonborn. (Whether this is due to ignorance of their parentage or a deeper desire to preserve a secret is not known outside of the firstborn.)

Platinum dragonborn (from The Book of Dragons) are found within Azgaarnoth, though extremely rare. Any platinum dragonborn are inevitably deeply linked to the [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md).
 
Dragonborn, though not nearly as numerous as humans, are found throughout Azgaarnoth, in almost any climate or environment.

* **Ability Score increase**. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

* **Age**. Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.

* **Alignment**. Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who is all alignments at once.

* **Size**. Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

* **Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

* **Languages**. You can read, speak, and write Common and Draconic.

## Draconic Ancestry
You are distantly related to a particular kind of dragon. Choose a type of dragon; this determines the damage and area of your breath weapon, and the type of resistance you gain.

------------ | ----------- | -------------
Black	| Acid | 5' by 30' line (DEX save)
Blue	| Lightning | 5' by 30' line (DEX save)

### Breath Weapon
You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. It deals damage in an area according to your ancestry. When you use your breath weapon, all creatures in the area must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your ancestry. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increase to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th, and 5d6 at 16th level. You may use your breath weapon a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier. You regain expended uses on a long rest.

### Damage Resistance
You have resistance to the damage type associated with your ancestry.

# Platinum Dragonborn
The platinum dragonborn are different from the other dragonborn in one way: the are not born. They are re-born. They enter life as any other humanoid: an elf, a halfling, a human, even a tiefling, as a few examples. A humanoid who pledges its life to the service of the [Order of the Platinum Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Platinum.md), it is said, can undergo the rituals required to become a true emissary of the paragon of metallic dragons. That said, however, the rite is rumored to be extensive and exhausting, both physically, mentally, and emotionally, and only those who have truly dedicated themselves to supporting the ideals of the Draconic Order will have a chance of acceptance. Past actions do not seem to matter; the Platinum Order has several examples of evil creatures willingly turning their back on their past lives and undergoing the ritual as reptenence and servitude to their new ideals. Any willing creature who passes such a test becomes a son or daughter of the Platinum, giving up all former racial identity and becoming a platinum dragonborn; in fact, the Platinum often will not discuss the history of the platinum dragonborn, preferring in most cases to simply assume that the platinum dragonborn's life began on the day of the ritual.

> #### Game Notes
> Because of the nature of the transformation, a player can start a new character as a platinum dragonborn, or change an existing character's race to Platinum Dragonborn, assuming the DM's approval. Extensive backstory will be required for new characters, and it should include several references to the Draconic Order.

Any platinum dragonborn are inevitably tied to the [Platinum Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Platinum.md); the Order adopts any platinum dragonborn it finds in the wild, and any platinum dragonborn who do not wish said adoption are immediately given an honor guard of Platinum Knights (and, supposedly, several [Copper](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Copper.md) agents) to look over them. The Platinum will quite jealously and stubbornly guard the dragonborn, particularly since the [Cult of the Wyrm](/Organization/CultOfTheWyrm.md) would love nothing more than to corrupt one to their cause.

A platinum dragonborn appears as any other dragonborn, but with scales of platinum, and they have a certain aura around them. Their scales seem to shimmer and the very air around them seems to carry a divine presence (regardless of class or specialization). Because of the ritual that the humanoid undergoes, it changes from its previous race to a platinum dragonborn, losing all traits of its previous race and gaining all traits of its new race.

Every head of the [Platinum Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Platinum.md) has been a platinum dragonborn for as long as there have been records of the Draconic Orders. The rite involved to become one is the most closely-guarded secret the Draconic Orders have.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Strength score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 1. Because you are not used to your new form, for one month after the ritual your Dexterity score decreases by 2, and returns to normal after that time is past.

* **Age**. A normal Dragonborn will live to be about 80. However, a platinum dragonborn is blessed with unusually long life. After emerging from the egg, the dragonborn will be adult regardless of the age she had been previously. It is from this rebirth that she then begins to track her age. They reach middle-age around 200 years, and will live to be between 400 or 500 years old.

* **Alignment**. To even be considered for the ritual, the humanoid must not be evil. They retain their original alignment, but most are good. A select few are neutral.

* **Size**. Platinum dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost
250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

* **Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

* **Draconic Ancestry**. Because of the ritual, you have become a true paragon of dragonborn-kind. This grants you your breath weapon, damage resistance, and the ability to speak Draconic.

* **Breath Weapon**. You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your breath weapon is a bright, shining line that coruscates with every metallic color. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 radiant damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

  After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

* **Damage Resistance**. The transformation into platinum dragonborn blesses you with one resistance of your choice: acid, cold, lightning, or fire. This choice cannot be changed.

* **Languages**. You can speak. read, and write Draconic, if you did not know it previously, in addition to all languages you knew before the ritual.

* **Subrace (Aspect)**. Platinum dragonborn, as part of the ritual, either choose (or are chosen) to take on one of the three aspects that set the platinum dragons apart from their kind, ostensibly as a way to to set platinum dragonborn apart from other dragonborn. The three aspects of platinum dragonborn are Heart, Mind, or Might. This choice cannot be changed.

  * ***Heart*** A dragonborn who chooses Heart as her aspect gains an unbreakable will and a more advanced breath weapon. She will never falter, no matter the odds.
    * **Ability Score Increase**. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

    * **Draconic Bravery**. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

    * **Misty Breath**. When you use your breath weapon, you can choose to exhale a cloud of mist instead of destructive energy. The mist has a 15-foot radius centered around you and functions as if cast with the fog cloud spell.

  * ***Mind*** A dragonborn who chooses Mind as her aspect gains sharpened intellect and senses.

    * **Ability Score Increase**. Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

    * **Senses**. You gain proficiency in the Perception skill (if you did not have it already), and darkvision out to 30 feet. If you already had darkvision, its range increases to 60 feet. When you reach 11th level, you also gain blindsight with a radius of 5 feet.

  * **Might** A dragonborn who chooses Might as her aspect gains a portion of her father's strength and power. They are tougher and stronger than other warriors and are terrible foes to face. 
    * **Ability Score Increase**. Your Constitution score increases by 1.

    * **Draconic Strength**. You count as one size larger when calculating carry weight and the amount of weight you can manipulate.

    * **Draconic Fortitude**. When an attack hits you and the damage dealt would reduce you to 0 hit points, it reduces you to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this ability again until you finish a long rest.
