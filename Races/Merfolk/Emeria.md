# Emeria (Wind) Creed
Merfolk who followed Emeriaâ€™s creed seek wisdom and truth in the Wind Realm, exploring the mystical forces--rather than natural causes--behind historical events. They are evasive and intentionally enigmatic in their interactions with others, and are often described as manipulative and deceptive.

* **Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score increases by 2.
* **Wind Creed Manipulation.** You have proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.
* **Cantrip.** You know one cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.
