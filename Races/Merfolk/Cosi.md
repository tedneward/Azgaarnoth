# Cosi (Trickster) Creed
No merfolk will openly admit to following the creed of the trickster, but those who do view Cosi as an ally who can grant them control over the chaotic forces of the world.

* **Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by an additional 1 (for a total of 2), and your Intelligence score increases by 1.
