# Mark of Detection
The Mark of Detection is an inquisitor’s dream. It sharpens powers of observation and intuition, allowing the bearer to draw connections and interpret clues others might miss. By actively drawing on its powers, the bearer can detect poisons and study the energies of magic.

### Traits
The Mark of Detection manifests exclusively on half-elves. If your character has the Mark of Detection, these traits replace the half-elf’s Ability Score Increase, Skill Versatility, and Languages given in the Player’s Handbook.

* **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence and Charisma scores both increase by 1. In addition, one ability score of your choice increases by 1.

* **Deductive Intuition.** When you make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) check, you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add the number rolled to the ability check.

* **Sense Threats.** You can cast the [detect magic](../Magic/Spells/detect-magic.md) and [detect poison and disease](../Magic/Spells/detect-poison-and-disease.md) spells, but only as rituals. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

* **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish.
