# Mark of Warding
The Mark of Warding helps its bearers protect things of value. Using the mark, a dwarf can weave wards and seal portals with mystic force. It also provides its bearer with an intuitive understanding of locks and mechanisms used to protect and seal. The decision each heir has to make is whether they’ll use this power to keep things safe, or whether they’re more interested in opening locks and taking what’s inside.

### Traits
The Mark of Warding manifests exclusively on dwarves. If your character has the Mark of Warding, this is your dwarf subrace.

**Ability Score Increase**. Your Dexterity and Intelligence scores increase by 1.

**Master of Locks**. When you make an Intelligence (History), Intelligence (Investigation), or Thieves' Tools check involving lock and trap mechanisms, you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add the number rolled to the ability check.

**Wards and Seals**. You can use your mark to cast the [alarm](../Magic/Spells/alarm.md) spell as a ritual. Starting at 3rd level you can cast [arcane lock](../Magic/Spells/arcane-lock.md) once with this trait and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
