# Mark of Storm
Wind and water welcome the half-elf who carries the Mark of Storms. The wind catches them when they fall, and they swim with remarkable speed. Those who possess the Greater Dragonmark and dragonshard focus items can call on even greater powers, shaping the weather and calling on the power of the storm.

### Traits
The Mark of Storm manifests exclusively on half-elves. If your character has the Mark of Detection, these traits replace the half-elf’s Ability Score Increase, Skill Versatility, and Languages given in the Player’s Handbook.

**Ability Score Increase**. Your Dexterity and Charisma scores both increase by 1. In addition, one ability score of your choice increases by 1.

**Sea Monkey**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swim speed of 30 feet.

**Windwright’s Intuition**. When you make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or any ability check involving operating or maintaining a water or air vehicle, you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add the number rolled to the ability check.

**Storm’s Blessing**. You have resistance to lightning damage.

**Headwinds**. You know the [gust](../Magic/Spells/gust.md) cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [gust of wind](../Magic/Spells/gust-of-wind.md) spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

**Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish.
