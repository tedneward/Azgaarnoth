## Dark Elf (*drow*)
Elvish scholars speak of an ancient schism amongst the Eldar--and some insist that this was the start of the Fall--that prompted an offshoot of the Eldar to take refuge underground. Rumors hold that these dark elves are the reason (somehow) Mt Bezulb continues to erupt consistently. Note that despite numerous claims to the contrary, *drow* and *shadar-kai* are not the same race, and in fact they seem to have an inborn implacable hatred of one another that defies explanation.

Most *drow* seem to hail from the Daw Mountains near the only active volcano in Azgaarnoth, Mt Bezulb.
