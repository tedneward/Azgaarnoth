# Ancestry and Culture
*(A replacement for the standard racial build of a PC, from [Arcanist Press](https://twitter.com/ArcanistPress/status/1356336296919183365?s=20))*

By virtue of being close to 10,000 years old as a viable civilization, Azgaarnoth has seen many, many "blurrings" of the traditional racial history that might be less common in worlds that are less developed or less socially-mobile. [Hordes](Hordish.md) have lost some of their brutish ways, for example, but that doesn't just flow one way--stories of [Firstborn](Firstborn.md) children captured in Horde raids, or left abandoned on battlefields to be raised by adoptive parents from half a world away, are legion in the histories of Azgaarnoth, and it makes perfect sense that PCs would emerge from among these.

To that end, this page permits PCs to create a "custom" racial build that better reflects the huge "melting pot" that is Azgaarnoth. To do this, players must follow this process:

1. **Basic backstory.** Provide the GM with a basic breakdown of the PC: is this a half-orc raised by elves, or an elf raised by half-orcs, or a human who was adopted by werewolves, or ...? This will help get a clearer view of the PC so that the intent can come through more clearly in the build.

2. **Select ancestry (biological lineage).** Every PC has a biological ancestry, providing ancestral traits: Age, Size, Speed, Senses, and any feats/features. This represents the "physical" makeup of the PC. Some sub-races (such as the Aasimari) have physical features, as well, so either determine that up front, or (if the GM agrees), defer that decision until the last responsible moment. (For example, aasimari receive features at 3rd level, so if the player wishes, that decision could be deferred until 3rd level, at which point the ability score modifications and the new racial features would make themselves known.)

3. **Select culture.** Despite how/where/to whom they were born, PCs are also raised within a culture, which determines their skills and languages.

Within Azgaarnoth, there are several prominent cultures to choose from:
* ...

4. **Ability score increases.** Rather than tying this to any particular racial/physical build, choose +2 in any one ability score, and +1 in another.

> "First, choose your ancestry, representing your parents or biological lineage. This grants you certain ancestral traits, like Age, Size, Darkvision, Breath Weapon, Fey Ancestry, Flight, Amphibious, etc. These work just like one half of the Race trait list."

> "Next, those a culture you were raised in, like elven or gnomish, or maybe mountain or coast, which grants traits like skills and languages. Combined with ancestry, these complete the '#Race' trait list."

> "Last, for ability score increases, add +2 to one and +1 to another ability score, just as #Tashas suggests. Swap out a skill or language as well, if you like."
