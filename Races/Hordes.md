# Hordes
The Hordes have always been here, and if you ask any of them, they will be here long after humans and the firstborn have died off. Hordish society is generally more loose-knit than human or firstborn, but within the last milennia the Hordes appear to be learning lessons about the benefits of civilization, and many are looking for ways to live in greater sense of peace and harmony than before.

## Centaurs
(from [*UA: Centaurs*](/Supplements/UA-Centaur.pdf))
Centaurs are found among the lands of the Hordes ([Ulm](/Nations/Ulm.md) and [Tragekia](/Nations/Tragekia.md)), as well as in the wilds of [North Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md). They are rarely found in the Ravenlands of [Liria](/Nations/Liria.md), but are considered a major ally and asset to the tribe that has one (and ideally more).

## Orcs

### Ogroms

## Ogres

## Goblins

### Hobgoblins

## Bugbears

## Kobolds
Kobolds are thought to be the remnants of the first experiments of the [Eldar](Eldar.md) to create [dragonborn](Created.md), but saying such to any dragonborn is insulting and typically grounds for feud or duel. Nevertheless, the shared draconic lineage between kobold and dragonborn is hard to miss, and some scholars believe that at some point, there was some shared history of the two races.

## Minotaurs
(from [*UA: Centaurs*](/Supplements/UA-Centaur.pdf) or [*UA: Waterborne*](/Supplements/UA_Waterborne_v3.pdf))
Minotaurs are found among the lands of the Hordes ([Ulm](/Nations/Ulm.md) and [Tragekia](/Nations/Tragekia.md)), as well as in the wilds of [North Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md). Minotaurs may be of any alignment, and can expect suspicion when moving around in any of the other lands beyond the Hordeslands. (Note that many minotaurs do take to the seas, so the Sea Ravers template from *UA: Waterborne* should be considered for these; however, these are not minotaurs of Krynn, and do not come from that society.)
