# Hordes
The Hordes have always been here, and if you ask any of them, they will be here long after humans and the firstborn have died off.

Kobolds are thought to be the remnants of the first experiments of the [Eldar](Eldar.md) to create [dragonborn](Created.md), but saying such to any dragonborn is insulting and typically grounds for feud or duel. Nevertheless, the shared draconic lineage between kobold and dragonborn is hard to miss, and some scholars believe that at some point, there was some shared history of the two races.
