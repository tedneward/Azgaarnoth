# Hordes
The Hordes have always been here, and if you ask any of them, they will be here long after humans and the firstborn have died off. Hordish society is generally more loose-knit than human or firstborn, but within the last milennia the Hordes appear to be learning lessons about the benefits of civilization, and many are looking for ways to live in greater sense of peace and harmony than before.

## [Bugbears](Bugbears.md)
Given their innate (and impressive) laziness, it's a wonder that any bugbears ever made their way through the sky to set foot on Azgaarnoth. That said, most bugbears chose to remain faithful to the "Old Ways", and as a result the highest concentration of them is in [Ulm](/Nations/Ulm.md), at least when they're not leading troops into [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md).

## Centaurs
Centaurs are found among the lands of the Hordes ([Ulm](/Nations/Ulm.md) and [Tragekia](/Nations/Tragekia.md)), as well as in the wilds of the [Ravenlands](/Geography/Ravenlands.md) (where they are considered a major ally and asset, and Ravelands tribes frequently seek to cement alliances and membership with centaur herds) and [North Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md). They are rarely found elsewhere in [Liria](/Nations/Liria.md) but they frequently take employment with [Mercenary Companies](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md).

## [Gnoll](Gnoll.md)
Gnolls came as part of the Hordes, but their strong pack mentality (and even stronger dislike of those outside the pack) always kept them apart from the rest of the Hordes. Gnoll packs can be found in any setting some distance away from cities, making [Ulm](/Nations/Ulm.md), [Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md), and the Caliphates prime wandering country. They are found in lesser numbers in the east, principally in [Yithi](/Nations/Yithi.md), and some in [Zhi](/Nations/Zhi.md).

## [Goblins](Goblins.md)
Orcs and goblins make up the mainstay of the Hordes populations, and are most commonly found in [Ulm](/Nations/Ulm.md) and [Tragekia](/Nations/Tragekia.md). Goblins have remained more pure to their origins, and generally are much less "civilized" than many of the rest of their Horde-kin, and as such frequently form the lowest caste in any Horde society. That said, numerous cases of exceptional goblins are known to the worlds, and goblins have been known to show exceptional crafting skills when placed within a more supportive social environment.

### [Hobgoblins](Hobgoblins.md)
Hobgoblins are the "elder brother" of goblins, and most have birth roots in the Hordeslands. However, many have struck out independently, filtered west, and found that the trappings of civilization have positive qualities. Within the last few milennia, hobgoblins have become quite diverse in their skillset, and examples of every class have been found within hobgoblin ranks, including paladins, monks, artificers, and clerics.

## [Orc](Orc.md)
Orcs and goblins make up the mainstay of the Hordes populations, and are most commonly found in [Ulm](/Nations/Ulm.md) and [Tragekia](/Nations/Tragekia.md). Orcs are just as diverse as humans, however, and many of them have begun to take up the idea that a society based on something other than looting and pillaging is not a terrible thing; these form the bulk of the [United Hordes](/Nations/Tragekia.md). Others, however, long to return to more of the "Old Ways", and these have found a home in the [Ulmhorde](/Nations/Ulm.md). Still others remained in [Yithi](/Nations/Yithi.md) and [Zhi](/Nations/Zhi.md) and found ways to interact with the other races there to form the unique tapestry there that is part-human, part-Firstborn, part-Horde, and all unique.

Despite the racial stereotype, orcs are no more prone to brutish violence than humans or other mortals. They are not as common in the west as they are in the east, but enough of them have migrated out of the Hordeslands that they are not unknown.

### [Half-orcs](Halves.md)
While many half-orcs are found in Hordes lands ([Tragekia](/Nations/Tragekia.md) and [Ulm](/Nations/Ulm.md)) as the children of orcs and captured humans, many more are found in [Yithi](/Nations/Yithi.md) and [Zhi](/Nations/Zhi.md) as the result of much more stable (and less violent) relationships, and still more are found all across Azgaarnoth by this point. It appears that the half-orc genetic trait breeds true: if two half-orcs have children, their child is a half-orc (and not a "true" human or "true" orc, except rarely).

Despite the racial stereotype, half-orcs are no more prone to brutish violence or thuggery than humans or any of the [Firstborn](/Races/Firstborn.md). In fact, some of the sharpest instructors in magic are half-orcs at the various [Mage Schools](/Organizations/MageSchools/MageSchools.md).

### Ogroms

## [Lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md)
Lizardfolk are populous in the marshes around [Mudhear](/Cities/Mudhear.md), among some other places along the northern coasts (where the water is warm). Additionally, it is thought that the lizardfolk are also in much larger numbers in the [Undersea](/Geography/Undersea.md), but again, it isn't clear.

## [Kenku](Kenku.md)
Kenku are found anywhere in Azgaarnoth, though sparingly.

## [Kobolds](Kobolds.md)
Kobolds are thought to be the remnants of the first experiments of the [Eldar](Eldar.md) to create [dragonborn](Created.md), but saying such to any dragonborn is insulting and typically grounds for feud or duel. Nevertheless, the shared draconic lineage between kobold and dragonborn is hard to miss, and some scholars believe that at some point, there was some shared history of the two races.

## [Minotaurs](Minotaurs.md)
Minotaurs are found among the lands of the Hordes ([Ulm](/Nations/Ulm.md) and [Tragekia](/Nations/Tragekia.md)), as well as in the wilds of [North Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md). Minotaurs may be of any alignment, and can expect suspicion when moving around in any of the other lands beyond the Hordeslands.

## Ogres

## Trolls

## [Yuan-ti Pureblood](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/yuan-ti)
These are exceedingly rare, and (openly) found only in the deepest parts of [Zhi](/Nations/Zhi.md). It is thought that some yuan-ti have taken up with the lizardfolk in the marshes around [Mudhear](/Cities/Mudhear.md), but there is no clear answer.
