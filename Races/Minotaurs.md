# Minotaurs
Born the strongest of the Hordes, minotaurs swiftly discovered that they had no love of leadership or organization, and swiftly moved to either take what was theirs by right, or by force, and soon separated from the rest into their own clans. They could be brought out to join the Hordes in battle as a clan if persuaded by the right amounts of tribute, treasure, or other offerings, and many believe the minotaur clans were the first [Mercenary Companies](../Organizations/MercCompanies/index.md). (In fact, several mercenary companies are either made up entirely out of a minotaur clan, or feature minotaurs prominently in the leadership structure today.)

Minotaurs found in [Yithi](../Nations/Yithi.md) and (less often) [Zhi](../Nations/Zhi.md) are quite strikingly different from their Horde-homed brethren, frequently solitary, thoughtful, and quite committed to rule of law and order.

Minotaurs are often drawn to the more martial classes, such as fighter or barbarian, but minotaurs are found within all of the classes.

## Culture
Minotaurs embrace the notion that the weak should perish and that the strong must rule—=and that they themselves are the strongest and most powerful race in Azgaarnoth. They believe their destiny is to rule the world, and that their dominion will be one of conquest and military might. To that end, all minotaurs are trained in weapons, armor, and tactics from a young age. The minotaurs’ arrogance stems from a combination of strength, cunning, and intellect—-three virtues they hold dear, and which they deem the foundation of their greatness. They believe that this combination of traits is what sets them apart from their rivals.

## Honor Above All
For all their cruelty, minotaurs are bound by a powerful sense of honor. Each victory brings greater honor to both individual minotaurs and their families. Defeat invokes a stain that only death can fully wash away.

Honor demands that minotaurs keep their word once it is offered, and each minotaur remains faithful to friends and clan above all else. Minotaurs rarely befriend folk of other races, as they all too often encounter them only in battle. If a minotaur does strike up a friendship, it is typically with other creatures that display the minotaurs’ virtues and love of battle. To such friends, a minotaur becomes an ally whose support will never waver.
