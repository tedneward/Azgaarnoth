# [Minotaurs](../Creatures/Minotaur.md)

Minotaurs found in [Yithi](../Nations/Yithi.md) and (less often) [Zhi](../Nations/Zhi.md) are quite strikingly different from their Horde-homed brethren: frequently solitary, thoughtful, and quite committed to rule of law and order.

## Traits
* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

* **Age**. Minotaurs enter adulthood at around the age of 17 and can live up to 150 years.

* **Size**. Minotaurs typically stand well over 6 feet tall and weigh an average of 300 pounds. Your size is Large.

* **Hit Points.** You start with 6d10 + (6 * CON bonus) hit points. Thse are "base" hit points, and do not count as Hit Dice for use during short rest periods, for example. These also do not count as character "levels"; thus, a Minotaur Fighter 1 has 1 Hit Dice and is 1 level, even though they have 6d10 + 1d10 + (7 * CON bonus) total hit points. *(GM's note: For this reason, minotaur PCs should usually be a few levels behind their peers, as a means of keeping balance.)*

* **Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

* **Horns**. You are never unarmed. You are proficient with your horns, which are a melee weapon that deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier piercing damage. Your horns grant you advantage on all checks made to shove a creature, but not to avoid being shoved yourself.

* **Goring Rush**. When you use the Dash action during your turn, you can make a melee attack with your horns as a bonus action.

* **Hammering Horns**. When you use the Attack action during your turn to make a melee attack, you can attempt to shove a creature with your horns as a bonus action. You cannot use this shove attempt to knock a creature prone.

* **Menacing.** You	have proficiency in the Intimidation skill. 

* **Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Common.

* **Alignment**. Minotaurs believe in a strict code of honor, and thus tend toward law. They are loyal to the death and make implacable enemies, even as their brutal culture and disdain for weakness push them toward evil.

* **Hybrid Nature**. You have two creature types: humanoid and monstrosity. You can be affected by a game effect if it works on either of your creature types.
