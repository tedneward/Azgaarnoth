# Genasi
Thought to trace their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements. [Air](#air), [earth](#earth), [fire](#fire), and [water](#water) — these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of genasi. Some genasi are direct descendants of a genie, while others were born to non-genasi parents who lived near a place suffused by a genie’s magic.

A typical genasi has a life span of 120 years.

Within Azgaarnoth, genasi are often viewed with a certain amount of suspicion or glee, depending on the locals' relationship to the nearest source of elemental power (and how it's treated the locals recently). Fire genasi born after the eruption of Mt Belzulb (and there were many!) were often cast out of their villages, but are often prized as family members among artisans and Merchant Guilds. Earth genasi born to Ulmhorde tribes are often cast out, but welcomed within Yithi and Zhi. Air genasi are loved among the Al'Uma, but viewed with suspicion elsewhere. And so on.

> GM Notes: Between the fact that genasi are rare (less than 5% of the population) and because the general populace is not clear on whether the Eldar had a hand in the creation of the genasi, most Azgaarians--regardless of national culture or lineage--have not fully formed their opinions of these kin of the genie. As a result, genasi often grow up wary, never knowing what their reception will be like; similarly, genasi are one of the few races on Azgaarnoth that will elicit stares from city-dwelllers and townsfolk alike.

## Air
Air genasi resemble djinn, the genies of the Elemental Plane of Air. Embodying many of the airy traits of their otherworldly ancestors, air genasi can draw upon their connection to the winds.

Air genasi’s skin tones include many shades of blue, along with the full range of human skin tones, with bluish or ashen casts. Sometimes their skin is marked by lines that seem like cracks with bluish-white energy spilling out. An air genasi’s hair might blow in a phantom wind or be made entirely of clouds or vapor.

## Earth
Tracing their ancestry to dao, the genies of the Elemental Plane of Earth, earth genasi inherit dao’s steadfast strength and control over earth.

An earth genasi’s skin can be the colors of stone and earth or a human skin tone with glittering sparkles like gem dust. Some earth genasi have lines marking their skin like cracks, either showing glimmering gemlike veins or a dim, yellowish glow. Earth genasi hair can appear carved of stone or crystal or resemble strands of spun metal.

## Fire
Descended from efreet, the genies of the Elemental Plane of Fire, fire genasi channel the flamboyant and often destructive nature of flame. They show their heritage in their skin tones, which can range from deep charcoal to shades of red and orange. Some bear skin tones common to humanity but with fiery marks, such as slowly swirling lights under their skin that resemble embers or glowing red lines tracing over their bodies like cracks. Fire genasi hair can resemble threads of fire or sooty smoke.

## Water
Water genasi descend from marids, aquatic genies from the Elemental Plane of Water. Water genasi are perfectly suited to life underwater and carry the power of the waves inside themselves.

Their skin is often shades of blue or green, sometimes a blend of the two. If they have a human skin tone, there is a glistening texture that catches the light, like water droplets or nearly invisible fish scales. Their hair can resemble seaweed, waving as if in a current, or it can even be like water itself.
