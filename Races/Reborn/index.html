<h1 id="reborn">Reborn</h1>
<p>Death isn't always the end. The reborn exemplify this, being individuals who have died yet, somehow, still live. Some reborn exhibit the scars of fatal ends, their ashen flesh or bloodless veins making it clear that they've been touched by death. Some others appear identical to those of other races, their scars borne entirely on the mind rather than on the flesh. Whatever their origins, reborn know a new life and seek experiences and answers all their own.</p>
<p>Reborn are often "driven" by some purpose or concern, usually something to do with their lost memories and origins, and often find themselves compelled to take certain actions or journies that they do not understand until much, much later. They tend to be isolated and alone, as the undead nature of their rebirth often subtly (or openly) repels others who do not share the same lineage. Even other Reborn tend to steer clear of each other, as their soul-deep driving goals often do not partner well with others of the same mindset.</p>
<p>It is thought that some reborn were "assembled" millennia ago, but only recently came back into life, while others are naturally-recurring. Very little is known of the reborn physiology, and attempts to study them have generally met with obstacles and failure.</p>
<h2 id="faded-memories">Faded Memories</h2>
<p>Reborn suffer from some manner of discontinuity, an interruption of their lives or physical state that their minds are ill equipped to deal with. Their memories of events before this interruption are often vague or absent.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the most unexpected experiences might cause sensations or visions of the past to come rushing back.</p>
<p>Rather than sleeping, reborn regularly sit and dwell on the past, hoping for some revelation of what came before. Most of the time, these are dark, silent stretches. Occasionally, though, in a moment of peace, stress, or excitement, a reborn gains a glimpse of what came before. When you desire to have such a dreamlike vision, roll on the Lost Memories table to inspire its details.</p>
