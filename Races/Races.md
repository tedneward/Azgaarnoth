# Races of Azgaarnoth

## [Eldar](Eldar.md)
The Eldar, mythical beings that supposedly walked the earth in the ancient times, no longer exist, but drive much of the history of Azgaarnoth. It is believed they are the ones who created first the [Firstborn](Firstborn.md), then later the [Humans](Humans.md) and then the [Created](Created.md). Physical descriptions of the Eldar are rare, but what is known is that they were humanoid in shape, thought to be often eight to twelve feet in height, and glowing with mysical power. (There is a school of thought that giants are their long-descended and -fallen kin, but much remains inexplicable if that is the case--including how the Eldar fell so far.)

## [Hordes](Hordes.md)
Legend holds that the Hordes descended upon Azgaarnoth from "someplace else", but from there the legends vary wildly as to the origin of the massive numbers of humanoids that sought to take Azgaarnoth by force from the Eldar.

## [Firstborn](Firstborn.md)
The Firstborn include the dwarves (and their cousins, the gnomes and halflings) and the elves. Each was given a different part of the world to caretake, and all were involved in the war against the [Hordes](Hordes.md) when they arrived. The Eldar's Dragon companions later sought to aid the Firstborn by bestowing the [Dragonmark](Dragonmarked.md) upon several, which turned out (intentional or otherwise) to be something that could be passed down through generations to both Firstborn and humans.

* [Elf](Elves.md)
* [Gith](Gith.md)
* [Gnome](Gnomes.md)
* [Halfling](Halflings.md)

## [Humans](Humans.md)
Humans were brought into being by the Eldar as a swiftly-breeding and general-purpose supplement to the Firstborn. The capacity and creativity and adaptability of humans swiftly earned them a place of respect among the Eldar and the Firstborn. In particular, one particular "quirk" of human physiology is their ability to mate successfully with almost any of the other races on Azgaarnoth, leading to the "halves", those of mixed racial parentage.

* [Half-Dragon](Halves.md)
* [Half-Elf](Halves.md)
* [Half-Orc](Halves.md)

## [Created](Created.md)
The third of the racial groups that the Eldar brought into being, the Created represent the Eldar's efforts to imbue their creations with more gifts and abilities than their previous creations, as a final effort to help tip the scales against the might of the Hordes. In particular, it is said that the Created were made with the aid of the Eldar's Dragon partners, and the influences definitely show.

* [Dragonborn](Dragonborn.md)
* [Dragonkin](Dragonkin.md)
* [Tiefling](Tiefling.md)

## [Undersea](Undersea.md)

Recently, visitors claiming to be from under the surface of the waves have appeared on Azgaarnothian shores, and the Sea Elves confirm that these races have just as rich a history and culture as any race of the land.
