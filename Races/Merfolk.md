# Merfolk

Merfolk are an amphibious race, born and at home in the water but comfortable on dry land. Humanoid in form, they have skin of ivory, silver, russet, blue, or deep purple. Long fins extend from the backs of their forearms and calves, and their fingers and toes are webbed. The hairlike growths on their heads are either thick and bristly like the needles of a sea urchin, or long and wavy, resembling fine seaweed. In either case, these growths typically range in color from red to warm brown to black. Male merfolk have similar growths extending down from their cheekbones.

Merfolk are associated with knowledge, logic, and strategy, though the traditional merfolk creeds express this connection in different ways.

## Creeds
The merfolk race is divided into three creeds, founded on the principles of Emeria (wind), Ula (water), and Cosi (the trickster). A merfolk isn’t born into a creed but chooses it upon reaching adulthood, and it is rare for a merfolk not to choose a creed. Merfolk of the wind and water creeds aren’t hostile to each other, but members of each creed regard the other creed with a vague disdain. Members of both those creeds regard the Cosi creed with suspicion and some degree of fear, and Cosi-creed adherents tend to keep their affiliation secret. Choose one of these creeds for your character.

Some scholars believe that the Merfolk creeds are actually an ancient deviation from the Three-in-One religion of the [Trinitarians](/Religions/Trinitarian.md), split long ago and developed in isolation from one another. Whether this is true is not known, to either Merfolk or the Trinitarians.

### Emeria (Wind) Creed
Merfolk who followed Emeria’s creed seek wisdom and truth in the Wind Realm, exploring the mystical forces—rather than natural causes—behind historical events. They are evasive and intentionally enigmatic in their interactions with others, and are often described as manipulative and deceptive.

* **Cantrip.** You know one cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
