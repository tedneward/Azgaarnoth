# Halflings
There are no halfling "subraces", per se, but halflings will identify closely with the community they call "home", and have widespread communication with other halfling communities within relatively close range. For these reasons, halflings often find themselves engaged by, in, and then become part of, various [Merchant Guilds](/Organizations/MerchantGuilds/MerchantGuilds.md). It also comes as no surprise to anyone that they're quite good at being merchants and guildmasters, particularly when it comes to negotiating.

It is rumored that many halflings are also high-ranking members of various Rogues' Guilds, including some of the most nefarious assassin organizations, but this has never been proven.

Halflings may be [dragonmarked](Dragonmarked.md) with the Mark of Healing or the Mark of Hospitality; see that entry for details.

### Lightfoot and Stout halflings
These halflings are pretty intermixed amongst each other by this point in Azgaarnoth's history, and no non-halfling can tell them apart. Culturally, there is no difference or differentiation between them.

### Ghostwise and Lotusden halflings
Some halflings have independently shown characteristics of these two subraces of halfling, but there appears to be no widespread shared genetic legacy--it seems to randomly appear in various halflings throughout Azgaarnoth. Ghostwise halflings frequently tend to end up associating with some of the psionic-leaning [Mage Schools](/Organizations/MageSchools/MageSchools.md) and Lotusden halflings often wander the wildnerness alongside druids and rangers.

# Halfling Racial Feats

## Bountiful Luck
*Prerequisite: Halfling*

Your people have extraordinary luck, which you have learned to mystically lend to your companions whenever you see them falter. You're not sure how you do it, you just wish it, and it happens. Surely a sign of fortune's favor!

When an ally you can see within 30 feet of you rolls a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to let the ally reroll the die. The ally must use the new roll.

When you use this ability, you can't use your Lucky racial trait before the end of your next turn.

## Second Chance
*Prerequisite: Halfling*

Fortune favors you when someone tries to strike you. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* When a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll. Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t use it again until you roll initiative at the start of combat or until you finish a short or long rest.

### Squat Nimbleness
*Prerequisite: Dwarf or a Small race*

You are uncommonly nimble for your race. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* Increase your walking speed by 5 feet.

* You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill (your choice).

* You have advantage on any Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check you make to escape from being grappled.
