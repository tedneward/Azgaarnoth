# Halves (Half-Elves, Half-Orcs, Half-Dragons)
The "halves" races are always mixed-parent offspring, and as such will frequently find that even within the surprisingly tolerant world of Azgaarnoth, they aren't always trusted completely (deserved or not). Such characters are often searching for a place to call their own, and often find themselves drawn to one side of their legacy over the other.

## Half-Orcs
When alliances between humans and orcs are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.

Half-orcs may be [dragonmarked](Dragonmarked.md) with the Mark of Finding; see that entry for more details.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

* **Age**. Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.

* **Alignment**. Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.

* **Size**. Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

* **Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

* **Darkvision**. Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

## Half-Dragons
Half-Dragons are begotten from the union of a *polymorphed* dragon and some other creature, often a humanoid. As fertile as dragons usually are, half-dragons do not occur particularly often. No record of any half-dragon of metallic dragon parentage have ever been found; the only half-dragons seen have been of chromatic descent, and generally in the close company of members of the [Cult of the Wyrm](/Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md), who consider them blessed and semi-divine. Half-dragons are begotten from the union of a polymorphed dragon and some other creature, often a humanoid (and, given the nature of chromatic dragons, often with evil intent somewhere). There are other methods of creating half-dragons, most of them magical, some of them profane, and all of them known to the [Cult of the Wyrm](/Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md). There are other methods of creating Half-Dragons, most of them magical and some of them profane, and Half-Dragons are just as unique as the methods used to create them.

When they appear, half-dragons are dealt with cautiously at best, and with blunt hostility at worst. Merchants, innkeepers, and other people may be unwilling to speak or deal with you.

As a half-dragon, you look like your draconic parent. You take on the appearance of your parent, including teeth and horns, and you have scales and saurian legs, though you stand upright like any other humanoid.

> Player Note: The first thing to consider about playing a Half-Dragon is "how am I a half-dragon"? Perhaps you were begotten by the union of a red dragon and a human. Perhaps you were cursed by a powerful wizard or deity for some act of hypocrisy. Perhaps you pledged yourself in service to a particular dragon and undertook a ritual to change yourself physically to emulate them. Often this will have some sort of connection to the [Cult of the Wyrm](/Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md) if it is not a story of tragic love or cruel abandonment. Once that is decided, decide the race of your other parent. The most common races are human, elf, and half-elf, though the others are not impossible, including dragonborn or other [Created](Created.md). 
> Then decide your relationship with your parents. Did your draconic mother take you in and raise you as her own? Were you considered an abomination at birth and disowned? Is your draconic father a tyrant who expects you to follow his every command? Did your white dragon mother fall under the sway of love (or perhaps obedience) to a powerful human and feel maternal towards you, offering guidance and assistance? Take into account the dragon's type when determining this. Black dragons tend to be cruel, while a red dragon is simply too prideful to accept you would do anything but his will. Consider how many children your dragon parent has. What is your relationship with your half-siblings? Are they your rivals, or are they your companions and close friends?

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Strength, Constitution, and Charisma scores each increase by 1.

* **Age**. You are expected to live about twice as long as your base (non-draconic) race.

* **Alignment**. A half-dragon's alignment is strongly influenced by its parentage; thus, chromatic half-dragons tend to be evil, but there are anomalies. You may also retain the tendencies of your base race. For example: if your other parent was an elf, you still might be inclined towards chaotic alignments.

* **Size**. Half-dragons are larger than their base race; the size difference usually ranges between a few inches and a foot.

* **Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

* **Draconic Parentage**. You were begotten in some way by a dragon. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Parentage table. Your damage resistance and breath weapon type are determined by your parent, as shown in the table.

  **Draconic Parentage**
  Dragon|Damage Type|Breath Weapon
  ------|-----------|-------------
  Black|Acid|5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
  Blue|Lightning|5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
  Green|Poison|15 ft. cone (Con. save)
  Red|Fire|15 ft. cone (Dex. save)
  White|Cold|15 ft. cone (Con. save)

* **Breath Weapon**. You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic parentage determines the size, shape. and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic parentage. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your
proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save. and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

  After you use your breath weapon, roll a d6 at the beginning of each of your turns. If you roll a 6, your breath weapon recharges and you can use it again. 
  
* **Damage Resistance**. You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic parentage.

* **Senses**. You have blindsight with a radius of 10 feet, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.

* **Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Draconic, in addition to any languages offered by your base race (or that you knew before you were transformed).
