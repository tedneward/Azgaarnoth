# Halves (Half-Elves, Half-Orcs, Half-Dragons)
The "halves" races are always mixed-parent offspring, and as such will frequently find that even within the surprisingly tolerant world of Azgaarnoth, they aren't always trusted completely (whether deserved or not). Such characters are often searching for a place to call their own, and often find themselves drawn to one side of their legacy over the other.
