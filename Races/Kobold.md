# Kobolds

Some of the smallest draconic creatures in the multiverse, kobolds display their draconic ancestry in the glint of their scales and in their roars. While some legends claim kobolds' arrival came with the Hordes, other legends tell of the first kobolds emerging from the Underdark near the lairs of the earliest dragons. Kobolds are often found in service to chromatic dragons--even worshiping them as divine beings--but in recent millennia, as the Hordes have come to understand the benefits of civilization and society, some kobolds chose to take up service with metallic dragons instead. Many have even joined the [Draconic Order](../Organizations/MilitantOrders/DraconicOrder/index.md), and serve as some of their most loyal members.

Whatever their relationship to dragons, kobold scales tend to be rust colored, although the occasional kobold sports a scale color more akin to that of a chromatic or a metallic dragon. A kobold’s cry can express a range of emotion: anger, resolve, elation, fear, and more. Regardless of the emotion expressed, their cry resonates with draconic power, and serve as a sharp reminder that the dragon-blooded are to be respected, regardless of their size.

* **Draconic Cry.** As a bonus action, you let out a cry at your enemies within 10 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn, you and your allies have advantage on attack rolls against any of those enemies who could hear you. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
* **Kobold Legacy.** Kobolds’ connection to dragons can manifest in unpredictable ways in an individual kobold. Choose one of the following legacy options for your kobold:
    * *Craftiness.* You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, Investigation, Medicine, Sleight of Hand, or Survival.
    * *Defiance.* You have advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the frightened condition on yourself.
    * *Draconic Sorcery.* You know one cantrip of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for that cantrip (choose when you select this race).
    * *Ferocity.* You can make unarmed strikes with your tail. When you hit with it, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
