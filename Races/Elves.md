# Elves
Elves stand as the inheritors of the legacy of the Eldar, but owing to their long lifespans and slow reproductive rates, have more or less chosen to surrender this world into the hands of the humans that have slowly come to outnumber them. Elves have long since wandered to every corner of Azgaarnoth, and learned how to adapt to any environment, usually seeking to live in some semblance of harmony with the environment around them, but elves have long since become comfortable with human cities. 

Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

The various subraces of the elves are essentially genetic drift over the thousands of years since their creation by the Eldar. The elves themselves don't see as much difference between themselves in terms of subrace (with a few notable exceptions, in particular the *avariel* and the *maerach* thanks to their physical adaptations), but they are often still drawn to pair off and mate within their subrace simply because of proximity reasons. In most cases, the subraces of the elves stem from the various tasks (and the loose castes that grew out of that) given to them by the Eldar: the bright elves were the close personal servants of the Eldar, much as the high elves were their extended personal staff. The wood elves were those tasked with keeping the natural world in balance, even as the *maerach* were given custodial duties of the seas, the *avariel* the skies, and the *eladrin* ambassadors to the Fey. Some of the elvish subraces emerged after the Fall, notably the *grugach*, who fled back into the wilds to escape the incessant conflict that accompanied the Fall, the *drow* who were supposedly at the heart of the Fall itself, or the *shadar-kai*, who somehow fell under the sway of the Shadowfell in a manner long since lost to history.

Elvish personalities are as diverse as any other race, but owing to their longer lifespan, most elves take a longer view of things and prefer to plan before acting; however, some (like the *eladrin*) embrace the chaotic nature of the world, believing that to try and predict nature is to go against nature. Most elves have a long sense of history and their connection to the world, and many elves know their ancestral history back several generations--which, given their lifespans, can stretch for up to thousands of years. For this reason, elves are often seen as lorekeepers and sources of wisdom and insight, which some use unscrupulously to their advantage.

Elvish alignments span the entire gamut, though certain of the subraces have more marked tendencies in certain directions, as noted below.

Elves generally get along with [humans](Humans.md) and the other Firstborn, owing to their common heritage with the Eldar. They have slightly cooler relationships with many of the Created, though in most cases elves are more prone to judge an individual Created by their actions than to judge the race as a whole. Owing to that history from the Eldar, most elves are generally prejudiced against the races of the Hordes, but the nature of the elves is such that, again, they tend to judge the individual on his/her own merits far more quickly.

Elves may be [dragonmarked](Dragonmarked.md) with the Mark of Shadow; see that entry for details.

The following traits are true of all elves.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

* **Age**. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 25 and can live to be 250 years old.

* **Alignment**. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and are good more often than not. *Drow* are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. *Drow* are more often evil than not.

* **Size**. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

* **Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

* **Darkvision**. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

* **Fey Ancestry**. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

* **Trance**. Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance". While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

* **Keen Senses**. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

* **Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.
