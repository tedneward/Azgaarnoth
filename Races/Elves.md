# Elves
Elves stand as the inheritors of the legacy of the Eldar, but owing to their long lifespans and slow reproductive rates, have more or less chosen to surrender this world into the hands of the humans that have slowly come to outnumber them. Elves have long since wandered to every corner of Azgaarnoth, and learned how to adapt to any environment, usually seeking to live in some semblance of harmony with the environment around them, but elves have long since become comfortable with human cities. 

Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

The various subraces of the elves are essentially genetic drift over the thousands of years since their creation by the Eldar. The elves themselves don't see as much difference between themselves in terms of subrace (with a few notable exceptions, in particular the *avariel* and the *maerach* thanks to their physical adaptations), but they are often still drawn to pair off and mate within their subrace simply because of proximity reasons. In most cases, the subraces of the elves stem from the various tasks (and the loose castes that grew out of that) given to them by the Eldar: the bright elves were the close personal servants of the Eldar, much as the high elves were their extended personal staff. The wood elves were those tasked with keeping the natural world in balance, even as the *maerach* were given custodial duties of the seas, the *avariel* the skies, and the *eladrin* ambassadors to the Fey. Some of the elvish subraces emerged after the Fall, notably the *grugach*, who fled back into the wilds to escape the incessant conflict that accompanied the Fall, the *drow* who were supposedly at the heart of the Fall itself, or the *shadar-kai*, who somehow fell under the sway of the Shadowfell in a manner long since lost to history.

Elvish personalities are as diverse as any other race, but owing to their longer lifespan, most elves take a longer view of things and prefer to plan before acting; however, some (like the *eladrin*) embrace the chaotic nature of the world, believing that to try and predict nature is to go against nature. Most elves have a long sense of history and their connection to the world, and many elves know their ancestral history back several generations--which, given their lifespans, can stretch for up to thousands of years. For this reason, elves are often seen as lorekeepers and sources of wisdom and insight, which some use unscrupulously to their advantage.

Elvish alignments span the entire gamut, though certain of the subraces have more marked tendencies in certain directions, as noted below.

Elves generally get along with [humans](Humans.md) and the other [Firstborn](Firstborn.md), owing to their common heritage with the Eldar. They have slightly cooler relationships with many of the [Created](Created.md), though in most cases elves are more prone to judge an individual Created by their actions than to judge the race as a whole. Owing to that history from the Eldar, most elves are generally prejudiced against the races of the [Hordes](Hordes.md), but the nature of the elves is such that, again, they tend to judge the individual on his/her own merits far more quickly.

Elves may be [dragonmarked](Dragonmarked.md) with the Mark of Shadow; see that entry for details.

The following traits are true of all elves.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

* **Age**. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 25 and can live to be 250 years old.

* **Alignment**. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and are good more often than not. *Drow* are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. *Drow* are more often evil than not.

* **Size**. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

* **Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

* **Darkvision**. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

* **Fey Ancestry**. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

* **Trance**. Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance". While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

* **Keen Senses**. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

* **Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.


## Bright Elf
The bright elves are one of the oldest and rarest subraces of elves, and thanks to their long years of close association with the Eldar they have an innate connection to the celestial light and song of creation. They are more lawful than other elven societies, and they value obedience as well as conformity. Many bright elves believe themselves to be the purest and most original form of elf, and see other elven subraces as little better than non-elves, but others among their ranks  are more accepting, often chiding their haughtier peers and worrying that such thinking is what led to the Fall.

As a bright elf, your body and soul are infused with light. A bright elf's skin is bronze, silvery, pearly, or pale white, and their hair is golden blond, platinum blond, or silvery white. Their eyes are usually golden or silvery gray, with streaks of white radiating from their pupils like a starburst.

* **Ability Score Increase.** One ability score of your choice other than Dexterity increases by 1.

* **Ancient Magic.** Choose one of the following cantrips: [light](), [dancing lights](), or [thaumaturgy](). You know that cantrip, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

* **Brightfolk.** You have resistance to radiant damage, and you have advantage on saving throws to resist being blinded by effects that deal radiant damage or create light.

* **Celestial Nature.** You have two creature types: humanoid and celestial You can be affected by a game effect if it works on either of your creature types.


## High Elf
High elves and wood elves are, by this point in Azgaarnoth's history, fairly well intermixed and are found in most locations all across Azgaarnoth; at this point in their evolution, no non-elf can tell the difference between them.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

* **Cantrip**. You know one cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

* **Elf Weapon Training**. You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

* **Extra Language**. You can read, speak, and write one additional language of your choice.


## Wood Elf
Wood elves and high elves are, by this point in Azgaarnoth's history, fairly well intermixed and are found in most locations all across Azgaarnoth; at this point in their evolution, no non-elf can tell the difference between them.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

* **Elf Weapon Training**. You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

* **Fleet of Foot**. Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.

* **Mask of the Wild**. You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.


## Fey Elves (*eladrin*)
The *eladrin* are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic.  They are most often found in the wilds of [North Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md), or on any of the scattered islands around Azgaarnoth. Intriguingly, they are also commonly found in the lands of the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md), without being forced into extensive combat against their neighbors.

An *eladrin* is associated with one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the *eladrin*'s mood:

* **Autumn** is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all. Your skin takes on a darker-brownish hue, and your hair tends to take on more of a darker orange or even brown.
* **Winter** is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers. Your skin fades in color, taking on whitish tones, even to the point of albinism depending on how deep the contemplation you feel, and your hair tends to mirror that.
* **Spring** is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes. Your hair will often erupt into a bold color hue, such as red, green, or even blue, and your skin will often take on a greenish tinge.
* **Summer** is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy. Your hair will turn fire-red or blonde, and your skin may take on a bronze color.

Some *eladrin* remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Charisma score increases by 1.

* **Fey Step**. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
  When you reach 3rd level, your Fey Step gains an additional effect based on your season; if the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. The effects are as follows:

  * **Autumn**. Immediately after you use your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to it.
  * **Winter**. When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
  * **Spring**. When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.
  * **Summer**. Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).

  When finishing a long rest, any *eladrin* can change their season. An *eladrin* might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the *eladrin*'s current emotional state. For example, an *eladrin* might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another *eladrin* could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an *eladrin* of spring, and fury might cause an *eladrin* to change to summer.


## Winged Elves (*avariel*)
The *avariel* are winged elves. If the *avariel* are still present on Azgaarnoth, they do an excellent job keeping themselves hidden from common sight. Nevertheless, the *avariel* were some of the first elves created as part of the Eldars' Firstborn, and many were tasked with supporting and pairing with the dragons that partnered with the Eldar. Legend held that they often lived in great aeyries in the highest mountains.

The *avariel* are generally lighter in stature and size, often up to a full foot shorter than the average high or wood elf, and much lither of form. Their wings can be folded to curl up close to their backs, which if covered with clothing, could allow them to pass for another form of elf, though not under any sort of detailed scrutiny. (Most *avariel* don't like hiding their wings anyway, feeling it to be constricting and claustrophobic.) Generally they wear light clothing, though when flying at high altitudes will wrap themselves in furs or other insulating clothing to help with the chill of the high altitudes.

Scholars who have (supposedly) studied the *avariel* have reported a general disinterest in the world of mortals, preferring a lifestyle that brings them higher and higher in the air, coming to the ground only when they must. Reportedly some *avariel* over the centuries have grown curious about "grounders" and the "world below", however, and journey among the rest of the mortals on the surface of Azgaarnoth, though whether this is by choice or some form of ostracization is never clear. Lombok Ganjuseri, High Scholar of the [Silent Tower](/Organizations/MageSchools/SilentTower.md), published what is thought to be the definitive work on the *avariel*, in which he described the *avariel* as extremely "quick" with their emotions--quick to embrace, quick to leave, quick to love, and quick to abandon--but critics point out that his experience was with just a mated pair of the *avariel*, and that given Lombok's somewhat off-putting nature, their responses to him may have been more personal than racial.

* **Flight**. You have a flying speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor.

* **Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Auran.



## Wild Elves (*grugach*)
The *grugach* are those elves that sought to escape the world into the wilds, and for the most part, they reside almost exclusively in [North Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md) in the wilderness far from any civilization. Periodically, a young *grugach* will seek a different path, and venture into civilization, and these often make fierce scouts or rangers, either in partnership with druids or working on behalf of a [Mercenary Company](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md), particularly in the incessant battles on [Chidia](/Geography/Chidia.md). *Grugach* look almost identical to any other elves, and so will generally not raise an eyebrow when seen on the street or on board a ship. Other elves will note the subtle differences that mark the *grugach*, however, particularly after some close contact.

Many scholars have suggested that the *grugach* are a "devolved" form of the elves, reduced to "spears and loincloths" because they have eschewed civilization, but those who have met and walked among the *grugach* tell a very different story: the *grugach* are as fully sophisticated as any Lirian city in their society and abstract thought, choosing their simpler way of life as a way to better commune with nature and distance themselves from the pain and horror that often accompanies civilized life. Their "spears and loincloths" (which actually don't do justice to the painstakingly beautiful wooden weapons the *grugach* produce, which often are as hard and as sharp as steel or even mithral) are emblematic of their desire to operate in conjunction with nature, not subjugate it. As with most elves, they revere beauty, but see just as much beauty in the tangle of brush or the patterns of the hunt as they do music or art.

Contrary to popular belief, *grugach* do not kidnap children to live with them in the woods, and will often be wary but welcoming of visitors to their realms. A visitor who is lost in a *grugach* realm will be approached by a solitary hunter (though others will lurk, unseen, in the woods surrounding to provide aid and support should that be necessary), and the *grugach* will render aid, directions, or even provide food or shelter should the lost wanderer require it. To be invited into a *grugach* realm requires a much deeper level of trust, however, and usually is reserved only for those who demonstrate strong reverence for nature and the Balance. Rangers and druids almost always earn this trust, while other classes may have to work harder at it.

If anyone is fool enough to disturb a *grugach* realm, these elves take to arms and fight in earnest. *Grugach* master the basic weapons needed to hunt and forage in the wood, and are masters with them. Every copse of trees becomes a sniper’s nest, and each forest meadow is an ambush point. The *grugach* set pits filled with stakes, snares that leave an intruder helpless to *grugach* arrows, and other snares designed to kill rather than capture. Their arcane arts call the power of nature to their hands, and their divine connections with the Pantheonic dieties of nature visit harsh reprisal on those foolish enough to underestimate the *grugach's* ability to destroy their enemies. The *grugach* fight to the death to preserve their realms.

*Grugach* are generally neutral in ethos, seeing that nature is neither good nor evil in its own right. In fact, some of the older *grugach* believe that good and evil are concepts born of civilization, and most closely associate with the Balance and the Great Circle espoused by [Druidism](/Religions/Druidism.md).

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Strength score increases by 1.

* ***Grugach* Weapon Training**. You have proficiency with the spear, shortbow, longbow, and net.

* **Cantrip**. You know one cantrip of your choice from the druid spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.

* **Languages**. Unlike other elves, you don’t speak, read, or write Common. You instead speak, read, and write Sylvan.



## Sea Elves (*maerach*)
The *maerach* are those elves that chose the oceans and seas as their home, and with Eldar assistance, came to own them as any other elf does their woods. The *maerach* discovered, however, that like the lands they had left, the seas were also home to numerous creatures that sought mastery and domination. *Maerach* have found themselves in conflict with these creatures of the [Undersea](Undersea.md) ever since. Fortunately, the *maerach* retain their ability to breathe air, and have often aided surface mortals against the creatures of the Undersea in exchange for knowledge, tactics, and sometimes even mercenary help. Individual *maerach* are sometimes dispatched to the surface to learn of events there, carry messages, and create friendships, and a few port cities are even called "home" to some *maerach* who find the surface interesting. *Maerach* look strikingly similar to elves, aside from a small set of gills set just below their ears, which long hair (worn loosely) can usually hide.

*Maerach* are a strongly matrilineal society, with family names associated with the birth mother of the elf involved. Families are more "pod"-like in nature, and family bonds are often more fluid than is found in other elvish societies--it is not uncommon to see a *maerach* family pod that consists of multiple adults raising multiple children. Adults in the "pod" are generally loyal to their family, though family disputes often do see a pod member kicked out of the pod (often temporarily, but sometimes permanently), which can lead to *maerach* journeying "abovewater" for a while.

While some *maerach* have settled "abovewater" for long periods of time, most *maerach* consider the sea their homes, and will generally not want to settle anywhere more than a day's walk or ride away from the ocean. (For whatever reason, *maerach* do not consider interior lakes or rivers to be "proper sea"; discussions on the subject usually end quickly as the *maerach* changes the subject.) As a result, any concentration of *maerach* is inevitably in a port city or town, and *maerach* are often engaged "abovewater" in maritime activities--sailors, shipbuilders, or even fishers.

Whether *maerach* have cities in the Undersea is a hotly-debated topic among the non-*maerach*, and one that *maerach* refuse to discuss, even at point of torture.

*Maerach* generally have very good relationships with [tortles](Tortles.md) and [tritons](Tritons.md), but are highly prejudiced against [lizardfolk](Lizardfolk.md), at least at first. Like all elves, *maerach* tend to judge individuals based on their actions as they observe them, but it is not uncommon to see *maerach* loosen weapons at first sight of lizardfolk, or be surprised in combat by devious tortles or tritons.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Constitution score increases by 1.

* **Sea Elf Training**. You have proficiency with the spear, trident, light crossbow, and net.

* **Child of the Sea**. You have a swimming speed of 30 feet, and you can breathe air and water.

* **Friend of the Sea**. Using gestures and sounds, you can communicate simple ideas with any beast that has an innate swimming speed.

* **Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Aquan.



## Shadow Elves (*shadar-kai*)
These elves remain a mystery even to their kin--their origins are lost, their homes are undiscovered, and their motives and allegiances are absolutely indiscernible. Individual *shadar-kai* have been seen wandering the world, identifiable more by their piercings and tatoos than anything else, leaving many to wonder if other *shadar-kai*, unpierced and untattooed, also wander the world--and why.

*Eladrin* and *shadar-kai* are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Constitution score increases by 1.

* **Necrotic Resistance**. You have resistance to necrotic damage.

* **Blessing of the Raven Queen**. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.



## Dark Elf (*drow*)
Elvish scholars speak of an ancient schism amongst the Eldar--and some insist that this was the start of the Fall--that prompted an offshoot of the Eldar to take refuge underground. Rumors hold that these dark elves are the reason (somehow) Mt Bezulb continues to erupt consistently. Note that despite numerous claims to the contrary, *drow* and *shadar-kai* are not the same race, and in fact they seem to have an inborn implacable hatred of one another that defies explanation.

Most *drow* seem to hail from the Daw Mountains near the only active volcano in Azgaarnoth, Mt Bezulb.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Charisma score increases by 1.

* ***Drow* Magic**. You know the [dancing lights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dancing-lights) cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast Faerie Fire once, and it recharges after a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast Darkness once, and it recharges after a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

* ***Drow* Weapon Training**. You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.

* **Superior Darkvision**. Your darkvision has a range of 120 feet, instead of 60.

* **Sunlight Sensitivity**. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of the attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.
