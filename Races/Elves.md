# Elves

Elves may be [dragonmarked](Dragonmarked.md) with the Mark of Shadow; see that entry for details.

The following traits are true of all elves.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

* **Age**. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 25 and can live to be 250 years old.

* **Alignment**. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and are good more often than not. Drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.

* **Size**. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

* **Speed**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

* **Darkvision**. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

* **Fey Ancestry**. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

* **Trance**. Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance". While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

* **Keen Senses**. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

* **Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.

## Wood Elf
High elves and wood elves are, by this point in Azgaarnoth's history, fairly well intermixed and are found in most locations where elves are found; no non-elf can tel the difference between them.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and protected by your people. You learn one druid cantrip of your choice. You also learn the [longstrider]() and [pass without trace]() spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.


## Eladrin
Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic.  They are most often found in the wilds of [North Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md), or on any of the scattered islands around Azgaarnoth. Intriguingly, they are also commonly found in the lands of the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md), without being forced into extensive combat against their neighbors.

An eladrin is associated with one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin's mood:

* **Autumn** is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all.
* **Winter** is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.
* **Spring** is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes.
* **Summer** is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.

Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Charisma score increases by 1.

* **Fey Step**. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
  When you reach 3rd level, your Fey Step gains an additional effect based on your season; if the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. The effects are as follows:

  * **Autumn**. Immediately after you use your Fey Step, up to two creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute, or until you or your companions deal any damage to it.
  * **Winter**. When you use your Fey Step, one creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you before you teleport must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
  * **Spring**. When you use your Fey Step, you can touch one willing creature within 5 feet of you. That creature then teleports instead of you, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you.
  * **Summer**. Immediately after you use your Fey Step, each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage).

  When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin's current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.




## Avariel ("Winged Elves")
The avariel are winged elves. If the avariel are still present on Azgaarnoth, they do an excellent job keeping themselves hidden from common sight. Nevertheless, the avariel were some of the first elves created as part of the Eldars' Firstborn, and many were tasked with supporting and pairing with the dragons that partnered with the Eldar. Legend held that they often lived in great aeyries in the highest mountains.

* **Flight**. You have a flying speed of 30 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor.

* **Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Auran.


## Grugach ("Wild Elves")
The grugach are those elves that sought to escape the world into the wilds, and for the most part, they reside almost exclusively in [North Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md) in the wilderness far from any civilization. Periodically, a young grugach will seek a different path, and venture into civilization, and these often make fierce scouts or rangers, either in partnership with druids or working on behalf of a [Mercenary Company](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md), particularly in the incessant battles on [Chidia](/Geography/Chidia.md). Grugach look almost identical to any other elves, and so will generally not raise an eyebrow when seen.

If anyone is fool enough to disturb a grugach realm, these elves take to arms and fight in earnest. Grugach master the basic weapons needed to hunt and forage in the wood. Every copse of trees becomes a sniper’s nest, and each forest meadow is an ambush point. The grugach set pits filled with stakes, snares that leave an intruder helpless to grugach arrows, and other snares designed to kill rather than capture. The grugach fight to the death to preserve their realms.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Strength score increases by 1.

* **Grugach Weapon Training**. You have proficiency with the spear, shortbow, longbow, and net.

* **Cantrip**. You know one cantrip of your choice from the druid spell list. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.

* **Languages**. Unlike other elves, you don’t speak, read, or write Common. You instead speak, read, and write Sylvan.

## Maerach ("Sea Elves")
The maerach are those elves that chose the oceans and seas as their home, and with Eldar assistance, came to own them as any other elf does their woods. The maerach discovered, however, that like the lands they had left, the seas were also home to numerous creatures that sought mastery and domination. Maerach have found themselves in conflict with these creatures of the Undersea ever since. Fortunately, the maerach retain their ability to breath air, and have often aided surface mortals against the creatures of the Undersea in exchange for knowledge, tactics, and sometimes even mercenary help. Individual maerach are sometimes dispatched to the surface to learn of events there, carry messages, and create friendships, and a few port cities are even called "home" to some maerach who find the surface interesting. Maerach look strikingly similar to elves, aside from a small set of gills set just below their ears, which long hair (worn loosely) can usually hide.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Constitution score increases by 1.

* **Sea Elf Training**. You have proficiency with the spear, trident, light crossbow, and net.

* **Child of the Sea**. You have a swimming speed of 30 feet, and you can breathe air and water.

* **Friend of the Sea**. Using gestures and sounds, you can communicate simple ideas with any beast that has an innate swimming speed.

* **Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Aquan.


## Shadar-kai ("Shadow Elves")
These elves remain a mystery even to their kin--their origins are lost, their homes are undiscovered, and their motives and allegiances are absolutely indiscernible. Individual shadar-kai have been seen wandering the world, identifiable more by their piercings and tatoos than anything else, leaving many to wonder if other shadar-kai, unpierced and untattooed, also wander the world--and why.

Eladrin and shadar-kai are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Constitution score increases by 1.

* **Necrotic Resistance**. You have resistance to necrotic damage.

* **Blessing of the Raven Queen**. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.


## Drow (Dark Elf)
Elvish scholars speak of an ancient schism amongst the Eldar--and some insist that this was the start of the Fall--that prompted an offshoot of the Eldar to take refuge underground. Rumors hold that these dark elves are the reason (somehow) Mt Bezulb continues to erupt consistently. Note that despite numerous claims to the contrary, drow and shadar-kai are not the same race, and in fact they seem to have an inborn implacable hatred of one another that defies explanation.

Most drow seem to hail from the Daw Mountains near the only active volcano in Azgaarnoth, Mt Bezulb.

* **Ability Score Increase**. Your Charisma score increases by 1.

* **Drow Magic**. You know the [dancing lights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dancing-lights) cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast Faerie Fire once, and it recharges after a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast Darkness once, and it recharges after a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

* **Drow Weapon Training**. You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.

* **Superior Darkvision**. Your darkvision has a range of 120 feet, instead of 60.

* **Sunlight Sensitivity**. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of the attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

### Drow Racial Feats
*Prerequisite: Elf (drow)*

You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the detect magic spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn levitate and dispel magic, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast the spell in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
