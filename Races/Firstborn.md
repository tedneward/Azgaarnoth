# Firstborn
These are called such because they are those born of the [Eldar](Eldar.md) themselves, or so it is thought. Broadly speaking, these are the elves and dwarves and their respective offshoots. They all tend to live much longer than [humans](Humans.md), but also reproduce much more slowly.

## [Elves](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/elf)
Elves stand as the inheritors of the legacy of the Eldar, but owing to their long lifespans and slow reproductive rates, have more or less chosen to surrender this world into the hands of the humans that have slowly come to outnumber them. Elves have long since wandered to every corner of Azgaarnoth, and learned how to adapt to any environment, usually seeking to live in some semblance of harmony with the environment around them, but elves have long since become comfortable with human cities. Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

### High Elf

### [Half-Elves](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/half-elf)
Half-elves (children of humand elvish parentage) are somewhat common across Azgaarnoth, and adapt quite well to almost any society.

### Eladrin
(from [*UA: EladrinGith*](/Supplements/UA-Eladrin-Gith.pdf))
Eladrin are most often found in the wilds of [North Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md), or on any of the scattered islands around Azgaarnoth. Intriguingly, they are also commonly found in the lands of the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md), without being forced into extensive combat against their neighbors.

### Gith (Githyanki, Githzerai)
(from [*UA: EladrinGith*](/Supplements/UA-Eladrin-Gith.pdf))
(also from *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*)
Within Azgaarnoth, gith are thought to be elves captured by the illithids very early in the days of the [Eldar](/Races/Eldar.md) and never rescued. Once secured, the illithids examined their captive elves (and dwarves, see below), and then subsequently genetically or behaviorally altered them into their current form. By the time the gith staged their successful rebellion against their illithid masters, the connection between elf and gith had long been lost to history, but genetically the two races seem to recognize one another. For whatever reason, both githyanki and githzerai trod carefully around elves, preferring to be cautious around one another, particularly githzerai and elves. It is rumored that the [Dread Emperor](/People/DreadEmperor.md) has sought an alliance with the githyanki for centuries; rumors also contend that the [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md) has made a deal with the githzerai: a secret safe monastery within Azgaarnoth (to train both young githzerai as well as promising mortal monks), in exchange for information and/or introductions to "psionic dragons". The reasons for the Order's interest in these dragons, if true, are fairly obvious.

### Avariel ("Winged Elves")
(from [*UA: ElfSubraces*](/Supplements/UA-ElfSubraces.pdf))
If the avariel are present on Azgaarnoth, they do an excellent job keeping themselves hidden from common sight. Nevertheless, the avariel were some of the first elves created as part of the Eldars' Firstborn, and many were tasked with supporting and pairing with the dragons that partnered with the Eldar. Legend held that they often lived in great aeyries in the highest mountains.

### Grugach ("Wild Elves")
(from [*UA: ElfSubraces*](/Supplements/UA-ElfSubraces.pdf))
The grugach are those elves that sought to escape the world into the wilds, and for the most part, they reside almost exclusively in [North Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md) in the wilderness far from any civilization. Periodically, a young grugach will seek a different path, and venture into civilization, and these often make fierce scouts or rangers, either in partnership with druids or working on behalf of a [Mercenary Company](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md), particularly in the incessant battles on [Chidia](/Geography/Chidia.md). Grugach look almost identical to any other elves, and so will generally not raise an eyebrow when seen.

### Maerach ("Sea Elves")
(from [*UA: ElfSubraces*](/Supplements/UA-ElfSubraces.pdf))
The maerach are those elves that chose the oceans and seas as their home, and with Eldar assistance, came to own them as any other elf does their woods. The maerach discovered, however, that like the lands they had left, the seas were also home to numerous creatures that sought mastery and domination. Maerach have found themselves in conflict with these creatures of the Undersea ever since. Fortunately, the maerach retain their ability to breath air, and have often aided surface mortals against the creatures of the Undersea in exchange for knowledge, tactics, and sometimes even mercenary help. Individual maerach are sometimes dispatched to the surface to learn of events there, carry messages, and create friendships, and a few port cities are even called "home" to some maerach who find the surface interesting. Maerach look strikingly similar to elves, aside from a small set of gills set just below their ears, which long hair (worn loosely) can usually hide.

### Shadar-kai ("Shadow Elves")
(from [*UA: ElfSubraces*](/Supplements/UA-ElfSubraces.pdf))
These elves remain a mystery even to their kin--their origins are lost, their homes are undiscovered, and their motives and allegiances are absolutely indiscernible. Individual shadar-kai have been seen wandering the world, identifiable more by their piercings and tatoos than anything else, leaving many to wonder if other shadar-kai, unpierced and untattooed, also wander the world--and why.

### Drow (Dark Elf)
Elvish scholars speak of an ancient schism amongst the Eldar--and some insist that this was the start of the Fall--that prompted an offshoot of the Eldar to take refuge underground. Rumors hold that these dark elves are the reason (somehow) Mt Bezulb continues to erupt consistently. Note that despite numerous claims to the contrary, drow and shadar-kai are not the same race, and in fact they seem to have an inborn implacable hatred of one another that defies explanation.

Most drow seem to hail from the Daw Mountains near the only active volcano in Azgaarnoth, Mt Bezulb.


## [Dwarves](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/dwarf)
Dwarves, for the most part, have found, after the Exodus and several attempted Returns, that they care less about governance and governments as they do mining, craftwork, and trade. The ancient dwarvish clan gave rise to the modern merchant guild, and today most dwarvish clans are organized as merchant guilds (rather than kingdoms), giving them access across national boundaries. This suits the dwarves fine, who for the most part eschew the politics that have kept Liria and its neighbors embroiled for many years. Individual dwarves are welcome in mercenary companies, militant orders, and religious halls, particularly those who have either left or been cast out of clan-and-guild, but returns to clan-and-guild after a long career are commonplace, particularly if the returning dwarf brings opportunities for trade. Dwarves have reached a point where the sense of "clan" is built around the guild, and dwarves choosing to leave one guild to join another are not uncommon; for the modern dwarf, guild ties are stronger than familial ties in most cases.

### Hill dwarf and Mountain dwarf
These are essentially small genetic differences within the dwarven bloodline, but at this point in Azgaarnoth's history they are essentially meaningless as cultural differentiators--hill dwarves often work in the mountains as part of their guild/clan, and mountain dwarves are often found in hills for similar reasons. In fact, it's more common to see them in cities than in hills or mountains. Most non-dwarves can't even tell the difference between them.

### Dark dwarves (duergar) ("Underdark dwarf")
Rumors persist of clans of dwarves that never participated as part of the Exodus (or were left behind either accidentally or deliberately, depending on the rumor), and were forced into hard living and driven deeper into the depths to survive. Some theorize that these clans were actually captured by the illithid (mind flayers) at the same time elves were captured. Whether these "dark dwarves" are myth or real has yet to be substantiated in any credible form. These rumors generally also tie into the rumors of tunnels that connect the western and eastern reaches of the Daw mountain range underneath the Ravensound, as such tunnels would provide adequate depth to hide them from the Hordes that precipitated the Exodus.

## [Gnomes](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/gnome)
Thought to be an ancient offshoot of the dwarves, gnomes have long since forged their own culture and racial identity. What is known is that by the time of the Exodus, gnomes were a separate and identifiable race, and gnomish tribes fought and fled alongside dwarvish clans, implying a deep degree of societal interactivity, if not a shared genetic legacy.
 
Gnomes, like dwarves, have taken to the merchant guilds, but still maintain strong familial ties. A gnome is often welcome in a dwarvish merchant guild, but dwarves will never completely understand why gnomes feel bound to continue to maintain connections with family outside the guild; conversely, gnomes never quite understand how dwarves can abandon kin so quickly in the name of profit or trade.

### Rock gnomes
(from *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*)
Rock gnomes are often found in the Daw Range, but also within the many hillsides that litter the continent. Surprisingly larger numbers of rock gnome settlements are found on the Al'Uma/Yithi side of the Daws, but this may be simply coincidence. Rock gnomes in Azgaarnoth are not quite as inventive as Mordenkainen posits, but the trait is found in many, and for this reason rock gnomes are often drawn to the [Order of the Steel Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Steel.md) and some of the larger [Merchant Guilds](/Organization/MerchantGuilds/MerchantGuilds.md), particularly the Alchemists' Guilds.

### Forest gnomes
Forest gnome villages are found in almost every wooded area on Azgaarnoth--if you can find them. Individual forest gnomes are not common, yet they are not so rare as to draw immediate attention when they wander into town. Many of the forest gnomes have spent time with the [Glittering Eye](/Organizations/MageSchoools/GlitteringEye.md) mage school, to perfect their illusions, and often work closely with druids to maintain their forest home when threatened.

### Svirfneblin ("deep gnomes")
Svirfneblin enclaves are buried deep within the Daws Range and, like the rest of the Underdark, miles below the surface of the other continents of Azgaarnoth. Most svirfneblin never see the light of day, and most have been in a desperate struggle for survival for too long to have the gnomish "love of life" and curiosity that characterize their surface kin.

### Dark gnomes
Like the dwarves and the elves, rumors abound of "dark gnomes" that live deep within the earth, but rumors cannot decide if these gnomes are abandoned Exodus tribes or tribes that never integrated with the dwarves to begin with.


## [Halflings](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/halfling)
The genetic legacy of halflings is entirely unknown--scholars theorize that these are ancient half-human, half-dwarf breeds that have evolved into their own genetic trunk, and said scholars support this with the fact that while humans and halflings can have children, and halflings and dwarves can have children, humans and dwarves seem incapable of conception. Halflings are mentioned nowhere in the slim records of the Exodus, which also gives credence to this theory. Counterarguments suggest that halflings were an offshoot of dwarves that predate the Exodus and adapted more quickly to life on the surface, and thus were not mentioned in Exodus records because they had long since conducted their own, quieter, exodus. For the most part, halflings are content to leave the history a mystery, and choose instead to focus on the now. Regardless of their origins, halflings maintain the "luck" factor that has served them so well in other planes of existence, and may well explain why halfling history is missing so many of the tragedies that have befallen other races.
 
Halflings are generally tied closely to their communities, and while communities are often built around a small collection of large family structures, it's not unknown for halflings to feel cramped by the community in which they were raised, go out on their own, and either create a new halfling community or adopt into one. Halflings are generally quite social, enjoy the company of any of the other races, and fiercely defensive of their communities (both historical and adoptive).

There are no halfling "subraces", per se, but halflings will identify closely with the community they call "home", and have widespread communication with other halfling communities within relatively close range. For these reasons, halflings often find themselves engaged by, in, and then become part of, various [Merchant Guilds](/Organizations/MerchantGuilds/MerchantGuilds.md). It also comes as no surprise to anyone that they're quite good at being merchants and guildmasters, particularly when it comes to negotiating.

It is rumored that many halflings are also high-ranking members of various Rogues' Guilds, including some of the most nefarious assassin organizations, but this has never been proven.

### Lightfoot and Stout halflings
These halflings are pretty intermixed amongst each other by this point in Azgaarnoth's history, and no non-halfling can tell them apart. Culturally, there is no difference or differentiation between them.

### Ghostwise and Lotusden halflings
Some halflings have independently shown characteristics of these two subraces of halfling, but there appears to be no widespread shared genetic legacy--it seems to randomly appear in various halflings throughout Azgaarnoth. Ghostwise halflings frequently tend to end up associating with some of the psionic-leaning [Mage Schools](/Organizations/MageSchools/MageSchools.md) and Lotusden halflings often wander the wildnerness alongside druids and rangers.
