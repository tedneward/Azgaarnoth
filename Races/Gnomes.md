# Gnomes

### Rock gnomes
(from *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*)
Rock gnomes are often found in the Daw Range, but also within the many hillsides that litter the continent. Surprisingly larger numbers of rock gnome settlements are found on the Al'Uma/Yithi side of the Daws, but this may be simply coincidence. Rock gnomes in Azgaarnoth are not quite as inventive as Mordenkainen posits, but the trait is found in many, and for this reason rock gnomes are often drawn to the [Order of the Steel Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Steel.md) and some of the larger [Merchant Guilds](/Organization/MerchantGuilds/MerchantGuilds.md), particularly the Alchemists' Guilds.

### Forest gnomes
Forest gnome villages are found in almost every wooded area on Azgaarnoth--if you can find them. Individual forest gnomes are not common, yet they are not so rare as to draw immediate attention when they wander into town. Many of the forest gnomes have spent time with the [Glittering Eye](/Organizations/MageSchoools/GlitteringEye.md) mage school, to perfect their illusions, and often work closely with druids to maintain their forest home when threatened.

### Svirfneblin ("deep gnomes")
Svirfneblin enclaves are buried deep within the Daws Range and, like the rest of the Underdark, miles below the surface of the other continents of Azgaarnoth. Most svirfneblin never see the light of day, and most have been in a desperate struggle for survival for too long to have the gnomish "love of life" and curiosity that characterize their surface kin.

### Dark gnomes
Like the dwarves and the elves, rumors abound of "dark gnomes" that live deep within the earth, but rumors cannot decide if these gnomes are abandoned Exodus tribes or tribes that never integrated with the dwarves to begin with.
