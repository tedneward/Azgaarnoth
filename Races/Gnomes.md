# Gnomes

Gnomes may be [dragonmarked](Dragonmarked.md) with the Mark of Scribing; see that entry for details.

## Gnomish Racial Feats

### Fade Away
*Prerequisite: Gnome*

Your people are clever, with a knack for illusion magic. You have learned a magical trick for fading away when you suffer harm. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* Immediately after you take damage, you can use a reaction to magically become invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Squat Nimbleness
*Prerequisite: Dwarf or a Small race*

You are uncommonly nimble for your race. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* Increase your walking speed by 5 feet.

* You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill (your choice).

* You have advantage on any Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check you make to escape from being grappled.

### Rock gnomes
(from *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*)
Rock gnomes are often found in the Daw Range, but also within the many hillsides that litter the continent. Surprisingly larger numbers of rock gnome settlements are found on the Al'Uma/Yithi side of the Daws, but this may be simply coincidence. Rock gnomes in Azgaarnoth are not quite as inventive as Mordenkainen posits, but the trait is found in many, and for this reason rock gnomes are often drawn to the [Order of the Steel Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Steel.md) and some of the larger [Merchant Guilds](/Organization/MerchantGuilds/MerchantGuilds.md), particularly the Alchemists' Guilds.

#### Rock gnome racial feat: Wonder Maker
*Prerequisite: Gnome (rock)*

You master the tinker techniques of your people. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* When you make a check using your proficiency with tinker’s tools, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check.

* When you make a device with your Tinker trait, you have the following additional options for what you make:

  * **Alarm**: This device senses when a creature moves to within 15 feet of it without speaking aloud a password chosen when you create it. One round after a creature moves into range, the alarm makes a shrill ringing that lasts for 1 minute and can be heard from up to 300 feet away.

  * **Calculator**: This device makes doing sums easy.

  * **Lifter**: This device can be used as a block and tackle, allowing its user to hoist five times the weight the user can normally lift.

  * **Timekeeper**: This pocket watch keeps accurate time.

  * **Weather Sensor**: When used as an action, this device predicts weather conditions in a 1-mile radius over the next 4 hours, showing one symbol (clouds, sun/moon, rain, or snow) for each hour

### Forest gnomes
Forest gnome villages are found in almost every wooded area on Azgaarnoth--if you can find them. Individual forest gnomes are not common, yet they are not so rare as to draw immediate attention when they wander into town. Many of the forest gnomes have spent time with the [Glittering Eye](/Organizations/MageSchoools/GlitteringEye.md) mage school, to perfect their illusions, and often work closely with druids to maintain their forest home when threatened.

#### Forest gnome racial feat
*Prerequisite: Gnome (forest)*

Your friendship with animals mystically deepens. You gain the following benefits:

* You gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. If you’re already proficient in it, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with it.

* You learn the [speak with animals]() spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn the [animal friendship]() spell, and you can cast it once with this feat, without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Svirfneblin ("deep gnomes")
Svirfneblin enclaves are buried deep within the Daws Range and, like the rest of the Underdark, miles below the surface of the other continents of Azgaarnoth. Most svirfneblin never see the light of day, and most have been in a desperate struggle for survival for too long to have the gnomish "love of life" and curiosity that characterize their surface kin.

#### Svirfneblin Racial Feat: Svirfneblin Magic
*Prerequisite: Gnome (deep gnome)*

You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast Nondetection on yourself at will, without needing a material component.

You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: Blindness/Deafness, Blur, and Disguise Self. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Dark gnomes
Like the dwarves and the elves, rumors abound of "dark gnomes" that live deep within the earth, but rumors cannot decide if these gnomes are abandoned Exodus tribes or tribes that never integrated with the dwarves to begin with.
