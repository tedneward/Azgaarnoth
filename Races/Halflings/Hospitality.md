# Mark of Hospitality
They may not always have gold, but a halfling with the Mark of Hospitality is sure to be rich in friends. The magic of the mark allows the bearer to keep a place clean, and to heat, chill, and season food. But it also helps the bearer connect with others, setting troubled minds at ease—a powerful tool, though it can cause anger if abused.
