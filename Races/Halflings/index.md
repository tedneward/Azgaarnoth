# Halflings
There are no halfling "subraces", per se, but halflings will identify closely with the community they call "home", and have widespread communication with other halfling communities within relatively close range. For these reasons, halflings often find themselves engaged by, in, and then become part of, various [Merchant Guilds](../Organizations/MerchantGuilds/index.md). It also comes as no surprise to anyone that they're quite good at being merchants and guildmasters, particularly when it comes to negotiating.

It is rumored that many halflings are also high-ranking members of various Rogues' Guilds, including some of the most nefarious assassin organizations, but this has never been proven.

Halflings may be [dragonmarked](Dragonmarked.md) with the [Mark of Healing](Healing.md) or the [Mark of Hospitality](Hospitality.md); see those entries for details.

### Lightfoot and Stout halflings
These halflings are pretty intermixed amongst each other by this point in Azgaarnoth's history, and no non-halfling can tell them apart. Culturally, there is no difference or differentiation between them.

### Ghostwise and Lotusden halflings
Some halflings have independently shown characteristics of these two subraces of halfling, but there appears to be no widespread shared genetic legacy--it seems to randomly appear in various halflings throughout Azgaarnoth. Ghostwise halflings frequently tend to end up associating with some of the psionic-leaning [Mage Schools](../Organizations/MageSchools/index.md) and Lotusden halflings often wander the wildnerness alongside druids and rangers.
