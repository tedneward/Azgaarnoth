# Undersea races
Within the last few centuries, scholars have begun to seek opportunities to explore this more deeply, and many are convinced that there is just as widespread a civilization and political system under the surface of the water as there is above it. This is collectively referred to as the "Undersea", and not much is known about it to the Abovesea.

## [Tortle](Tortles.md)
Seafarers have reported encountering tortle in various places all throughout the Deepwaters and oceans, but it's never been clear if they maintain a civilization, cities, or just nomadic bands.

## [Triton](Tritons.md)
Likewise, tritons have become more and more visible to the Abovesea folk. Their relationship with the tortle is not clear, but it does appear that they are on good terms with [sea elves](/Races/Elves.md). They also seem to have some sort of trade relationships with [lizardfolk](/Races/Lizardfolk.md) and [yuan-ti](/Races/YuanTi.md).
