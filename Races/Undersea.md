# Undersea races
Within the last few centuries, scholars have begun to seek opportunities to explore this more deeply, and many are convinced that there is just as widespread a civilization and political system under the surface of the water as there is above it. This is collectively referred to as the "Undersea", and not much is known about it to the Abovesea.

## [Water Genasi](Genasi.md#water)
Water genasi have lived among the Undersea for some time, it seems.

## [Merfolk](Merfolk.md)
The Merfolk, by all appearances, are humans who have gained the adaptation to the deep oceans and waters long ago. Whether Merfolk have always walked among the Abovesea in secret or are only recently rejoining their Abovesea cousins is not clear, but time has definitely differentiated them from their land-based cousins.

## [Siren](Siren.md)
The fabled siren, once thought to be mindless predators luring ships to their doom, have since been determined to be a full participant in the rich culture and civilization of the Undersea. Some siren have now taken to walking the Abovesea to satisfy their incessant curiosity.

## [Tortle](Tortles.md)
Seafarers have reported encountering tortle in various places all throughout the Deepwaters and oceans, but it's never been clear if they maintain a civilization, cities, or just nomadic bands.

## [Triton](Tritons.md)
Likewise, tritons have become more and more visible to the Abovesea folk. Their relationship with the tortle is not clear, but it does appear that they are on good terms with [sea elves](/Races/Elves.md). They also seem to have some sort of trade relationships with [lizardfolk](/Races/Lizardfolk.md) and [yuan-ti](/Races/YuanTi.md).
