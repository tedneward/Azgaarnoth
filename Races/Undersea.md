# Races of the Undersea
Within the last few centuries, scholars have begun to seek opportunities to explore this more deeply, and many are convinced that there is just as widespread a civilization and political system under the surface of the water as there is above it. This is collectively referred to as the "Undersea", and not much is known about it to the Abovesea.

Although the total population of the Undersea is not known, it is thought to be at least approaching that of the Abovesea, though with a much lower population density (since there is much more sea in which to live than land). Some scholars postulate that the increased presence of Undersea races is due to a population "crunch" beneath the waves, leading some Undersea tribes, clans, or families to consider live closer to, or even on, the shore.

## [Sea Elves](Elves.md#sea-elves-maerach)

## [Water Genasi](Genasi.md#water)
Water genasi have lived among the Undersea for some time, it seems.

## [Merfolk](Merfolk.md)
The Merfolk, by all appearances, are humans who have gained the adaptation to the deep oceans and waters long ago. Whether Merfolk have always walked among the Abovesea in secret or are only recently rejoining their Abovesea cousins is not clear, but time has definitely differentiated them from their land-based cousins.

## [Siren](Siren.md)
The fabled siren, once thought to be mindless predators luring ships to their doom, have since been determined to be a full participant in the rich culture and civilization of the Undersea. Some siren have now taken to walking the Abovesea to satisfy their incessant curiosity.

## [Tortle](Tortles.md)
Seafarers have reported encountering tortle in various places all throughout the Deepwaters and oceans, but it's never been clear if they maintain a civilization, cities, or just nomadic bands.

## [Triton](Tritons.md)
Likewise, tritons have become more and more visible to the Abovesea folk. Their relationship with the tortle is not clear, but it does appear that tritons are on good terms with [sea elves](/Races/Elves.md). They also seem to have some sort of trade relationships with [lizardfolk](/Races/Lizardfolk.md) and [yuan-ti](/Races/YuanTi.md).

Generally non-playable races in the Undersea include:

## [Kuo-Toa](/Creatures/KuoToa.md)
Kuo-toa are fishlike humanoids that once inhabited the shores and islands of the surface world. Long ago, however, they were driven into the cave systems and depths of the seas, where they dwell in everlasting night. Kuo-toa can no longer abide daylight. There they lament their fate and plan for revenge on all those who cast them into the darkness--which, to the modern kuo-toa, is everyone not kuo-toa.

## [Sahuagin](/Creatures/Sahuagin.md)
The sahuagin are thought to have come to Azgaarnoth with the Hordes, though in some shadowed corners of the world it is whispered that these are the result of the Eldars' first experiments to create the sea elves. (Speaking of this theory to either race earns immediate enmity.)
