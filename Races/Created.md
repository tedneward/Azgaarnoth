# Created
So named because they are the union (in some manner) of human and extra-planer creatures.

## [Aasamari](Aasimari.md)
Surprisingly, aasimari similarly face distrust and prejudice, and are often found in their own communities, frequently nomadic in nature. Aasimari/human children almost always turn out to be human, with some slightly enhanced genetics in the first generation, and as a result, it is not clear how new genetic infusions of tiefling and aasimari blood are introduced. (Some scholars speculate that the fiends and the celestials are actively taking a hand in enhancing said populations.)

## [Dragonborn](Dragonborn.md)
While the origins of the [elves](Firstborn.md) and [dwarves](Dwarves.md) (at least to start) are wrapped up in the [Eldar](Eldar.md), and the [dwarves](Firstborn.md)/[gnomes](Firstborn.md)/[halflings](Firstborn.md) in the Exodus, the history of the dragonborn (and their distant kin, tieflings and aasimar) is quite clear: dragonborn are a Created race, given life from dragons' eggs, and from there to flourish on their own. It is thought that even today, dragons periodically place a "firstborn dragonborn" (that is, Created from the egg) as an adoption with a family or other group to refresh the genetics of the race, though if true, it is not discussed among dragonborn. (Whether this is due to ignorance of their parentage or a deeper desire to preserve a secret is not known outside of the firstborn.)

## [Dragonkin](Dragonkin.md)
Dragonkin are also a Created race, though their actual history is more murky. Many seem to be of chromatic descent, making them less trustworthy than their Dragonborn cousins, and would explain for the two races' intrinsic hatred of each other. Dragonkin are often found among the [Hordes](Hordes.md), albeit in small numbers, which would lend credence to their chromatic backgrounds, but an equal number are found in the lands of [North Bedia](/Geography/Bedia.md), which certainly would not. Regardless, dragonkin do walk the lands of Azgaarnoth.

## [Dragonmarked](Dragonmarked.md)
A dragonmark is a mystic sigil that appears on the skin. The mark is a source of mystical power and enhances the bearerâ€™s ability to perform certain tasks.

## [Genasi](Genasi.md)
The elemental genasi are thought to be Created, though the Eldars' reasons for doing so aren't entirely clear; if the Created were intended to be the Eldars' final weapons against the Hordes, the genasi were not a succesful effort, since the genasi in general show no animosity to the Hordes whatsoever. It is also theorized that the genasi were, in fact, retribution from beings of other planes, demonstrating to the Eldar that others, too, could meddle with the people of Azgaarnoth.

## [Half-Dragons](Halves.md)
Half-dragons are entirely rare in the world, if they even exist at all. Most of those known half-dragons, at least through history, have been the product of a chromatic dragon and a mortal, and have had violent stories attached to them. It is not known whether metallic dragons do not have children by mortals; if they do, they clearly seek to keep them more well-hidden or remote. Chromatic half-dragons are often found amongst the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md), and often as part of the [Ulmhorde](/Nations/Ulm.md) in recent years.

## [Reborn](Reborn.md)
Shortly after the Created appeared, stories of individuals with strange ties to deceased ancestors began to circulate. These "reborn" of the dead were at first thought to be necromantic tricks, but over long years, it has become accepted that the walls between death and life are not so dense as once believed.

## [Tabaxi](Tabaxi.md)
The cat-like creatures that appeared roughly around the same time as the rest of the Created are found evenly throughout Azgaarnoth, though still rarely.

## [Tiefling](Tiefling.md)
That tieflings are a Created race is also clear and unmistakable--where the mystery lies is from which fiendish line they originate. Tieflings will often form exclusive communities of their own, which is not surprising given the prejudice they frequently encounter. What is not widely known is that tieflings can mate with humans, and the second- or third-generation product of such unions usually have lost all vestiges of their ancestral fiendish roots; even many first-generation tiefling/human unions find their tiefling heritage absent.

All of the tiefling bloodlines have been found in Azgaarnoth. There are slightly more Winged tieflings than the others, for indiscernible reasons.
