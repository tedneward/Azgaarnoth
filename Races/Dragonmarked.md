# Dragonmarked
It is believed that the dragonmark dates back to the very earliest days of the [Eldar](/Races/Eldar.md), and that the Eldar handed out the dragonmark to favored [Firstborn](/Races/Firstborn.md) or [humans](/Races/Humans.md) as rewards for excellent service. No [Created](/Races/Created.md) have ever borne a dragonmark, and for many milennia, it was believed that no [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md)ish race could bear one, but time has proven that to be a false assumption--at least, for those of mixed parentage.

[Dragonmarked](/Supplements/UA_Dragonmarks.pdf) are generally "born wild" and, once known, very quickly hunted down by either the [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md) or the [Cult of the Wyrm](/Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md), to either recruit or destroy. Dragonmarked are not part of a particular [noble House](/Organizations/Houses/Houses.md), but bloodlines do carry, and many of the noble Houses carry the dragonmark within their bloodlines... as do most of the other races by this point in Azgaarnoth's history, although perhaps not as strongly as the nobility.

Dragonmarks are associated with race and are represented by a combination of variant races and subraces.
* For humans, a dragonmark is a variant race that replaces the normal traits associated with those races.
* For half-elves and half-orcs, a dragonmark is a variant race. You keep some of the standard traits and replace others with the traits associated with your mark.
* For dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings, the dragonmark replaces your subrace. So, for example, if you’re making an elf character, you can choose to take the Mark of Shadow instead of being a wood elf or high elf.

There are two additional options related to dragonmarks. As your dragonmarked character grows in level, you can take the Greater Dragonmark feat (at the end of this page) to reflect the growing power of your dragonmark. Alternatively, the [Aberrant Dragonmark feat](/Classes/Feats.md#aberrant-dragonmark) grants limited but dangerous magical abilities to those who are not dragonmarked with a stable mark.

## Intuition Dice
A dragonmark improves your ability to perform a specific type of task. The Mark of Finding sharpens your senses and improves your perception, while the Mark of Making guides your hands when you work with artisan’s tools.

Each dragonmark has a trait that allows you to roll an Intuition die, a d4, when you perform an ability check with a particular skill or tool. You add the number rolled to the ability check. You don’t have to be proficient with the skill or tool to gain this benefit.

Feats, magic items, and other features may improve your Intuition die. This increases the type of die you roll by one size (d6, d8, d10) to a maximum of a d10. You can only roll one Intuition die for a check; if you receive Intuition dice from multiple sources, increase one die by one type and roll that one.

For example, if a dragonmarked trait and feat both grant intuition with Dexterity (Stealth) checks, you roll a d6, instead of a d4. Three instances would increase your Intuition Die to a d8, and so on.

## Dragonmark Appearance
A dragonmark is a distinctive symbol that appears on the skin. There are twelve known dragonmarks, each unique in design and power. A dragonmark can appear on any part of the body. One half-elf could have the Mark of Detection across an eye, while another has it in the palm of their hand. Dragonmarks are painted in vivid shades of blue and purple and seem to shimmer or even move slightly. When used, they grow warm to the touch and may glow (though this doesn’t produce useful illumination). A dragonmark can’t be removed—even if a limb bearing a dragonmark is cut away, the mark eventually manifests on another part of the bearer’s body. All dragonmarks share the same initial appearance but a dragonmark can grow in size and complexity if a character takes the Greater Dragonmark feat or if the mark is tied to class abilities.

While dragonmarks share the same general appearance, your dragonmark could have a unique quality. If you’d like to explore this, roll on the Dragonmark Quirks table.

## Feat: Greater Dragonmark
The Greater Dragonmark feat represents the evolution of a dragonmark—an exponential increase in both the size of the dragonmark and the powers it bestows.

Only a fraction of dragonmarked ever develop a Greater Dragonmark. The powers that they possess are more powerful than the wide magic that serves as the foundation of the magical economy. Teleportation, instant communication across vast distances—these services are rare, remarkable, and largely unique to the dragonmarked.

*Prerequisite: 8th level, Character must possess a dragonmark*
Your dragonmark has grown in size and power. This enhances your existing dragonmark, and the benefits are based on the mark that you already possess. A greater dragonmark provides the following benefits:
* The die type of your dragonmarked Intuition Die increases by one.
* Increase one ability score by 1, to a maximum of 20. The abilities available to you are based on your mark, as shown on the Greater Dragonmark Benefits table.
* You learn a set of spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot or using a material component. The list of spells, the spellcasting ability for these spells, and the type of rest you must complete in order to regain the use of these spells are shown on the Greater Dragonmark Benefits table.

To cast Leomund's secret chest using this feat and the Mark of Warding, you must have a dragonshard with a value of at least 100 gp. While you have this dragonshard in hand, it serves as the spell's focus, and you can use it to summon and dismiss the chest.
