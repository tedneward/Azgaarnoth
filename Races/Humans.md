# Humans
Owing to the prodigious rate at which humans reproduce, they are the dominant species of the Azgaarnothian lands, and are for the most part of a generic stock of human--vaguely mixed skin tones, humans were the servant race of the Eldar (the ancient ancestors to the elves) and flourished and took over much of the lands after the Fall. It is not clear if humans were created by the Eldar, or were uplifted by them. Either way, humans owe their civilization to the initial one built by the Eldar, inheriting it after the Eldars' Fall.

Humans may be [dragonmarked](Dragonmarked.md) with the Mark of Handling, the Mark of Making, the Mark of Passage, or the Mark of Sentinel; see that entry for details.

Human society is broken into several distinct cultures: [Al'Uma](/Cultures/AlUma.md), [Gozdor](/Cultures/Gozdor.md), [Anor](/Cultures/Anor.md), and [Dail](/Cultures/Dail.md).
