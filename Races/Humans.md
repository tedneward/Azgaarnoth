# Humans
Owing to the prodigious rate at which humans reproduce, they are the dominant species of the Azgaarnothian lands, and are for the most part of a generic stock of human--vaguely mixed skin tones, humans were the servant race of the Eldar (the ancient ancestors to the elves) and flourished and took over much of the lands after the Fall. It is not clear if humans were created by the Eldar, or were uplifted by them. Either way, humans owe their civilization to the initial one built by the Eldar, inheriting it after the Eldars' Fall.

(Broken into several cultures)
## Culture: Gozdor


## Culture: Al'Uma
When [Alalihat](/People/Alalihat.md) and [Zabalasa](/People/Zabalasa.md) forged their society in the hot plains of the north, they found that the various nomadic groups were less interested in building great cities than they were in engaging in their intertribal battles of petty conflict. It took a great deal of persuasion--and conquest--to convince these tribes that there was greater benefit to be had in unity, and many tribes agreed reluctantly. To the average Al'Uman, loyalty is to the family, the tribe, the Caliphate, and then the nation in which they live. In fact, tribes have been known to wander across the borders freely, as the moods or local situations suggest.

Al'Umans hold their religious duties very seriously, however, regardless of the state to which they belong. Each Al'Uman must greet the rising sun with a small ritual, and again at the setting of the sun, to feel comfortable with the world. The Al'Uman calendar is filled with holidays of various forms--one of the most joyous is the Day of the Fallen Fig, celebrating the day either Alalihat or Zabalasa (fierce debates rage over which) dropped a fig, bent to pick it up, and discovered a long-lost scholarly scroll under a table by doing so. Al'Uman life is a hard-working, hard-celebrating culture, and a popular phrase holds that an Al'Uman wedding is not considered successful unless there is at least one broken bone suffered. (Fortunately, Al'Uman doctors are among the best in the world, and widely cherished and respected throughout the north.)

## Culture: Anor
The starkly harsh existence that the residents of [Dradehalia](/Geography/Dradehalia.md) were forced to assume during their [war with the Hordes](/History/Modern.md) has led to the rise of an entirely new culture in the South, focusing on ruthlessness and focus. If not exactly cruel (although many willingly embrace cruelty), Anorians are also not compassionate, and see hardship as simply one more obstacle that must be overcome. Those who cannot overcome hardship simply did not deserve to live or thrive; those who did, did so because they understood that obstacles are there to be surpassed.

The average Anorian has no time in their life for gods, worship, or charity, as these things distract from the pursuit of survial. However, if any of these things provide clear progress on an Anorian's goals (perhaps worship at the altar of a god of agriculture has proven to generate better weather), they will embrace them without hesitation. To an Anorian, the outcome is all that matters.

Many who call themselves "Anorians" are not evil, but many of evil pursuit call themselves "Anorians". The Dread Emperor Himself sets the tone, and his court ensures that any who would dissent against the Dread Emperor is marginalized, silenced, or eliminated; as the center of Anorian culture, the Dread Imperial Court brooks no interference in their plans.

## Culture: Dail
