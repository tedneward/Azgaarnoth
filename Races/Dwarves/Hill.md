# Hill dwarf
The hill and mountain dwarves are essentially small genetic differences within the dwarven bloodline, but at this point in Azgaarnoth's history they are essentially meaningless as cultural differentiators--hill dwarves often work in the hills as part of their guild/clan, and mountain dwarves are often found in mountains for similar reasons. In fact, it's more common to see them in cities than in hills or mountains. Most non-dwarves can't even tell the difference between them.
