# Dark dwarves (*duergar*) ("Underdark dwarf")
Rumors persist of clans of dwarves that never participated as part of the Exodus (or were left behind either accidentally or deliberately, depending on the rumor), and were forced into hard living and driven deeper into the depths to survive. The *duergar*'s legends claim that those clans were captured by the *illithid* (mind flayers) at the same time elves were captured (who later became the [Gith](../Gith.md)). While most dwarves consider the "dark dwarves" to be myth, most scholars agree that the *duergar* are real, whatever their history. Rumors of *duergar* generally also tie into the rumors of tunnels that connect the western and eastern reaches of the Daw mountain range underneath the Ravensound, as such tunnels would provide adequate depth to hide them from the Hordes that precipitated the Exodus.

Most of the *duergar* encountered tend to be bitter and resentful, angry at the dwarves for their collective racial pain, with little to no remorse for the dwarves' own tragedies or history. *Duergar* are often paranoid and shun outsiders, though many that have come into contact with surface-dwellers have slowly adjusted their feelings and expectations accordingly. *Duergar* society is clan-based, much like the dwarves' was prior to the Exodus, and the bonds of clan often supersede all other concerns and obligations, even unto death.
