## [Dark gnomes](../../Creatures/Derro.md)
Like the dwarves and the elves, rumors abound of "dark gnomes" that live deep within the earth, but rumors cannot decide if these gnomes are abandoned Exodus tribes or tribes that never integrated with the dwarves to begin with. Rumor holds that these evil-tended gnomes live deep within the Daws Range, as part of the Underdark, and are frequently the target of Underdark slave raiders. Like their deep gnome cousins, dark gnomes have lost their "love of life"; unlike said cousins, the dark gnomes have gained a tendency to selfishness and cruelty in its place.
