Zhi is a nation of vibrant energy and culture. Long ago, this territory (and that of [Yithi](Yithi.md), to the south) were the lands of the Hordes, and a territory of brutal tribes bent on conquest of the world. Over millennia, however, repeated stalemates, alternating meaningless victories and defeats, and even the periodic peaceful contact with other races led the more militaristic tribes to sail south to take up their war against [Dradehalia](Dradehalia.md). Led by a charismatic minotaur named Yithi, the tribes that remained chose instead to look for ways to improve themselves and their lives and create a civilization of their own that didn't rely on constant warfare.

While Yithi sought to bring the remaining tribes in the south under a direct, strong control, many of his more intellectual and spiritual advisors moved north, partly to escape the ongoing conflict, and partly because they felt a calling to find a place where they could study Yithi's message more deeply and holistically. Eventually finding a comfortable site near where [Nacoal](../Cities/Nacoal.md) now rests, these formed the first Council of Seers.

Over time, those of the ex-Hordes who felt more drawn to martial pursuits or a more regimented society moved south, to join the tribes of the Principality (or to join Tragekia or the Ulmhorde), while those who felt drawn to higher learning and contemplative life moved north, and slowly populated the (then-)empty lands. Over time, Zhi became a nation thoroughly mixed of farmers and herders, working alongside artisans and philosophers. As Yithi found itself battling Zalabasa to the west and the Hordes to the south, Zhi became a haven and source of foodstuff, finely-crafted material goods, spiritual and arcane advice, and other support.

## Geography
![Zhian geography](Zhi.jpeg)

Surrounded by water on three sides, the lands of Zhi are hot and wet. Swamps, marshlands, and grasslands dominate the geography of Zhi, making rice a staple. Much of her goods are moved either over merchant shipping around the coastline, or over the Great Road that runs from [Nacoal](../Cities/Nacoal.md) to [Kraston](../Cities/Kraston.md).

The geography suits the Zhis, however--their daily regiment will often consist of farming or other menial tasks in the mornings and evenings, when it is cool, but retiring indoors to shade and breeze to study or meditate during the hottest parts of the day. Frequent rainstorms during the afternoons often aid in the contemplation of the universe.

## Government
**TODO**, High Theocrat of Zhi

Zhi is a theocracy, governed by a Council of Seers, of whom they periodically select one of their own to stand in as executive for a time of some years (the number is never declared ahead of time). This High Theocrat serves as the deciding vote in any Council discussion, and their decision is final--until the next High Theocrat chooses to listen to a challenge to that decision brought within the Council. To many outsiders, this way of governing seems pointless and redundant, but to the Zhi, any important decision is probably important enough must be revisited from time to time, and they find this mode works for them--as it has for the past several milennia.

Outside the Council of Seers, each province within Zhi is ruled by an Advisor, and the cities themselves are governed by an appointed Governor. Governors select the Advisor to represent their province, and the Advisor in turn is responsible for elevating a new Governor when an opening appears.

Like Yithi, Zhi has roving magistrates called Marshals, often minotaurs, that roam the land offering a traveling system of justice to the outlying villages. A Marshal's visitation is often a time of quiet celebration, as long-standing civil disputes can be adjudicated, wrongs can be fixed, and pleas can be carried to the provincial capital or even the Council of Seers themselves. Marshals answer only to their own organization, which is operated directly by the Council of Seers, and act as an important check on the power that might be used for corrupt purposes by less-honorable Advisors or Governors. A Marshal's report is given great weight, and many an Advisor or Governor has faced eviction or even conviction based on the word of a Marshal alone.

## Political structure
Zhi is made up of four provinces:

* **Yeqasha** to the north. The cities here are given to much interaction with the sea, and much of the local diet comes from imported rice from Rhial to the south, seafood gathered from the sea (and imported from Cinhu), and locally-tended herds. [Ma'naron](../Cities/Manaron.md), [Kulris](../Cities/Kulris.md), [Narcoal](../Cities/Narcoal.md) are all extensive port cities, and have significant naval presence here, both Zhian navy and [Sea Reaver](../Organizations/MercCompanies/SeaReavers.md) ships. [Llicuston](../Cities/Llicuston.md) is a major trade city, and [Lhamalithazak](../Cities/Lhamalithazak.md) provides much of the additional agriculture consumed throughout the region, particularly spices and herbs.

* **Rhial** through central Zhi. Much of the farming that goes on in Zhi does so in Rhial, and [Arathurlamaa](../Cities/Arathurlamaa.md) is a major rice exporter to almost all of Zhi and Yithi. The "twin cities" of [Tanhos](../Cities/Tanhos.md) and [Rathisithimor](../Cities/Rathisithimor.md) also export foodstuffs, but more vegetables and fruits than rice.

* **Onhaven** to the southwest of Rhial, bordering on Yithi. This province is where much of the trade with Yithi happens, 

* **Cinhu** is made up of two "fragments" of land: the Island of Cinhu off the Zhian northwestern coast, and a small portion of land purchased from the Dheubpurwen tribe of the Yithi. These lands seem to be given over almost entirely to the [yuan-ti](../Races/YuanTi.md) and [lizardfolk](../Races/Lizardfolk.md), who govern in the Council's name but are otherwise "uncivilized". The province has no major cities, which seems to suit the yuan-ti and lizardfolk fine, but has an Advisor from the people of that province in a manner that is unknown to all but the population living there. Surprisingly, perhaps, Cinhu provides a steady supply of mystics and shamans to the Council, and negotiations are already under way with the Dheubpurwen Yithi for the purchase of more land.

## Population
Without a doubt, Zhi is the most evenly-populated nation in all of Azgaarnoth, if lightly so. Almost a million sentient beings are mostly evenly divided among her three larger provinces (the fourth, Cinhu, being by far the smallest by an order of magnitude), and generally the races intermingle freely and openly--it is extremely rare to find a "elves' quarter" or "halfling shire" anywhere within the borders of Zhi, although it is often that some of the racial styles are populated by a cross-section of races. In fact, in Yeqasha Province the halfling "shire" style of architecture--that of "halfling-holes" in the ground--is quite popular among all the races, as homes buried in ground are quite cool during the hottest parts of the day. Some have even taken up the halfling habit of farming the ground above their home--which can be quite tricky when you're growing rice.

Zhi is also the original home to the [yuan-ti](../Races/YuanTi.md) and [kenku](../Races/Kenku.md) within Azgaarnoth, and much of Zhi is dotted with settlements of [lizardfolk](../Races/Lizardfolk.md) and even more open visitations from [tortles](../Races/Tortles.md) and [tritons](../Races/Tritons.md). This apparent friendship with the races of the Undersea has a tendency to make the nations of the south and the west somewhat nervous at what might be happening there without their knowledge. Zhi also has the highest concentration of [spirit folk](../Races/SpiritFolk/) in Azgaarnoth.

## Culture
Zhi is a nation of philosophers, astronomers, poets, artists, and more. Higher learning is the highest calling among the Zhi, and as a nation they show little reverence for gods or Eldar, but instead choose to commune with the spirits of those who have come before them, or with beings far beyond mortal comprehension. They openly welcome all religious thought, however, because if the mysteries of the universe are beyond mortal comprehension, who is to say that which religion is right, or wrong, or even real?

Today, Zhi is a land of quiet contemplation, with much energy devoted to the unraveling of the secrets of the universe. Monastic orders are found in quite a few places, and monks are frequently found wandering the roads, trading manual labor in the fields in return for a night's room and board, which the villagers are entirely happy to provide. The unbelievably equal mix of races in Zhi means that racial differences are almost entirely unseen; it is not uncommon to see orcs and elves studying the stars together, dwarves and goblins will often toil together over the same book or forge, and halflings will happily pair with minotaurs in the fields to feed them all.

## Relations
**[Alalihat](Alalihat.md)**: Antagonistic. Like Zabalasa, Zhi has no common border with the Alalihatians; when Alalihatian naval vessels round the Almalzish northern borders and journey deep into Zabalasan waters, they tend to take the opportunities to attack Zhian naval vessels or stage raids along the Zhi coast--and usually come out the worse for it. Zhi has no interest in Alalihatian affairs, and if anything prefers the war between the Disciples to continue indefinitely.

**[Almalz](Almalz.md)**: Suspicion. Almalzish vessels are welcome at Zhian ports and coastal cities, but more than once Alalihatian and Zhian vessels have tried to masquerade as Almalzish and raid those same ports and cities, so the Zhian officials tend to put all Al'Uman merchants under the same cloud of suspicion. Ironically, much of Almalz wants the same as Zhi: to study and contemplate, which leads many on the Council to hope that one day, a better relationship can be had.

**[Bagonbia](Bagonbia.md)**: Neutral bordering on Apathetic. Zhi has almost no contact with them.

**[Bedia](Bedia.md)**: Apathetic. Zhi has almost no contact with them.

**[Dradehalia](Dradehalia.md)**: Suspicion. While Zhi holds no direct hostility to the people of Dradehalia, they deeply distrust the Dread Emperor, and constantly move to understand his goals and determination to achieve them.

**[Liria](Liria.md)**: Cautious friendship. As Yithi and Zhi have grown more "civilized", more and more tenuous connections with Lirian agencies and courts have followed. Some Houses now extend across the borders, though little to no official political obligations constrain Zhi to Lirian aid, or vice vera. The growing friendship between Zhi and Travenia is a source of consternation for Lirian diplomats.

**[Mighalia](Mighalia.md)**: Friendly. Zhi has almost no contact with them, owing to the relatively small size of the Mighalian city-state and the relative difficulties of reaching each other. However, those Mighalians who make the journey are welcome in Zhi, and many Zhians find Mighal a fascinating place to visit and study.

**[Tragekia](Tragekia.md)**: 

**[Travenia](Travenia.md)**: Cautious friendship. As Yithi and Zhi have grown more "civilized", more and more tenuous connections with Travenian agencies and courts have followed. Some Houses now extend across the borders, no official political obligations constrain Zhi to Travenian aid, or vice vera. The growing friendship between Zhi and Liria is a source of consternation for Travenian diplomats.

**[Travesimia](Travesimia.md)**: Neutral; curiosity. Travesimia, being even further west than Travenia, is a source of curiosity to most Zhians, and the constant state of argument over ancient squabbles fascinates most Zhians. They take no open stance on any of Travesimia's affairs, but are happy to welcome visitors and trade with them when they make the long journey. 

**[Ulm](Ulm.md)**: Hostility. Zhi feels the Ulmhorde is an existential threat to everything Yithi sought to accomplish for the tribes.

**[Whaveminsia](Whaveminsia.md)**: Apathetic. Zhi has almost no contact with them.

**[Yithi](Yithi.md)**: Allies. Zhi and Yithi have been close, working allies ever since Yithi himself began to carve out a homeland for his people. Legends say that a group of mystics and shamans approached him with a proposal: they would help Yithi cement his nation's place in the world, in exchange for his sponsorship and guardianship of a nation to the northeast in which scholars could live and study. To this day, the Prince and the Council keep a near-constant correspondance and work closely together.

**[Zabalasa](Zabalasa.md)**: Antagonistic. Zhi shares no common border with the eastern al'Umans, but this does not stop the Zabalasans from extending their hostility with Yithi to Zhi. Most conflict comes in the form of raids and sea battles, where the numerical superiority of the Zabalasans is usually more than offset by the mystical and monastic elements Zhi fields as part of their small but powerful navy.
