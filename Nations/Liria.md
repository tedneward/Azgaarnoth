# Liria

Dominant nation in Azgaarnoth. Originally Liria spanned all of the west and south, with the Hordes alone confronting them in the east (near where the Principality of [Yilith](Yilith.md) lies now). Liria is an "old" nation, and many of her cities have ruins of previous generations of city buildings lying beneath them, having been razed somewhere in their history and then rebuilt.

40% human, 15% dwarven, 15% elven, 15% halfing, 10% Created (dragonborn, tiefling, aasimari), and the remainder a smattering of just about every race found anywhere Azgaarnoth. Even Hordes races can be found living in Liria, usually under a cloud of suspicion within the cities.
