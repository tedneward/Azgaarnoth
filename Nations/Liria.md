# Liria

Dominant nation in Azgaarnoth. Originally Liria spanned all of the west and south, with the Hordes alone confronting them in the east (near where the Principality of [Yilith](Yilith.md) lies now). Liria is an "old" nation, and many of her cities have ruins of previous generations of city buildings lying beneath them, having been razed somewhere in their history and then rebuilt.

Liria is also a nation that is straining at the seams, with a very weak central government bordering almost on the absent. Beyond organizing military compaigns against her various opponents, the governing council in Liria (nominally led by a King/Emperor) leaves most of the cities and provinces in the hands of her governors, who over the last milennia have established their own royal lines and history. It is not uncommon, in fact, for the ruler over a Lirian city fancy themselves a King, whose allegiance is to the Emperor in [Flakew](/Cities/Flakew.md). This really makes Liria more of a confederation than an empire, but tradition looms large in the mind of the Lirian nobility, and when the Emperor issues an edict, all of the "kings" respond.

(It should be noted that not all governors have equal delusions of grandeur, and style themselves only as "dukes" or "counts". For the most part, however, all are of equal rank within the Lirian system of government, and the more distant they are from Flakew, the more independent they act. It is this very tendency, in fact, that has led so many of their historical peers to secede from the nation as a whole.)

If Liria could ever see a strong leader emerge onto its Imperial Throne, it is likely that the nation could be re-forged into a single entity, and Liria might be able to recapture much of its former glory. Beset with all of the battles on all of its fronts, however, Liria struggles to make gains, and as such sits on the edge of either chaos or resurgence.

40% human, 15% dwarven, 15% elven, 15% halfing, 10% Created (dragonborn, tiefling, aasimari), and the remainder a smattering of just about every race found anywhere Azgaarnoth. Even Hordes races can be found living in Liria, usually under a cloud of suspicion within the cities.
