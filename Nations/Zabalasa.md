## Relations
**[Alalihat](../Nations/Alalihat.md)**: Hostile. They seek to impose their heretical will upon all of Al'Uma, and so long as Zabalasa follows the Disciple, there will never be peace.

**[Almalz](../Nations/Almalz.md)**: Peace. Almalz is filled with cousins and relatives of the Zabalasan tribes, and officially is the sacred Caliphate that guards the relics of the Prophet and his Disciple. Zabalasans and Alalihatians will stab each other mercilessly outside of Almalz, but within, maintain a tense and careful peace. (Of course, this in no way stops espionage and spycraft, and many's the murder in the Almalzian city that goes officially uninvestigated.)

**[Bagonbia](../Nations/Bagonbia.md)**: Neutral. Zabalasa honors some trade between the nations, but little contact beyond that.

**[Bedia](../Nations/Bedia.md)**: Apathetic. Zabalasa has little to no contact with Bedia.

**[Dradehalia](../Nations/Dradehalia.md):** Suspicious. Zabalasa has at times been the target of the Dread Emperor's machinations, so Dradehalians are often viewed with some suspicion. Trade is minimal, yet present.

**[Liria](../Nations/Liria.md)**: Officially hostile; in practice, cautious. A major war between Liria and Zabalasa has not happened in several centuries, so while they officially remain at war, many back-channel communications take place, and Lirians who visit Zabalasa (and vice versa) are allowed (some) freedom of movement.

**[Mighalia](../Nations/Mighalia.md)**: Warm. Zabalasa has many open connections with the nation of the Free City, and much of their back-channel communication with the West flows through Mighal.

**[Tragekia](../Nations/Tragekia.md)**: Suspicious. Tragekia's Hordish nature and history make them difficult to trust, despite the lack of significant warfare between the two nations over the past milennium.

**[Travenia](../Nations/Travenia.md)**:

**[Travesimia](../Nations/Travesimia.md)**:

**[Ulm](../Nations/Ulm.md)**: Open warfare. Most contact occurs at sea, where Zabalasan privateers prey on Ulmhorde ships, and vice versa. Any Ulmhorde found in Zabalasa is arrested and questioned.

**[Whaveminsia](../Nations/Whaveminsia.md)**: Indifferent. There is a little open trade with Whaveminsia, but almost no official contact or communication.

**[Yithi](../Nations/Yithi.md)**: Hostile. The Zabalasans still see the Yithi as the inheritors of the legacy of the Hordes, and the long conflict between the Hordes and Eldar mean, to the Zalabasans, that there is a moral imperative to crush Yithi. Thus, Zalabasa currently stands in open war against Yithi, creating a constant set of tension and open battles along Yithi's western border. Practically, the war is at something of a standstill, as the Zabalasans are not yet comfortable with operating out of the Daw Mountains. In particular, Zabalasa has yet to find a way to crack the three-city fortress line of Dheubpurwen, Jernovalrimi, and Krikal, and the longer the Yithi have to fortify those positions, the less likely the war will progress beyond that line. At sea, Yithi ships generally win out in combats over the Zabalasan vessels, and the [Sea Reavers](../Organizations/MercCompanies/SeaReavers.md), which frustrates the Zabalasans enormously.

**[Zhi](../Nations/Zhi.md)**: Hostile. Zhi is Yithi's close and staunch ally, and therefore Zabalasa finds themselves at war with the Zhians as well as Yithi.
