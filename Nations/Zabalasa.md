# Zabalasa / Caliphate of Zabalasa
* **Government**: Confederation/Empire
* **Capital**: [Svishek](../Cities/Svishek.md)
* **Population**: 

When the Eldar created the humans, many of them found the vast, open lands of the Northeastern continent to be the perfect place to raise herds and indulge in wanderlust. The hot, well-hydrated climate of the Al'Uman lands appealed to those who found great joy in horsemanship and nomadic life.

When the Hordes began their wars against the Eldar and their children in what is now Yithi, the humans were very much on the front lines of the battle--many of them the horse-bound tribes of the Al'Uma, slashing at the flanks of Hordish armies as battles raged up and down the length of the Daws range. Nomadic life became more of a military necessity than just a cultural or lifestyle choice, and the tribes learned how keeping mobile kept enemies from destroying your livelihood when they burned crops and buildings.

As the wars ground down and the Eldar slipped away, the nomads found a certain rhythm to their life, but little in the way of larger purpose--until the emergence of the [Prophet](../People/Alalihat.md), Alalihat. His teachings brought new understanding and new meaning to the People, and before long his words were sacrosanct--if not law, then certainly with great emphasis.

When his [Disciple](../People/Zabalasa.md) openly questioned the Prophet's teachings, bringing a different view to bear, it bitterly divided the People, and before long what was once a single nation of nomads was divided in twain--and then thrice, when a few generations later a number of clans carved out the nation of [Almalz](Almalz.md) as a holy neutral party. Al'Uman tribe battled Al'Uman tribe across a frantic cultural divide. Before long, it is said, more Al'Uman blood was spilled at Al'Uman hands than any Hordish army.

Over the following long years, the religious wars of the Caliphs came to a begrudging stalemate, as Caliphs from each side of the border came to realize that there was no easy victory to be had. Over time, the open grasslands beckoned tribes to raid--not war--across the fluid and invisible border, and in time Alalihatian and Zabalasan found there to be common cause again in battling the Hordes again, only to discover that some portion of the Hordes had moved south into what is now Tragekia (and then again, in to Dradehalia). Zabalasans in particular look across their eastern border today (into Yithi) and find Hordish races, but much non-Hordish behavior. Some Zabalasan scholars even go so far as to suggest that their eastern neighbors should be treated as allies and friends, violating all that the history of Al'Uma teaches.

Today, the Caliphate of Zabalasa carries on its ancient traditions, its ancient feuds with its distant kin, and dreams of a day when all of Al'Uma is united again, a vast rolling wave of robed horse warriors cresting over the hills to finally crush and eliminate the ancient Hordish enemy. But in the meantime, there are tribes across the border (as well as a few on this side) to raid, Hordish neighbors to their east to battle, herds to tend and sell in the cities, waters to sail, horses to ride, and family to protect and expand.

## Government
**TODO**, Caliph of Zabalasa, First Sultan of Damam

## Political Structure
Zabalasa is broken into several provinces, each of which are governed by a Sultan. The Caliph, for example, also holds the title as Sultan of the province of Damam.

* Damam County: home to the cities of [Svishek](), [Gorod](), [Bunov](), [Mlin](), [Ternit](), [Trigov](), and [Yulidychin]().
* Mirbah Territory: [Rebun](), [Samborna](), [Eshamerino](), [Dukoml](), [Kogorokipo](), and [Mochu]().
* Janaradad County:
* Alalharaqa Earldom:
* Suwaiqa County:
* Al Sibarmia Earldom:
* Al Mayitahia Earldom:
* Al Thuma County:

Each of the Sultans maintains a Court in each city, as well as one in Svishek, each Court staffed with officers and proxies for the Sultan, who travels between their cities and Svishek, holding hearings and adminstering to their staff.

## Relations
**[Alalihat](../Nations/Alalihat.md)**: Hostile. They seek to impose their heretical will upon all of Al'Uma, and so long as Zabalasa follows the Disciple, there will never be peace.

**[Almalz](../Nations/Almalz.md)**: Peace. Almalz is filled with cousins and relatives of the Zabalasan tribes, and officially is the sacred Caliphate that guards the relics of the Prophet and his Disciple. Zabalasans and Alalihatians will stab each other mercilessly outside of Almalz, but within, maintain a tense and careful peace. (Of course, this in no way stops espionage and spycraft, and many's the murder in the Almalzian city that goes officially uninvestigated.)

**[Bagonbia](../Nations/Bagonbia.md)**: Neutral. Zabalasa honors some trade between the nations, but little contact beyond that.

**[Bedia](../Nations/Bedia.md)**: Apathetic. Zabalasa has little to no contact with Bedia.

**[Dradehalia](../Nations/Dradehalia.md):** Suspicious. Zabalasa has at times been the target of the Dread Emperor's machinations, so Dradehalians are often viewed with some suspicion. Trade is minimal, yet present.

**[Liria](../Nations/Liria.md)**: Officially hostile; in practice, cautious. A major war between Liria and Zabalasa has not happened in several centuries, so while they officially remain at war, many back-channel communications take place, and Lirians who visit Zabalasa (and vice versa) are allowed (some) freedom of movement.

**[Mighalia](../Nations/Mighalia.md)**: Warm. Zabalasa has many open connections with the nation of the Free City, and much of their back-channel communication with the West flows through Mighal.

**[Tragekia](../Nations/Tragekia.md)**: Suspicious. Tragekia's Hordish nature and history make them difficult to trust, despite the lack of significant warfare between the two nations over the past milennium.

**[Travenia](../Nations/Travenia.md)**:

**[Travesimia](../Nations/Travesimia.md)**:

**[Ulm](../Nations/Ulm.md)**: Open warfare. Most contact occurs at sea, where Zabalasan privateers prey on Ulmhorde ships, and vice versa. Any Ulmhorde found in Zabalasa is arrested and questioned.

**[Whaveminsia](../Nations/Whaveminsia.md)**: Indifferent. There is a little open trade with Whaveminsia, but almost no official contact or communication.

**[Yithi](../Nations/Yithi.md)**: Hostile. The Zabalasans still see the Yithi as the inheritors of the legacy of the Hordes, and the long conflict between the Hordes and Eldar mean, to the Zalabasans, that there is a moral imperative to crush Yithi. Thus, Zalabasa currently stands in open war against Yithi, creating a constant set of tension and open battles along Yithi's western border. Practically, the war is at something of a standstill, as the Zabalasans are not yet comfortable with operating out of the Daw Mountains. In particular, Zabalasa has yet to find a way to crack the three-city fortress line of Dheubpurwen, Jernovalrimi, and Krikal, and the longer the Yithi have to fortify those positions, the less likely the war will progress beyond that line. At sea, Yithi ships generally win out in combats over the Zabalasan vessels, and the [Sea Reavers](../Organizations/MercCompanies/SeaReavers.md), which frustrates the Zabalasans enormously.

**[Zhi](../Nations/Zhi.md)**: Hostile. Zhi is Yithi's close and staunch ally, and therefore Zabalasa finds themselves at war with the Zhians as well as Yithi.
