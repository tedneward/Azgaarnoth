## The common world
Being a commoner in Azgaarnoth is not as dark as the above summarization might imply; in fact, compared to the Dark Ages of Western Europe, commoners enjoy a relatively brisk and peaceful life--although the details may differ depending on which land one calls hoome. For most of the world, life is similar to that of the Earthen Renaissance: life offers a great deal of options to those who choose to stay at home and apprentice to a master, learn a craft, hone it through years of use, eventually becoming a master and opening up apprenticeships for a new generation. Food is, for the most part, plentiful, thanks to the intervention of gods and clerics. Bandits are generally rare, though certainly not unknown, and while most cities certainly have their "poor quarter", it is still a zone in which the lower classes are not relegating to crushing poverty of the deepest despair. Monstrous raids on isolated villages do happen, generally once or twice in the average villager's lifetime, but less often than having a son or brother or cousin go off to war and never to return.

## Magic
Like most worlds, magic is found throughout Azgaarnoth, but to the average citizen, it is an unachievable dream to wield it. Aside from those few who are born with it in their veins and go on to become sorcerers (training or no), or those who forge unthinkable pacts with unfathomable beings to become warlocks, magic remains the province of deep study, commitment, and practice. The magic of clerics, paladins, and druids requires dedication to a higher calling; the magic of bards, rangers, and monks requires study and practice. Mind-magic, aka psionics, is available in more widespread fashion in Yithia, but is still available for study in the West--if one has the dedication and time to devote to it.
