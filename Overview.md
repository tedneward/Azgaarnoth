## Geography
![Azgaarnoth](Azgaarnoth.jpeg)

The globe upon which Azgaarnoth rests is roughly equivalent to that of Earth, with a similar annual period around its star. Azgaarnoth's yearly cycle is slightly shorter, an even 360 days, and each daily cycle runs a similar 24 hours.

The "continent" of Azgaarnoth lies south of the equator, and occupies about an eighth overall of the globe's surface. What lies to the north, east, and west of Azgaarnoth is not known to most who dwell there, as expeditions in those cardinal directions have universally met with either failure or disappeared into the unknown.

Because of its relationship to the equator, Azgaarnoth's northern latitudes are warmer than the southern; in fact, the equator actually runs through the northernmost cities of Merevets and Svishek. The preponderance of water surrounding the various nations of Azgaarnoth, coupled with the relative low altitudes of the landmasses, and the pervasive heat, all combine to form a landmass that is almost universally hot, flat, and wet, particularly in the northernmost landmasses (Al'Uma, for example). As one travels further south, temperatures cool off, and in the southernmost parts of Azgaarnoth, it is not uncommon to see snow in winters.

## Astrophysics
Azgaarnoth has [four moons](/Geography/Moons.md), sits fourth in its solar system of seven planets, and orbits a yellow sun similar to Earth's. It has an annual cycle of 360 days (which is broken into twelve months of 30 days each, though the different nations have different names for the months) and a daily cycle of 24 hours.

## The common world
Being a commoner in Azgaarnoth is not as dark as some might expect; in fact, compared to the Dark Ages of Western Europe, commoners enjoy a relatively brisk and peaceful life--although the details may differ depending on which land one calls hoome. For most of the world, life is similar to that of the European Renaissance: life offers a great deal of options to those who choose to stay at home and apprentice to a master, learn a craft, hone it through years of use, eventually becoming a master and opening up apprenticeships for a new generation.

Food is, for the most part, plentiful, thanks to the intervention of gods and clerics.Agriculture remains a dominant role for the commoners of Azgaarnoth, with many of the traditional cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, oils, meat, milk, fungi and eggs that players would know from European and Asian backgrounds. Rice is particularly common among diets across Azgaarnoth. Fishing is a staple activity, and the preponderance of rivers across the continents means that fishermen are often found even several hundred miles from the nearest coastline. Much of Al'Uma agriculture is nomadic pastoralism (herds of livestock moved across the grasslands for pasture) combined with subsistence farming, where much of the rest of Azgaarnoth practices a combination of subsistence farming and intensive farming. Several merchant guilds specialize in the growth and distribution of intensive farming agriculture, and most intensive farming heads to the various cities around Azgaarnoth.

Bandits in most parts of the world are generally rare, though certainly not unknown, and while most cities certainly have their "poor quarter", lower classes are not relegated to crushing poverty of the deepest despair. Raids on isolated villages do happen (particularly in the "wilder" lands of Northern Bedia, or where open warfare dominates the land, such as on the continent of Chidia), generally once or twice in the average villager's lifetime, but less often than having a son or brother or cousin go off to war and never to return. "Monsters" are more prevalent, since what one commoner may term a "monster" is what another might term "fellow citizen", but what traditional D&D considers "monsters" generally fall within the descriptor of "the Hordes", and the Hordes have founded, and administer, their own nations.

## Magic
Like most worlds, magic is found throughout Azgaarnoth, but to the average citizen, it is an unachievable dream to wield it. Aside from those few who are born with it in their veins and go on to become sorcerers (training or no), or those who forge unthinkable pacts with unfathomable beings to become warlocks, magic remains the province of deep study, commitment, and practice. The magic of clerics, paladins, and druids requires dedication to a higher calling; the magic of bards, rangers, and monks requires study and practice. Mind-magic, aka psionics, is available in more widespread fashion in Yithia, but is still available for study in the West--if one has the dedication and time to devote to it.
