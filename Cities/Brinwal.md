Population: 8,500 -- 40% human, 45% Firstborn, 15% Created

Features: Port, Walled, Marketplace, Shantytown

Brinwal has a healthy shipping lane that goes back and forth between itself and [Stagraven](Stagraven.md), [Northraven](Northraven.md), [Crystargar](Crystargar.md), and many ships from further beyond. It generally doesn't ship to [Stagrorest](Stagrorest.md) or [Shimberg](Shimberg.md), since land routes are generally cheaper, though this has become less common as merchants report some unusual activity in the local Daws range (nicknamed the "Wyrmsmoke Mountains").

Brinwal is a small city on the western coast of the Ravensound, just south of [Stagrorest](Stagrorest.md). A major trade road, the Dawn Way, connects Brinwal to [Shimberg](Shimberg.md), and Brinwal has a major port that handles shipping all up and down the Ravensound.

## Dueling Schools
There are no dueling schools in Brinwal.

## Bardic Colleges

### Brinwal Academy
Brinwal has a school for higher learning, the Brinwal Academy (very roughly patterned on the Great Academy of the Bronze), and teaches history, magical theory, geography, culture, and most of all, the entertainment arts. 

The Brinwal Academy routinely puts on shows for the populace at Velorian's (a playhouse), and at least one Bard 1 departs the Academy every year, and many return to take up study of the Bardic [College of Lore](/Classes/Bard/Lore.md) before departing again. A few study the [College of Satire](/Classes/Bard/Satire.md).

## Great Houses

### [House Jarmaath](/Organizations/Houses/Jarmaath.md)
Lord Kerden Jarmaath is a solid figure of the House Jarmaath in Brinwal, and rules both his city and his House with a firm but fair hand. He has numerous siblings that he has seen placed in positions of authority throughout the peninsula, but currently lacks a wife or heir, which makes plenty of people nervous, thinking that Brinwal is one assassin's knife away from rulership by House Kaal.

### [House Kaal](/Organizations/Houses/Kaal.md)
Lady Verrasa Kaal is struggling to rekindle the reputation of her House, even as she secretly consorts with the various sorts of people that has brought her House low in recent decades. Verrasa Kaal has chosen to take a quieter approach than her siblings in other cities, however, and seeks to leverage the mercantile power of her House's merchant guild to make loans and forgive debts as necessary to call in favors. She will not openly oppose House Jarmaath, even as she secretly undermines them for her own House's benefit, but in truth she has no desire for the Baronial Seat, since that would make it harder for her to keep her relationship with Rillor Paln. She would rather keep Jarmaath on the throne and work from the shadows.

### [House Teskerwill](/Organizations/Houses/Teskerwill.md)
House Teskerwill in Brinwal is headed by the widower Owen Teskerwill (Human male Commoner, NG). Continuing the long tradition of Teskerwill horsebreeding, Owen has built a sizable holding here, and looks forward to handing it over to one of his three adult children (Kharra (Human female Fighter 3 (Cavalier) NG), Hurndahl (Human male Fighter 2), and Danella (Human female Commoner)) to carry on after his passing.

Danella currently is dating a cousin of House Jarmaath, and will likely marry into that House before long, cementing further ties between Jarmaath and Teskerwill.

### House Haskinar
House Haskinar is a recent addition to the Game of Houses, with Rhola Haskinar (Dragonborn female Fighter (Cavalier) 4, CG) having received a patent of royalty from Kedren Jarmaath a decade ago. Haskinar has leveraged that to gain deep economic commitments from the farmers around Brinwal, and now Haskinar either owns, finances, or has alliances with virtually all of the farmers that surround the city.

Rhola has a large family, and has recently begun the task of securing her family as a House by examining advantageous marriage proposals for her four sons and five daughters of various ages.

Haskinar is in a bitter feud of words with House Kaal; specifically, Rhola Haskinar cannot stand Verrasa Kaal (and vice versa), and the war of words between the two frequently spills out into the streets.

## Mage Schools

### Red Magic College
A small (~12) [Five Elements](/Organizations/MageSchools/FiveElements.md) school is here, headed by Immerstal "the Red" Paedralian, though in truth he heads the school only so that the Five Elements will partly fund his workshop and research. He is not known to be a great teacher, though he is by all accounts an extremely competent mage. Students here are mostly self-taught, and have no loyalty to Immerstal or the school. 

Immerstal's partner (Alandri, who, unbeknownst to him, is a polymorphed [gynosphinx](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/monsters-s#Gynosphinx) studying mortalkind up close) runs the shop on the first floor of his "tower" (really a two-story building with a basement that serves as his workshop, with a few additional rooms for the students to sleep). 

The Red is openly disdainful of "wilders" and "rootless vagabond" magi who insist on traveling, and has more than once seen another arcane spellcaster passing through town as a rival--sometimes even going so far as to openly declare an arcane duel.

Immerstal's shop/school routinely sells *common* magic items, and the prices are non-negotiable. Many items of *uncommon* rarity can be commissioned, with half the price up front as a deposit.

## Mercenary Companies
No mercenary companies are currently under contract to Brinwal, but the [Shining Axe Company](/Organizations/MercCompanies/ShiningAxeCompany.md) quarters in the nearby town of Hammerfist Holds when they are not under contract, and have a long history of working for Brinwal.

## Religions

### Kaevarian Church
The Church maintains a small diocese (~250 attendants) here, and has some ties to the community. The current Bishop of the diocese is relatively new, Bishop Laeran Purrosal (Half-elf female Cleric 2), and has just begun to settle in to leading the locals in worship.

The Church has a staff of 3 clerics (all Cleric 1) to aid the Bishop, and they sell some common divine magic items, including potions of healing.

### Pantheon

The dominant worship center of Brinwal is the Cathedral of Pelor, headed by Tredora Goldenbrow. She has a few clerics that aid her in her duties, and her temple has the largest (~1000) number of celebrants here.

The Pantheon has several smaller (roughly a hundred or so each) temples/cells here of various dieties, to [Brigantia](/Religions/Pantheon/Brigantia.md), [Ehlonna](/Religions/Pantheon/Ehlonna.md), [Gond](/Religions/Pantheon/Gond.md), and [Larethian](/Religions/Pantheon/Larethian.md).

Additionally, a high priestess of [Wee Jas](/Religions/Pantheon/WeeJas.md), High Mourner Mhiram (Elf (High) female Cleric (Death) of Wee Jas 5, N) built a gradiose and soaring temple over the Brinwal Graveyard. It is not clear from where the funds came from for that building, but the populace bears the priests no ill will; for as long as Brinwal has stood, the clerics of Wee Jas have been faithfully performing funerals and burial rites for free for those who cannot afford them, and Brinwal has remained remarkably free of undead for as far back as anyone can remember. The High Mourner has two more assistants (Cleric (Death) of Wee Jas 3) to assist her, and currently has about a hundred worshippers. She and Tredora Goldenbrow constantly seek to draw off worshippers from each others' congregations, but the rivalry is mostly good-natured, and the two frequently meet along with the Bishop of Kaevar to discuss divine matters.

## Rogues' Guilds

### [Black Knives](/Organizations/RoguesGuilds/BlackKnives.md)
The local Black Knives cell (of about fifty or so members) is headed by Rillor Paln, though many within the guild are grumbling quietly about his leadership; he seems more eager to support the goals of [House Kaal](/Organizations/Houses/Kaal.md) than the guild itself.
