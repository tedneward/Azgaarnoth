Stagraven sits at an important juncture: the southern end of the Ravensound, and the southwestern point of the Daw Mountains, it also marks the southern "border" of the Ravenslands and the last point of civilization along the Ravensroad that (more or less) travels down the western coast of Liria before one crosses the Daws to get to Dawsilent.

Stagraven has a chapterhouse of the [Gold Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Gold.md), which also serves as home for any of the other members of the Order; it is well known that the Coppers have a strong presence here, as do the Silver and Steel.
