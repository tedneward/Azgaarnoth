# Merevets ([Almalz](../Nations/Almalz.md))
**Population:** 

**Features:** 

Merevets is a city of religion. The home of the Al'Uman religion in many ways, Merevets serves as the spiritual home for not only the Al'Umans of Almalz, but also of Alalihat and Zabalasa, and as such is often much more populated than its numbers reflect due to all the visitors coming for the various festivals, ceremonies, and rituals that dominate Merevetian life. Most visitors here are greeted carefully; Al'Uman hospitality must be carefully balanced against the impropriety of inviting a stranger into the home where they might cause trouble of some form; Merevets is filled with stories of visitors from Alalihat or Zabalasa seeking to "convert" or "persuade" those "infidels" they find in the streets or even in the homes of their hosts.

## Geography

## Authority Figures
The Sultan of Merevets (name **TODO**) is carefully neutral in all political affairs, and prefers to follow in his family's footsteps of quiet contemplative meditation of religious affairs. Nominally the head of the Al'Uman religious world, the Caliph realizes that his command over Al'Uman religious dictates is only as far as the Caliphs of Alalihat and Zabalasa allow, and as such he takes great care to remain neutral in everything he can manage to remain neutral to.
