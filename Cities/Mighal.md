The Free City of Mighal is the capital of [Mighalia](/Nations/Mighalia/md), though most just use the name Mighal to refer to the city and its surrounds. An open city of magic and the home to most of the world's mage schools, it is also home to numerous merchant guilds and mercenary companies, and likely a number of other more shadowy organizations.

The current Duke of Mighal enjoys good relations with his distant cousins in Liria, but espionage and intrigue are always at work, and Liria would not hesitate to bring its errant city back under control if given the opportunity.

It is said that anything can be found in the Poor Quarter of Mighal, legal or otherwise, if the price is right. It is also said that almost a third of the population in the Poor Quarter is an agent in the employ of the Dread Emperor, or a spy for the Hordes, or any of a dozen other wild ideas. The city generally tries to ignore the Poor Quarter as best it can, and the City Watch spends as little time there as possible.
