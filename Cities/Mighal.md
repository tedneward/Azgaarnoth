# Mighal
The Free City of Mighal is the capital of [Mighalia](/Nations/Mighalia/md), though most just use the name Mighal to refer to the city and its surrounds. An open city of magic, it is also home to numerous merchant guilds and mercenary companies, and likely a number of other more shadowy organizations.

The current Duke of Mighal enjoys good relations with his distant cousins in Liria, but espionage and intrigue are always at work, and Liria would not hesitate to bring its errant city back under control if given the opportunity.
