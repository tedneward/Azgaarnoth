# Veekz ([Ulm](../Nations/Ulm.md))
*Population: 17,000 -- 65% Hordes, 15% human, 10% Firstborn, 15% Created*

**Facilities:** Port, Citadel, Walled, Marketplace, Shantytown

Veekz is the lone city of the Ulmhorde on the Tragekian continent, and despite its precarious military position, finds itself growing year after year as disaffected Hordish flock there year after year--some disaffected with the United Hordes, some disaffected with the leadership of the Ulmhorde, and some just disaffected with life in general. It is a dark, violent, nearly-lawless city, yet so long as both Tragekia and Ulm find it useful, neither party wishes to see it change its *status quo*.

## Military Units

## Dueling Colleges
Veekz is filled with different dueling colleges, many of which are outright gladiatorial pits filled with slaves: prisoners taken on raids, the politically inconvenient, lawbreakers, the pitmasters generally aren't picky.

## Great Houses
Veekz's connection to nobility is tenuous and thin--a single House maintains its presence here, and 

## Mage Schools
Veekz has a number of mage schools here, many of which would be illegal or forced to operate in secret.

## Merchant Guilds
Almost no legitimate guild will trade here, as the proximity to battle lines between the United Hordes and the Ulmhorde puts any consistant mercantile traffic under deep threat: both the Ulm and Tragekian navies are prone to seize merchants' cargos and crew on a whim.

## Religions
Most of the temples here are Pantheonic, with heavy emphasis on traditional Hordish gods and "the old ways". Most will not openly practice blood sacrifice, but many rituals performed in the temples often have "questionable" elements to them, and participants' perspectives or motivations are never examined too closely.



## Rogues' Guilds
Veekz is rumored to be ruled directly by rogues' guilds, that each of the five figures in power are secretly (or not-so-secretly) members of a guild. Anyone who speaks openly about this within the city boundaries has a tendency to disappear, however.
