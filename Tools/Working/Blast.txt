If the connection is successful, the other circle glows with activation and the creature that initiated the connection can choose one of the following options, which is made known to the receiver before the request is accepted (usually by the way the circle glows, pulsates, or sounds).
* The creatures at either end can hear whatever sounds originate from within 10 feet of the circles at either end. If harmful sounds or vibrations would be transmitted between the circles, the transmission fails and the spell ends.

If harmful sounds or vibrations would be transmitted between the circles, the transmission fails and the spell ends.The connection can be ended by creatures as a bonus action at either end with a spoken password or mental command given while standing on a circle, at which point the spell ends. If there are no creatures in a circle for more than 1 minute, the spell ends.If this spell is cast as a ritual, the required cost of the material component increases to 200 gp (doubled every time 5 feet is added to the radius - ex. 800 gp for 20-ft. radius), and the circle becomes permanently active (but only glows when used).

A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the vortex and is hurled 4d6 × 10 feet away from it in a random direction.Nonmagical fires in the affected area are extinguished and unattended liquids are frozen.
