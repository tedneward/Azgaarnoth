Invisible destructive energy springs silently forth
from you in a direction you choose, destroying
natural life in a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide
and leaving a path of ash in its wake. Creatures of
your choice within the area must make a
Constitution saving throw, taking 3d8 necrotic
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead
or constructs.
Magical plants or creatures of the beast, fey, or
plant types damaged by this spell take additional
force damage equal to the necrotic damage. Any
nonmagical plant in the spell's area that isn't a
creature, such as a tree or shrub, doesn't make a
saving throw, it simply withers and dies. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the necrotic
damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
3rd.
