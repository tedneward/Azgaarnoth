You create a 20 foot by 20 foot wall of black energy.
As you approach the wall it becomes freezing cold
and the warmth seems to be leeched from your
bones. A creature that comes into contact with the wall must make a Constitution saving throw. They
take 4d10 necrotic damage on a failed save and half
as much on a successful one. In addition, anyone
who fails the save cannot take any reactions for 1
minute. It can repeat the Constitution save at the
end of each of its turns to act normally.
