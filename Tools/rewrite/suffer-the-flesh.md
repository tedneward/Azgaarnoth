#### Suffer the Flesh
*2nd-level transmutation* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a set of flensing knives)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You can sacrifice your own flesh to power your
spells. For the duration, for every 10 hit points you
channel into the spell the spell is cast as if it one
level higher. For example, while this spell is in
effect, you cast a fireball as a 3rd level spell, you
could channel 10 hit points to cast fireball as a 4th
level spell, 20 hit points to cast is as a 5th level spell,
etc. Channeling hit points into a spell lowers both
your current hit point total and your hit point
maximum. Your hit point maximum returns to
normal after a long rest.
