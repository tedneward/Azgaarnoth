A shimmering, translucent mace appears in your
hand. You can use it to smite your enemies or intercept hostile magic. You can use the mace in
melee, on a successful attack the mace deals force
damage equal to 3d8 plus your spellcasting ability
modifier.
If you are targeted by, or included in the area of,
an enemy spell of third level or lower you can
absorb the spell with the mace. Doing so destroys
the mace. This cancels the spell's effect on you, but
not on anyone else who is in the spell's area of
effect.
At Higher Levels. You can cast this spell using a
4th level or higher spell slot. You inflict plus 1d8
force damage for every spell level above 3rd.
