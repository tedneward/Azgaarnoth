You take control of the shadow belonging to a creature to restrain its master. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature that you can see within range, dealing 2d6 necrotic damage and grappling the target. The grappled creature can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (creature's choice) against your spellcasting DC, ending the spell if successful. You are not able to control a target's shadow in this manner if the target is in bright light.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
