You assume the form of a [vampire](/Creatures/Vampire.md) until the next dawn, or the spell's duration, whichever happens first. You transform into an average vampire, one without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.

Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of a vampire, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores if they are greater. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of a vampire. If the vampire has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the vampire's bonus in place of yours. You cannot use its Legendary Resistance or its legendary actions in the new form. As a vampire, you do not age.

You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your vampiric form is physically capable of doing so. You can speak all of the languages you knew before the transformation.

When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground or is worn by your new form. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the vampire's shape and size compared to those of your original form. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must fall to the ground. During this spell's duration, you cannot end the spell prematurely.

You can assume your vampiric form permanently by casting this spell and drinking from the same chalice every day for 10 days. During the night of the 10th consecutive casting of this spell, you must feed on blood from a living humanoid creature to complete your  transformation.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, you gain one use of the vampire's Legendary Resistance per day. To gain this effect permanently by casting this spell and drinking from the same chalice every day for 10 days, each casting must be done using a 9th level spell slot.
