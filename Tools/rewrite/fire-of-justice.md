You must cast this spell after you have successfully
hit a creature and inflicted damage upon it in melee
combat, or the spell fails. If the creature is still in
range and some of the damage you inflicted remains
unhealed, you can cast this spell, and its wounds
burst into flames and engulf it; The target must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
it takes 6d10 fire damage, and it catches on fire,
shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim
light for another 30 feet. At the end of each of its
turns, the creature repeats the saving throw. It takes
3d10 fire damage on a failed save, or the spell ends
on a successful one.
When dealing damage to an undead creature
with this spell, reroll any 1 on a damage die.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the initial
fire damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level
above 5th.
