---
You lash out at a creature, searing its flesh with the spiteful fires that burn in Avernus. Make a melee spell against the target. On a hit, the target takes 10d12 fire damage, and it is branded with the mark of Zariel that is fueled by combat and suffering for 1 minute. While branded, each time the creature takes critical damage from an attack, the critical damage is doubled.
