For the duration, you drawn upon the malice of The Whispered One to grant you dark powers. Your eye transforms, taking on a golden hue with a slit pupil like that of a cat. It glows green in the darkness and grants you True Sight out to a range of 30 feet.

Additionally, your hand begins to wither, leaving a blackened, mummified appendage that can be used to inflict terrible pain. For the duration, as an action on your turn, you can make a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of you, dealing 6d6 cold damage and 6d6 necrotic damage on a hit. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as your hand draws the life force from its body. Your eye and hand return to normal when the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. Casting this spell every day with a 9th level spell slot for a year makes its effects permanent and your alignment becomes Neutral Evil if it is not already.
