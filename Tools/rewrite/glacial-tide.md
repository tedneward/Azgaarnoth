You emit a massive beam of freezing cold, ice, and water in a line 500 feet long and 25 feet wide that blasts away all in its deadly path. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11d10 cold damage and 11d10 force damage, is pushed 50 feet away from you, and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed or knocked prone.

Until the end of your next tum, the area is difficult terrain for those who cannot navigate snow or ice.

The spell damages and pushes objects in the area. The ice, snow, and water vanish when the spell ends.
