#### Spellsteal
*7th-level enchantment* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a white glove)
- **Duration:** 1 minute, or until dispelled
---
The target creature must make a successful Intelligence saving throw, or lose one spell slot from its highest available slots – up to 6th level – which you temporarily gain as a spell slot for the duration, or until you use the stolen spell slot to cast a spell. This temporary spell slot does not count against your maximum number of spell slots available.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the maximum level of the spell slot that you can steal from the target increases by 1 for each slot level above 7th.
