You spit an oath at a creature within range, who must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 5d12 necrotic damage. They take half as much on a successful save.

Additionally, on a failed saving throw, the creature is frightened of you and is incapacitated. The creature also takes 2d12 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns, after which it may make the saving throw again. On a success, the spell ends.
