#### Manacle of Burden
*2nd-level conjuration* (Pale Master,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You target two creatures that are within 20 feet of each other within range and cause them to make a Strength saving throw with disadvantage. If both targets fail, they are bound to one another by a spectral manacle of your creation and will split all damage done to them.

For the duration, any damage done to either target is halved (rounded down) and then dealt to the other bound creature as well.

If the two bound creatures move more than 20 feet apart, the manacle breaks causing 4d6 necrotic damage to each target.
