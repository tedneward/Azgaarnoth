While pressing your attack, you fortify yourself
against whatever your quarry throws at you. For the
duration, while a creature is marked by you (such as
with a spell like hunter's mark  or marshal's mark , or
with another marking effect like the Unwavering
Mark feature of the Knight martial archetype), you
have advantage on saving throws that creature
forces you to make. Whenever you hit a creature
marked by you with an attack, you gain temporary
hit points eqaul to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability
modifier.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a 5th-level or higher spell slot, that number of
temporary hit points you gain for hitting a creature
marked by you increases by 1d4 for each slot level
above 4th.
