You channel elemental heat from the Plane of Fire

handle it without any ill effect. For the duration, the
stone emits bright light for 15 feet and dim light for
15 feet beyond that.
You may throw the sunstone at a target you can
see in range, and the sunstone moves around any
obstacles between it
and its target.
Make a
ranged spell attack, ignoring cover. If you hit the
target takes 3d10 fire and 3d10 bludgeoning damage.
Whether the stone hits or misses it returns to you.
For the duration, you can use a bonus action to
launch the stone at another target. When the spell
ends the stone shatters.
