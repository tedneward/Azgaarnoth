#### Boulder Bombardment
*8th-level conjuration* (Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a quartz crystal embedded in rock)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You bombard a 60-foot tall by 30-foot radius
cylindrical area within range with falling boulders.
Any creature caught in the spell's area takes 12d6
bludgeoning damage and is buried under 5 feet of
rubble. A successful Dexterity saving throw halves
the damage and avoids burial. Any creature buried
under the rubble is restrained but can use an action
on its turn to make a DC 20 Strength check to free
itself.
A buried creature that fails the Strength check to
free itself is restrained and trapped until help
arrives. At least one person digging through the
rubble can free a trapped creature in 1 minute.
