#### Thunder Riposte
*6th-level evocation* (Cleric,Warlock)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take in response to being hit with an attack roll by a creature within 5 feet of you
- **Range:** Self (15 foot cone)
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
As part of the reaction used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
the creature that made the triggering attack,
otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers
the attack's normal effects and each creature in a 15-
foot cone emanating from you must make a
Constitution saving throw as your weapon
unleashes a devastating blast of thunder. The cone
must include the creature that made the triggering
attack. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8
thunder damage and falls prone. On a successful
save, the creature takes half as much damage and
doesn't fall prone.
The sound of this spell can be heard up to 500
feet away (or farther with a successful Wisdom
(Perception) check as determined by your DM).
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the thunder
damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
6th.
