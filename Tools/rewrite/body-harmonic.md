#### Body Harmonic
*5th-level transmutation* (Bard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a water-filled crystal goblet worth at least 500 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You rub the crystal goblet while chanting a poetic
verse, and it begins to resonate with an earsplitting
tone. Choose a creature within range as your target;
the piercing tone wracks the target's body with painful vibrations, and it must make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
3d10 thunder damage and has disadvantage on
ability checks and saving throws with one ability
score of your choice until the end of its next turn.
The creature must make a new Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with the
effects described above happening on a failed save.
This is repeated every round until the spell ends.
