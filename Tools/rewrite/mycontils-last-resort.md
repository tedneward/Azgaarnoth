___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius sphere)

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You unleash deadly explosive power, like the effects
of the retributive strike created by breaking a staff
of power or staff of the magi . The spell converts any
unexpended spell slots you have into a blast of
magical energy, releasing your arcane power in an
explosion that expands to fill a sphere with a 30-foot
radius centered on you.
When the staff explodes, you have a 50% chance
to avoid the explosion by instantly transporting to a
random plane of existence. However, if you are not
transported, then you take force damage equal to 16
× the number of unexpended spell slots you had when you cast the spell.
In addition, each creature in the sphere's radius
when the blast occurs must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount
of damage based on how far it is from the blast's
point of origin, as described below. On a successful
saving throw, a creature takes half damage.
All creatures within 10 feet of you when the blast
occurs take force damage equal to 8 × the number
of unexpended spell slots you had when you cast
this spell. Likewise, creatures between 11 and 20 feet
away from you take force damage equal to 6 × the
number of unexpended spell slots you had when
you cast this spell. Finally, creatures between 21 and
30 feet away from you take force damage equal to 4
× the number of unexpended spell slots you had
when you cast this spell.
