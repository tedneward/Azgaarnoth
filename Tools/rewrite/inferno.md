You ignite a wildfire to scorch the battlefield, centered on one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage and burn uncontrollably. At the start of each of its turns, the target must make another Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 fire damage. A successful saving throw ends the spell.

While the spell is active, if the target takes fire damage from any source other than this spell, each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried. This effect can only occur once per round.

***At Higher Levels:*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both damage rolls increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
