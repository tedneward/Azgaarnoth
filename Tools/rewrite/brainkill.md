*4th-level enchantment* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 50 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
Choose one target within range, which must make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes
a -20 penalty on the roll for its next ability check
before the spell ends.
Once the target takes that penalty on an ability
check, until the spell ends, the target must repeat
the Wisdom saving throw any time it would make
an ability check. On a failure, its roll for that ability
check suffers the same -20 penalty.
If the target succeeds on the Wisdom saving
throw three times, the spell ends.
