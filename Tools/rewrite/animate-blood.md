#### Animate Blood
*6th-level necromancy* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You deal yourself 1 slashing or piercing damage to
yourself to shed some blood, which you animate
into a tiny humanlike construct called a bloodling.
Bloodlings look like tiny humanoids made out of
dark red wax. Bloodlings are tiny, they have a speed
of 40 feet, an AC 18, 5 hp, and darkvision out to 60
feet. They are ineffective in combat but have +10 to
Dexterity (stealth) checks. They are too weak to
carry anything that weighs more than 5 pounds.
As long as the bloodling is within 120 feet you can
use an action to look through the bloodling's eyes
and give it telepathic commands. You can specify a
bloodling. The bloodling will take whatever actions
you command it to and nothing else.
When you cast a spell with a range of touch, the
bloodling can deliver the spell as if it had been the
caster. The bloodling must be within 120 feet of you,
and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when
you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you
use your attack modifier for the roll. Whether or
not the spell is successful, when you have a
bloodling deliver a spell in this way, your animate
blood spell ends and the bloodling is destroyed.
