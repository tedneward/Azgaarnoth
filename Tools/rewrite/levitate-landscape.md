---
You bury a gemstone 1 foot below the surface and begin to enchant the surrounding area with magical energies native to the Elemental Plane of Air. After a strenuous casting recital consisting of 8 hours of uninterrupted devotion, the landscape begins to tear away from its surroundings up to a 250-foot-radius sphere in any direction from the gemstone, forming an island.

Once the spell has been completed, the island begins to lift into the air at a rate of 100 feet per 1 hour. You are able to use your action to stop the island from elevating at any point up to 1 mile above the surface. Once stopped, you are able to move the island by spending 1 hour in an uninterrupted recitation. Doing so will allow you to move the island in any direction at a rate of 20 feet per 1 hour. You may stop the island from moving at any time using your action. The buried gemstone can never be higher than 1 mile above the surrounding ground's surface. Removing the gemstone from the place it was buried requires a successful Intelligence (Arcana) and Strength (Athletic) check, each contested by your spell save DC. Succeeding on both checks ends the spell, causing the island to fall back towards the surface at a rate of 192 feet per round.

You may only have one instance of this spell active at a time. Casting the spell again will cause the other casting of this spell to lose its magical properties and the spell will end.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a slot of 9th level, you may have multiple instances of this spell active at a time, and casting the spell again no longer causes previous castings of this spell to end. When you complete the 1-hour recitation to move a Levitated Landscape, you instead move all Levitated Landscapes that you control.
