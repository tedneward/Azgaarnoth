*3rd-level enchantment* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a broken friendship bracelet)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of negative emotion that increases suspicion and doubt. All creatures in the area when the spell is cast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it immediately becomes suspicious of the motivations of all others. A creature can voluntarily fail its saving throw. Affected creatures have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and if under the effects of the charmed condition, they can immediately make a new saving throw with advantage to end that effect. Additionally, affected creatures have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks as their social manner shifts to closed off and guarded.
