There are two possible uses for the spelL granting either immediate or long-term effects.

**Lava.** If you cast this spell using 1 action, the ground within 60 feet of a point that you choose within range is transformed into superheated molten lava that extends 5 feet deep until the spell ends. The lava sheds bright light for 30 feet and dim light for an additional 30 feet beyond that. A creature walking on the lava must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. Each creature that touches the lava for the first time on a turn must make a Dexterity saving throw, unless it is already restrained by the lava. On a failed save, it takes 8d8 fire damage and is restrained by the lava. On a success, it takes half damage and it isn't restrained.

Each creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the lava or enters that area for the first time on a turn takes 4d8 fire damage, or l 2d8 fire damage if it is restrained by the lava. When a restrained creature ends its turn, it sinks into the lava. In addition, whenever a creature falls prone within the lava or ends its turn while prone within the lava, it takes 8d8 additional fire damage and sinks into the lava. This spell treats creatures that cannot be prone as if they are always prone instead.

A restrained creature can use an action to attempt to escape. It makes a Strength check against your spell save DC, with disadvantage if it has sunk into the lava. On a success, it frees itself and stands atop the lava. 

The lava damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried, and it flows downhill and through holes or channels (at the DM's discretion} When the spell ends, the lava cools and hardens into black obsidian glass. The obsidian is broken wherever a creature would be trapped inside.

**Magma.** If you cast this spell over 1 hour, you call forth magma deep beneath the land The spell's material components are consumed, the ground level rises by twenty feet, and if there is a volcano at your location, it grows taller and stronger. Doing this at the same location once every 30 days for 10 years creates a permanent volcano, topped with a permanent caldera that functions the same as the Lava version of this spell The volcano has a radius of at least 1 mile at its base. It's activity leveL topography, and growth rate are determined by the DM.
