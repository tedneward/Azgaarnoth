#### Hemokinesis
*transmutation cantrip (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)
---
You choose an area of liquid blood that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You cannot affect the blood in a creature unless it is dead. You manipulate the blood in one of the following ways:

* You cause the blood to bubble and froth, creating the strong scent of blood in the air. This smell reaches 60 feet out in all directions from the blood and lasts for 1 hour.
* You cause the blood to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.
* You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the blood as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn't have enough force to cause damage.

Alternatively, you can target one creature of size Medium or smaller that you can see within range and attempt to push the blood in its body, if it has blood. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, you can push the target up to 5 feet in any direction.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than one of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
