#### Aegis of Ensnarement
*3rd-level enchantment* (Paladin,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a creature within range succeeds on a melee attack roll that would hit one of your allies
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
Your magic ensnares an attacking enemy, moving it so its attack targets you instead of your ally. The creature that made the triggering attack roll must roll a Charisma saving throw, which happens before the attack's damage is resolved. On a failed save, you teleport it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. It then makes the triggering attack against you instead, comparing the same attack roll to your Armor Class to determine whether it hits or misses you.

Whether the saving throw succeeds or fails, after the triggering attack is resolved, the attacking creature takes 1d4 psychic damage and you mark it until the end of your next turn. While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you. This spell ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range increases to 60 feet, and the psychic damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.
