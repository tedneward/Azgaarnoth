#### Fire Trap
*4th-level abjuration* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a blown glass sphere)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure an immobile, invisible, 1-foot-radius sphere of force that attracts and absorbs all heat and fire in its vicinity. Any natural or magical fire effect that is produced or passes within 10 feet of the sphere, is immediately drawn into the sphere without manifesting. All fire damage drawn into the sphere is still rolled and/or recorded. Once active, the sphere visibly roils with trapped fire energy. Any fire within the sphere when the spell ends, either by ceasing concentration or reaching duration, is harmlessly shunted to the elemental plane of fire. The sphere can absorb an amount of fire damage equal to five times your wizard level. If the capacity of the sphere is exceeded before ended by you, it explodes in a 20-foot-radius centered on the sphere, with all creatures, objects, and structures in the area taking fire damage equal to the total of the sphereâ€™s holding capacity.
