#### Prismal's Wormhole
*8th-level conjuration* (Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 2 hours
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a door knocker)
- **Duration:** Until discharged
---
While casting this spell, you designate one creature
as the caller and tell it a command word that is used
to activate the wormhole. The caller may discharge
the spell by repeating the command word and
creating the wormhole. Communication and travel
are possible through the wormhole, which has
infinite range and can cross dimensional
boundaries.
Once the caller says the command word, the
caster hears a voice alerting that someone is calling.
The door knocker raises five feet off the ground. By
grasping the door knocker, the caster can open a
portal to the caller. The caster and the caller can
speak through the portal and the caster can look
around without stepping through. Spells can be cast
through the wormhole. The caster can also go
through the wormhole and join the caller. The
caster may collapse the wormhole at will. However,
the wormhole will only last 1 minute per spellcaster
level before collapsing, whether the caster wishes it
or not. If the wormhole remains open, anyone can
pass through.
