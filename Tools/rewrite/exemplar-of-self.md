#### Exemplar of Self
*9th-level enchantment* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a mirror)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You select one creature within range and positively fortify their physical and mental well being to virtually unassailable levels. They become immune to all conditions, and all current, ongoing conditions are ended. All ability checks are automatically successful as their confidence and competence soars to near unattainable heights.

At the end of the spell the affected creature must make a Charisma saving throw or become despondent at the loss of the positive emotion, gaining a level of exhaustion.
