Choose one creature that you can see within range which has blood. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage.

If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, its blood bursts from within its body, spraying nearby foes with gore and spikes of enchanted blood. Each creature within 15 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 3d10 necrotic damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
