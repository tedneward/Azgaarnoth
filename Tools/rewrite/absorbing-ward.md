When you take a single source of damage, you create a protective ward that has 18 hit points. The ward absorbs up to this number of hit points from the attack. 

Once the ward has absorbed damage in this manner, it goes inert until you release it the next time you deal damage. The number of hit points absorbed by the ward is added as force damage to your next attack, spell, or spell-like ability.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the ward gains 6 hit points for every slot level above 3rd.
