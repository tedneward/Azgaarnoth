#### Conjure Wyrmling
*7th-level conjuration* *(ritual)* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (dragon scales and a jewel worth 10,000 gp, both of which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Up to 8 hours
---
You summon a dragon wyrmling of challenge rating 4 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The color of dragon scales used in the casting determines the type of wyrmling summoned. The wyrmling disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The wyrmling is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the wyrmling, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long as they don't violate its alignment. If you don't issue any commands to the wyrmling, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The DM has the wyrmling's statistics. You can only have one wyrmling conjured at a time with this spell. Any additional castings of the spell within the duration will cause the prior wyrmling to cease existing or to extend the duration, depending on the scale used.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using an 8thlevel spell slot, the duration is up to 24 hours. When using a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.
