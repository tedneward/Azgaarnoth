#### Mummify
*3rd-level necromancy* (Cleric,Pale Master,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You touch a humanoid creature and utter an ancient curse. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 4d8 necrotic damage and become restrained as spectral wrappings begin to tighten around its body. Until the spell ends, as an action on each of your turns, you can cause the target to take an additional 2d8 necrotic damage every round after the spell was initially cast. The target can use its action to make a Strength saving throw, breaking the spectral wrappings and ending the spell.

A creature that dies while under the effect of this spell becomes a [mummy](/Creatures/Mummy.md) that is friendly to you and your companions for the remaining duration. Roll initiative for the mummy, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the mummy, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. Once the duration is reached, the mummy dies and turns to ash.

If your concentration is broken, the mummy doesn’t die. Instead, you lose control of the mummy, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and will attack. An uncontrolled mummy can’t be dismissed by you, and it turns to ash 10 minutes after the spell was initially cast.
