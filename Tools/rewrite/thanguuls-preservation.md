#### Thanguul's Preservation
*5th-level necromancy* (Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a candle made of rare wax worth 1000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You light the candle and deposit some of your hit
points inside. You cannot deposit more hit points
that you currently have. Depositing hit points into
the candle lowers your current hit point total and
your maximum hit points by the amount you have
deposited in the candle. If you are reduced to 0 hit
points, the candle melts and you regain the hit
points you have deposited in the candle. Your
maximum hit point total also increases by the
number of hit points you regain from the candle.
You may only be under the effects of one
Thanguul's Preservation at a time. You and the
candle must be on the same plane when you are
reduced to 0 hit points or the spell fails. If the
candle is destroyed before you are reduced to 0 hit
points, your hit point total increases by the number
of hit points you deposited inside the candle, but
you do not regain any hit points. As long as you
have hit points deposited in the candle, it will
continue to burn, but will not use any fuel. The
candle sheds bright light out to 5 feet and dim light
5 feet beyond that.
