---
A transparent alicorn (unicorn horn) forms about 2 inches from your brow. Starting the turn you cast this spell, for the duration you can use a bonus action during each of your turns to launch the horn at a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 radiant damage on a failed save. It is also outlined in silver faerie fire on a failed save, causing any attacks against it to be made with advantage until the start of your next turn. On a successful save the target takes half as much radiant damage, but suffers no other effects. Once the alicorn is launched, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of radiant damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
