#### Furtive Armory
*4th-level conjuration* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (An exquisite weapon rack, 10 feet wide by 6 feet tall, constructed from rare materials worth at least 6,000 gp, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 60 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You hide a weapon rack, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the rack and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The weapon rack can hold 15 pieces of adventuring gear, weapons or armor. While the weapon rack remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the rack. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 10 feet of you. You can send the weapon rack back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the rack and the replica.

After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell's effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica rack is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger weapon rack is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.
