A divine or spiritual figure gives you her blessing, allowing you to summon the mythical spirit of an owl that appears on your shoulder. The owl cannot attack or carry any objects but understands any simple commands you give it up to a mile away. If not given any commands, the owl will sit perched upon your shoulder.

As a bonus action, you are able to see and hear through the perspective of the spirit owl, but you become blinded and deafened while doing so.
