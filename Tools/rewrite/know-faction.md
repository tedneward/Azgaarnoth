#### Know Faction
*1st-level divination* (Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
After socially interacting with a creature for at least
one minute, you can make a Wisdom (Intuition)
check with advantage against a DC of 10 + the
creature's Charisma modifier + its proficiency bonus
to determine its faction affiliation. For example, if
you were interacting with a Harper agent who is a
2nd level bard with a Charisma of 16, you could
make a Wisdom (Intuition) check with advantage
against a DC of 15 to determine that it is a Harper
agent.
The spell's results are inconclusive if the creature
isn't affiliated with a faction.
