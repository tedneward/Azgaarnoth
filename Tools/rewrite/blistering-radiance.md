You create a tiny ball of light that streaks out from
your hand to a point you choose within range. It
bursts into a 50-foot radius sphere, a blistering hot
corona that hovers in place for the duration.
A creature in the area when you cast the spell
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature takes 2d6 fire damage from the
searing heat and is blinded until the end of its next
turn. On a successful save, a creature only takes half
the fire damage, and isn't blinded.
For the duration, any creature that starts its turn
within the corona must make a Constitution saving
throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.  At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
