#### Command Water
*4th-level conjuration* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a water source)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You command a small body of water (at least one barrel-full of water or approximately 200 litres or 52 gallons) to spring to life to do your bidding. The water forms into a water weird (MM p. 299), which comes forth from the water and moves into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of the source. The water weird disappears when it drops to zero hit points, or when the spell ends. The water weird is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the water weird, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the water weird, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the water weird doesn’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the water weird, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.

The DM has the water weird’s statistics.
