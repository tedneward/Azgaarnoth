You raise one corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid as a [revenant](/Creatures/Revenant.md) under your temporary influence.

Once raised, the revenant is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). The revenant is under your control for 24 hours, after which time it stops obeying any command you have given it.

When you cast this spell, you must choose one hostile creature within 1 mile of you on which you wish to seek revenge, and against whom the revenant (for the duration), also swears vengeance. If you do not choose a target for vengeance, the revenant ceases to be under your control.

If you don't issue any commands to the revenant, it attacks the subject of its sworn vengeance, moving toward that creature if it can, and defends itself from hostile creatures. If you cast this spell while you already have a revenant under your control from a prior casting of this spell, the previous spell ends and the existing revenant leaves your service as described above.

The revenant will not seek revenge against you for animating it with this spell. Once this spell ends, however, if you wronged it during its life, or if you have stirred it to vengeance against you by any of the deeds you committed or forced it to commit during its service to you, it may (at the DMâ€™s discretion) make you a target for its vengeance.

If the revenant has vengeance in its heart towards another creature, it will seek revenge against it once your control ends. If the revenant does not burn with the need for vengeance, it becomes a dead corpse once more.

Once a corpse has been the subject of this spell, it cannot be transformed into a revenant again by this spell for 100 years.
