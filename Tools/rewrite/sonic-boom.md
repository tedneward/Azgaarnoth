___

- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A bead of thunderous force rockets from your fingertips toward a point you can see within range, where it explodes into a wave of sound that expands to a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes SdlO thunder damage, it is deafened until the end of your next tum, and it is pushed 20 feet away from the center of the area and knocked prone. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half damage and is not knocked prone, pushed, or deafened.

Unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 20 feet away from the center of the area by the spell's effect.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the thunder damage dealt increases by ldlO and the distance a creature is puched increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.
