---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and it becomes engulfed in a 5-foot square of acidic mist. If the target does not move out of this square by the start of your next turn, it immediately takes 1d8 acid damage, and the spell ends.

This spell’s damage and effected area increase when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the damage is increased by 1d8 and the area covered by the mist is 10 feet in a line away from you, affecting any creatures in the mist at the start of your next turn. Both the damage and area's line increase by 1d8 and 5 feet at 11th level and 17th level.
