You wrap one person you touch in the essence of
the Shadowfell. The creature becomes harder to see
and its body becomes much more malleable. Until
the spell ends, he creature gains advantage on all
Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Whenever it makes such
a check, it is considered proficient in the Stealth
skill. A creature that is already proficient in the
Stealth skill adds double its normal proficiency
bonus to the check, instead of its normal
proficiency bonus. For the duration, the subject of
this spell can also squeeze through any gap larger
than 1-inch wide.
