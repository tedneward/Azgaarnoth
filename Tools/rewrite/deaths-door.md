Just as you slip between the realm of souls and out of consciousness, you shout a call that is something between a new word, an old name, and a primal roar, which echoes with soundless din in your soul and the souls around you.

You are reduced to 1 hit point instead of 0. In addition, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your maximum hit points which disappear when the spell ends. While the spell lasts, you appear translucent, flickering with spectral energy, and you also gain the following benefits:
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt from nonmagical weapons.
* You have a flying speed equal to your speed, and you can hover. You can also use a bonus action on your tum to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
* You grant enemies disadvantage on weapon attacks made against you, and you make all saving throws with advantage except Charisma saving throws, which you make with disadvantage.
* On your turn, you can use your action to strike a target with soul energy. You make a melee spell attack with a reach of Touch against one creature that you can see. On a hit, that creature takes 8d6 damage.
* On your turn, you can use your action to burst with the energy from within your soul forcing all creatures within 15 feet of you to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 5d6 damage.

The type of this spell's damage is determined by your alignment: if you are Good, it deals radiant damage; if you are Evil it deals necrotic damage; and if you are Neutral you may choose either damage type when you cast the spell.
