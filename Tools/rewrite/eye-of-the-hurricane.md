___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (40-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
When you cast this spell, it creates a spherical
storm with hurricane force winds that whip
violently around you in a 40-foot radius sphere
centered on you. However, within a 10-foot radius
sphere also centered on you, these winds are
relatively calm, merely a strong breeze.
Because of the winds, creatures within 40 feet of
you cannot make ranged attack rolls, nor can they
be the targets of ranged attacks. Certain large
projectiles, such as thrown or catapulted boulders,
can be used to attack despite the winds, but even
attacks with such weapons are made at
disadvantage.
Any creature that moves into the area of the
violent winds or starts its turn there must make a
Strength saving throw. If they fail, they suffer one of
the following effects, depending on their size and
whether they are flying. * Medium and smaller creatures are moved 1d4 x
10 feet in a random direction, knocked prone,
and take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for
every 10 feet this effect moves them.
* Medium flying creatures are pushed back 1d6 x
10 feet.
* Large creatures are knocked prone.
* Large flying creatures are pushed 1d6 x 5 feet.
* Huge creatures make no progress through the
winds.
* Huge flying creatures are pushed 1d4 x 5 feet.
You can move at half your movement speed while
concentrating on the storm, and it moves with you.
However, if your movement causes the storm's
winds to cross into a space occupied by another
creature, the creature must make a Strength saving
throw to avoid the spell's effects.
