A gust of wind begins to swirl around a place on the ground that you can see within range, culminating in power. After a brief moment, a wind geyser 10 feet diameter and up to 60 feet tall abruptly shoots into the air. Any medium or smaller creature that steps into the geyser or is in its space when the geyser is created must make a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted into the air to the geyser's peak. Large creatures make their Dexterity save with advantage, and Huge or larger creatures are unaffected.
