#### Veil of Elements
*2nd-level evocation* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small moonstone)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You summon a swirling mass of elements in a 15-foot-radius, 40-foot-tall cylinder centered on a point you can see within range. Each creature that begins their turn in the veil or moves into it during their turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 damage from an element of your choosing (cold, fire, lightning, thunder) on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one, which
expends that damage type from the veil.

The spell ends once all four damage types are expended, or the spell's duration is reached.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage from each element increases 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
