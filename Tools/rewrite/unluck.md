You manipulate what was once an ode to fate,
speaking it in reverse and warping the weave of
fortune. Choose one target within range to make a
Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target
takes 3d6 psychic damage and has disadvantage on
the next attack roll it makes before the end of its
next turn. On a success, the target takes half
damage, but suffers no other ill effects.
In addition, whether the target fails or succeeds on its saving throw, you can choose one ally within
60 feet to gain advantage on the next attack roll it
makes before the end of its next turn.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
