#### Blood Extraction
*3rd-level necromancy* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of blood mixed from ten people)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure a pulsating orb of red energy floating in the air at a point you can see within range. It lasts for the duration and gives off dim light for 20 feet. At the end of each of your turns until the spell ends, each creature other than you within 20 feet of the orb must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 3d6 necrotic damage, or 3d12 necrotic damage if its hit points are less than or equal to half of its maximum hit points. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half damage.

If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this spell the orb collects some of its blood. It cannot collect blood from the same creature twice. When the spell ends, the accumulated blood strengthens you, instantly granting you 1d6 temporary hit points for each creature the orb collected blood from.

Creatures without blood are immune to this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 1d6 and 1d12 respectively for each slot level above 3rd.
