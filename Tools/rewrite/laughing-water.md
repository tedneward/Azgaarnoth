#### Laughing Water
*3rd-level abjuration* (Cleric,Druid,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a stoppered bottle)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You fill the bottle with water, and you enchant it to
become crystal clear. Anyone who drinks the water
during the duration is treated as if they were the
target of a lesser restoration. The side effect is what
gives the spell its name. Anyone that drinks the
potion must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15)
or find everything hysterically funny. The character
becomes prone and incapacitated for one round,
laughing so loudly it is audible out to 50 feet.
