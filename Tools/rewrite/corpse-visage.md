This spell transforms the face of a friendly creature
you touch into the horrifying visage of a rotting
corpse. Any creature with a challenge rating of 1 or
lower viewing it must make a Wisdom saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened
for the duration. The frightened creature can make
another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of
its turns. On a successful save, the spell ends.
