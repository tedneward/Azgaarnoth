___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

Time slows briefly for you or an ally, allowing a
quick burst of movement no one else can perceive.
Choose a creature within range of this spell. That
creature can use its reaction to teleport up to 30 feet
to an unoccupied space. When it arrives, choose a
creature within 5 feet of it, which must make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the teleported
target gains advantage on its next attack roll against
that creature before the end of its next turn.
