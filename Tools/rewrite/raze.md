You summon a fiery floor of bubbling lava below your feet. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 fire damage and may only move up to half of their movement speed until the end of their next turn. Creatures that are within 5 feet of you must make the Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage. Creatures take half damage and do not lose any movement speed on a successful saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the spell increases by 5 feet for every slot level above 4th.
