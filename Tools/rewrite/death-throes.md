As life leaves your body you have one final act of
revenge. If you are slain while this spell is in effect
your body explodes. Everyone within 50 feet must
make a Dexterity save. They take 10d8 fire damage
on a failed save, and half as much on a successful
one. Your body is destroyed and you cannot be
brought back to life by any means short of a true
resurrection or wish.
