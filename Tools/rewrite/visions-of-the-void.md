#### Visions of the Void
*3rd-level illusion* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pickled eyeball)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a 30 foot radius of swirling, disorienting visions from the void. All creatures within the area of effect when the spell is cast, or who start their turn there, must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or have their speed reduced to zero. Creatures perceive they are moving if they attempt to, but seem to find no end to the confusing visions.

Any caster who does not have at least one level of [Voidmancy](/Classes/Wizard/Voidmancy.md) must make a Wisdom save against DC 13, or take 2d6 psychic damage when they cast this spell.
