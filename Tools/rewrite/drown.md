While the spell continues, it takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns.

At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the creature breaks free and the spell ends. Creatures that can breathe water or do not have to breathe automatically succeed on the saving throw.
