*Enchantment cantrip (Sorcerer)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You broadcast a mental image or telepathic message
to nearby allies. Choose any number of non-hostile
creatures within range. These targets (and only the
targets) mentally receive the image or message you
chose to convey. If it is a message, it must be 10
words or fewer. Creatures with Intelligence scores
of 2 or creatures unwilling to have you
communicate with them aren't affected by this
spell. You don't need to share a language with a
creature for it to understand what you convey, but if
you send a message rather than an image, a creature
must understand at least one language in order to
comprehend the message.
