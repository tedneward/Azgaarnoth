Your curse greatly weakens a creature in your
presence. Choose one ability score. One creature of
your choice within range makes a saving throw with that ability score. On a failure, the target has
disadvantage on checks and saving throws with the
chosen ability score. In addition, the target has
disadvantage on attack rolls using the chosen ability
score, and deals only half damage with such attacks
if they are weapon attacks.
At the end of each of the target's turns, it can
make a saving throw against the spell. It makes the
saving throw with the ability score you chose, but
the disadvantage inflicted by this spell does not
affect saving throws against it. On a successful save,
the spell ends.
This spell can also be ended with greater
restoration , or heal.
