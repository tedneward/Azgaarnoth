You summon a storm cloud up to 60 feet above the ground at a point you can see in range. After 1d4 rounds, the clouds produce rain at an alarming rate, dousing everything in a 10-foot radius cylinder below the cloud. The rain extinguishes all non-magical fire within the area immediately.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the cloud up to 30 feet in any direction that does not exceed the spell's range and to a maximum height of 60 feet.
