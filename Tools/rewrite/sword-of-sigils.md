#### Sword of Sigils
*1st-level enchantment* (Paladin,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a slashing or piercing weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You make a wide, swiping arc with the blade you
used in the casting, and it glows red and leaves
symbols from ancient duelling rites burning in the
air above each foe you strike. Choose up to five
creatures you can see within range. Make a melee
spell attack against each target. On a hit, a target
takes 2d6 magical slashing damage, and you mark it
with your sigil until the end of your next turn.
While a creature marked by you with this spell is
within 5 feet of you, it has disadvantage on any
attack roll that doesn't target you. This spell ends
early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if
someone else marks the creature.
