You wreathe yourself in weightless magical armoring crafted from plates of pure radiant or necrotic energy, depending on the divine entity you serve. (This is chosen by the deity, never the caster.) Until the spell ends you gain the following benefits for the duration, depending on the kind of energy the plates take on:

* Attacks made against you have disadvantage.
* Radiant:
    * You shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an extra 20 feet
    * When a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the plates burst with beams of light. The attacker takes 3d6 radiant damage, and other creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take half that damage.
    * You have resistance to necrotic damage.
* Necrotic:
    * You shed deep darkness (counteracting bright light) in a 20-foot radius and darkness (counteracting dim light) for an extra 20 feet.
    * When a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the plates burst with beams of darkness. The attacker takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and other creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take half that damage.
    * You have resistance to radiant damage.

In addition, if you are critically hit before the spell ends, you can use your reaction to end the spell causing  the plates to explode in a protective blast of light (if radiant) or darkness (if necrotic). The attack misses, and the attacker as well as each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn.

When the spell ends, the magical plates vanish.
