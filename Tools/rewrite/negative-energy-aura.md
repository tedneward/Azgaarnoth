You radiate life-stealing negative energy in a 10-foot
radius. Each living creature that starts its turn
within 10 feet of you must make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
1d10 necrotic damage. On a successful save, the
creature takes half as much damage.
An undead creature that starts its turn within 10
feet of you gains 1d10 hit points.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the necrotic
damage dealt to living creatures or the amount of
hit points healed for undead creatures increases by
1d10 for every two slot levels above 4th.
