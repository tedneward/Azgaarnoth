#### Creeping Doom
*7th-level conjuration* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You summon a number of swarms of poisonous
snakes equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
These swarms have maximum hit points. While you
remain within 100 feet of the swarms, you may use a
bonus action to command one swarm to move up to
30 feet or attack an adjacent creature.
You summon each swarm into a space of your
choice within range. You can summon a swarm in
the same space as a creature, and the swarm will
immediately attack. The swarms will not move
unless you command them to move, but will attack
creatures within their reach with-out prompting.
The swarms act on initiative 1, and lose all initiative
ties.
