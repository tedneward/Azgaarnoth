#### Malraz's Dramatic Death
*7th-level illusion* (Bard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are dealt damage
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You are cloaked in an invisibility spell, while an
illusory double dies a horrible, overly dramatic
death. You can decide how your illusory double
dies, and they can make some grunts or wheezes to
try and sell the death, but cannot talk. The illusion will fall to the ground, but cannot move more than
5 feet. The death takes one round, and anyone who
touches the corpse will realize it's an illusion, but
the illusion will not fade away.
The illusion and the invisibility will last until the
end of the spell. The invisibility can be broken the
same way as the 2nd level spell of the same name.
