___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You convert raw materials into products of the same
material. For example, you could fabricate an oar
from a wooden limb, or a shirt from a clump of
wool.
Choose raw materials that you can see within
range. You can fabricate a Medium or smaller object
(contained within a 5-foot cube, or eight connected
2.5 -foot cubes), given sufficient quantity of raw
material. If you are working with metal, stone or
another mineral substance, however, the fabricated
object can be no larger than Small (contained
within a single 2.5-foot cube). The quality of objects
created by this spell is commensurate with the
quality of the raw materials.
Creatures or magic items can't be created by this
spell. You also can't use it to create items that
require a high degree of craftmanship, such as
jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have
proficiency with the type of artisan's tools used to
craft such objects.
