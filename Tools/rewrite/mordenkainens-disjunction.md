#### Mordenkainen's Disjunction
*9th-level enchantment* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You speak an ancient cipher that disrupts all magic
within 30 feet of you. Any spells within range other
than those cast upon yourself are instantly ended as
if by a dispel magic  spell and all unattended magic
items are destroyed, as the magic that holds them
together is unraveled.
In addition, any creature other than you within
range that carries any magic items must make a
Wisdom saving throw for each item carried; a
creature can use its own Wisdom saving throw for
each item, with a bonus equal to 1 plus the item's
maximum bonus, as listed in the Magic Item Power
by Rarity table in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's
Guide. On a failed save, the item is destroyed.
Artifacts and sentient magic items are unaffected
by this spell.
