You touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target's skin has a smooth, scale-like appearance, and its AC can't be less than 18, regardless of what kind of armor it is wearing. Also, the target becomes resistant to a single damage type depending on what type of dragon scale you use: white (cold), red (fire), blue (lightning),black (acid), or green (poison).
