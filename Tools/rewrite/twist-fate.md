You change the roll on the die into your choice of an 18 or a 3, potentially changing the result. This spell affects both rolls under advantage or disadvantage.

If you attempt to alter the saving throw of an unwilling target, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the spell affects it normally. On a successful saving throw, the spell has no effect.
