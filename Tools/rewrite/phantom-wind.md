they are in a strong wind. Torches will go out and
curtains and loose cloth will be buffeted and ripped
from their emplacements if not held by a living
creature. Fog and cloud, both magical and
mundane, are immediately pushed to the edge of
the spell effect. Undead and constructs will be
buffeted and must make a Strength saving throw or
treat all terrain as difficult terrain for the duration.
