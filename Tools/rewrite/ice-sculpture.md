- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
---
You conjure a magical chunk of ice into an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The ice created must be no larger than a 10-foot cube, and the ice must be of a form that you have seen before, though the form need not have been made of ice when you saw it. This spell cannot create complicated machinery with moving parts, such as a clock or firearm. When you cast the spelL you also choose whether the ice is clear and transparent or cloudy and heavily obscured.

The ice has hit points equal to 5d8 + twice your spellcasting modifier (minimum 5 hit points), and its AC is equal to 10 + your spellcasting modifier. It has immunity to cold damage, but it has vulnerability to bludgeoning, fire, and thunder damage. The ice object is destroyed when it reaches 0 hit points or the spell ends.

The ice melts after 2d4 minutes in a hot environment, and only 1 minute in an extremely hot environment.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the hit points of the ice increase by 2d8 for each slot level above 2nd, and the maximum size of the object increases by 5 feet for every 3 slot levels above 2nd.
