- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose must make a Wisdom save. On a failed save, a target takes 6d6 force damage and suffers disadvantage on saving throws vs magical effects until the start of your next turn, or half as much damage and no other effects on a successful one. A creature with magic resistance automatically succeeds the save and the spell deals minimum damage.
