The next time you hit a creature with a weapon
attack before this spell ends, your weapon is
weathed in dark energy that freezes your foe in
terror. The attack deals an extra 1d6 psychic
damage, and if the target is not immune to the
frightened condition, its speed is reduced to 0 until
the end of its next turn. If the attack was an
opportunity attack, the target is also frightened
until the end of its next turn.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
