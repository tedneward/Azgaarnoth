With a word, you begin to glow with a circular aura of swirling light that sears your enemies. Until the spell ends, you shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. In addition, when a creature ends its turn within 10 feet of you, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it takes 4d6 radiant damage, or half as much damage on a success.
