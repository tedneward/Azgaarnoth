___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
When you cast this spell, spectral black scales
appear and form a protective coat all over your
body, while shadowy claws sprout from your
fingers. Attack rolls made against you are made at
disadvantage for the duration. You can use your
spellcasting ability score instead of Strength for the
attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes,
and you can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage
for your unarmed strikes.
Finally, as an action on each of your turns, you
can either project a 30-foot cone of fear, or cast
inflict wounds  as a 3rd-level spell without using a
spell slot. The cone of fear has the same effect as the
fear spell.
