You create a single, sharp metal blade that streaks towards a target within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 piercing damage. This weapon counts as magical weapon for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
