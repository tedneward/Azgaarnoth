You conjure an extradimensional cave that has a
single entrance on the plane from which the spell
was cast. You can only cast this spell on a surface
made of rock or some form of earth within range.
The entry point looks like a dark cave entrance that
is 5 feet wide and 10 feet high. Only those you
designate can enter the cave, and all other creatures
and objects are barred from passing through. Spells
and other magical effects can't extend through the
entry portal or be cast through it. The entry portal is
shut and made invisible behind you when you
enter. You can open it again from your side at will.
You can choose the shape of the cave inside. You
can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere
with a radius of up to 30 feet. It takes the form of a
dark, wet cavern. This area contains enough oxygen
to sustain as many creatures as can fit in the area
for the duration of the spell. Edible fungus grows
along the walls, and condensation drips down one
wall into a pool of fresh, clean water that never
seems to run dry. External conditions such as
weather do not affect the pleasant atmosphere of
the cave, and nothing except the designated
creatures can pass through the portal in either
direction. Until the spell ends, you can command
the interior to become dimly lit or dark.
At the end of the spell's duration, all within the
pocket cave return to the spot where they entered
or else to the nearest open space, if that spot is
occupied.
