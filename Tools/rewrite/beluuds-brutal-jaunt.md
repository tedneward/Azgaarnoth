You leap through space in a blur, smashing into an enemy as you pass between realms. You teleport to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. You can choose up to one creature in a line of radius 5 feet originating at the space you left and ending at the space you teleported to. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed saving throw, the target takes 3d10 force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage and is not knocked prone.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the maximum number of creatures you can target increases by one for each slot level above 2nd.
