restored by greater restoration or similar magic.

on the target as if you had cast it at its lowest
level.

successful Wisdom saving throw, or it can't cast
spells until the end of its next turn.
* On a successful hit, the target is indecisive and
can't use an Attack action on its next turn. * On a successful hit, roll for a random effect on

The blackstaff can be used by any creature
proficient with staffs; However, for the duration, a
creature touching the staff can't cast spells. In

spell, the staff's wielder can make an opportunity
attack against the caster. On a hit, the caster's spell
fails.
