---
One hundred tiny insects cover your body and grant you 100 temporary hit points. Also, you are immune to poisons and diseases for the duration. You gain additional effects depending on how many temporary hit points are remaining:

* 75 or more. You have 3/4 cover.
* 45 or more. You have half cover.

Additionally, once per round, if a single source of damage would remove more than 50 temporary hit points, you can use your reaction to only lose half of the temporary hit points instead. The spell lasts for the duration or when the temporary hit points are depleted, whichever happens first. You can only have one instance of this spell active at a time.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, you gain an additional 20 temporary hit points and the spell lasts for 10 days.
