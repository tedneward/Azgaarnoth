light out to 5 feet, and is always hot. Holding the
coalstone without protection heals 1 point of fire
damage every round. Placing the coalstone in
flammable liquid or material will cause it to
instantly ignite. Placing the coalstone in 5 gallons or
less of water will make the water boil after 1 round.
The coalstone stays lit for 1 year, then it goes out.
You may only have one coalstone active at a time.
