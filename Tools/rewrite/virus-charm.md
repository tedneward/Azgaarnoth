#### Virus Charm
*9th-level enchantment* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a crystal vial worth at least 1,000 gp full of the pus of any magical disease)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
You choose up to five creatures within range, none
of whom can be more than 30 feet away from each
other. Each target must make a Wisdom saving
throw. On a failure, it is charmed by you until the
spell ends or until you or your companions do
anything harmful to it. A creature charmed by this
spell regards you as a friendly acquaintance, and it
feels the need to tell others you should be treated as
a friend. It is also compelled to touch any other
creatures it sees that are hostile to you.
When one of the initial targets becomes
charmed by this spell, the next two creatures it
touches before the spell ends must make the same
Wisdom saving throw, becoming charmed on a
failure and suffering the same effects.
A creature who is charmed after being
touched by one or more of the initial
targets only forces the next creature it
touches to make the Wisdom saving
throw, instead of the next two
creatures.
Creatures who become charmed
by this spell after being touched by
a creature that was not one of the
initial targets do not force any
creatures they touch to make the
saving throw. No more than 25 creatures can be
charmed by a single casting of this spell.
