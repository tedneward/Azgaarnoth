A creature afflicted by vertigo suffers the following effects:
* It has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks.
* Its speed is reduced to 10 feet, and it cannot fly or climb, regardless of its abilities.
* It cannot make more than one weapon attack each turn, regardless of its abilities.
* It takes maximum damage from falls.
* It automatically fails all Dexterity saving throws, Dexterity ability checks, and saving throws made to avoid falling prone, except those caused by this spell.
* Attacks made against it have advantage, and score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.
* At the beginning and end of each of its turns, if it is  standing, it must make a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed saving throw, it falls prone.
