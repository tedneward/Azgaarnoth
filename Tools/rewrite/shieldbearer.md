You touch a shield, and it hovers and moves to
protect a target you choose within range. For the
duration, shield hovers within the chosen creature's
space and provides it with the same bonus to Armor
Class it would grant if the creature were using it
proficienctly. Once the shield's recipient has been
chosen, it cannot be changed for the duration of the
spell.
If the creature you choose to protect with this
spell moves more than 60 feet away from you, the
spell ends early. When the spell ends, the floating
shield falls gently to the ground at the chosen
creature's feet.
