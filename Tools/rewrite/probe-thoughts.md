Your target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it
fails, its mind opens itself to you. You gain access to
all of its memories and knowledge, even things the
target has buried deep in its subconscious. You may
learn the answer to one question per round. Your
question and the answer are conveyed
telepathically, and you do not need to speak the
same language. Creatures with an Intelligence less
than 3 may only answer in mental pictures.
The target is not aware of the probe unless you
wish it to be. If the target resists the probe successfully, they know that someone has tried to
cast a spell on them, but not what the spell was nor
who cast it.
