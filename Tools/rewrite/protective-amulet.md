Before you can cast this spell, you must create an
amulet. You can crush the amulet to become
immune to a spell that just targeted you or includes
you in its area of effect. The spell effects other
targets within its area of effect normally.
The amulet you create must be worth 100 gp per
spell level you wish to effect. For example, if you
want to create an amulet that can ward you against
a 3rd level or lower spell, you must spend 300 gp to
create the amulet. Creating the amulet takes 1 day
for every 100 gp you spend. During that day you
must spend 8 hours making the amulet. If you miss
more than two days during that time, the amulet
and gold are destroyed and you must start over
again.
