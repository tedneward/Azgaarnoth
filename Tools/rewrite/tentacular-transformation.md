#### Tentacular Transformation
*6th-level transmutation* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (a dried tentacle from an octopus)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
Two 10-foot long green tentacles sprout from the
right and left sides of your body. For the duration,
you can use the tentacles to grab and manipulate
objects and aid in your attempts to climb. You have advantage on your Strength checks to climb any
surface for the duration.
Additionally, you can attack with the tentacles. If
you take the Attack action on your turn, you can
make a melee spell attack with one of the tentacles,
and then use a bonus action to make an additional
melee spell attack with the other tentacle against a
target within 10 feet of you. On a hit, a tentacle
deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your
spellcasting ability modifier and the creature is
grappled. A grappled creature can attempt to break
free by using its action to make a Strength saving
throw. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to
constrict grappled creatures, automatically dealing
the bludgeoning damage again.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 8th level, the bludgeoning damage
increases to 2d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
