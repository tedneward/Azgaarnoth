---
You touch a creature, causing its heart to fill with a vile poison. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage. At the end of each of the targetâ€™s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take an additional 2d10 poison damage.

At any point during the spell, if the target dies as a result of the poison damage from this spell, every creature within 5 feet of the target must make a Constitution saving throw as the target's heart explodes. A creature takes 4d10 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels:*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, all damage dealt from spell increases by 1d10 for every slot level above 3rd.
