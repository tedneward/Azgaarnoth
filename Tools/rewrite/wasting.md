#### Wasting
*8th-level necromancy* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (dirt from the grave of a ghost)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Your touch ages your victim, turning them into a
haggard shell of who they were. Make a melee spell
attack. If you hit your target ages 10d10 years. The
shock to the system is powerful, and the target must
make a Constitution saving throw or be knocked
unconscious. A victim that is aged more than 70
years must make a Constitution saving throw, dying
if they fail. Victims of this spell will continue to age
normally, most dying within a few days or weeks.
Undead and constructs are immune to this spell.
Extraplanar creatures may age, but automatically
pass the Constitution saving throw. Dragons
automatically pass the Constitution saving throw
and can, at the DM's discretion, become more
powerful because of it.
