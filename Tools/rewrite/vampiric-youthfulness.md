___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Make a melee spell attack. If you hit you drain your
opponent's life and vitality and use them to restore
yours. Your target takes 6d10 necrotic damage and
must make a constitution saving throw. On a
failure, your body becomes the physical age of your
opponent's, and vice-versa. This aging/de-aging is
permanent. It can only be undone by a wish, divine
intervention, or another casting of this spell.
