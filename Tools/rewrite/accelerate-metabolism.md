When you finish casting this spell, you light the
incense and then touch one target creature to
accelerate the vital energies within it. The target
must begin a short rest within one minute,
otherwise the spell fails. At the end of the short rest,
the target regains the maximum number of hit
points for each Hit Die spent. In addition, the
recipient can make a saving throw for each poison
or disease affecting it. On a successful save, the
target recovers from that poison or disease.
