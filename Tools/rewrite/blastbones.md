This spell must be cast on an exposed skeleton
within range. It cannot be cast on the bones of a
living creature if they are still a part of its body, but the spell can be cast on an undead skeleton. The
targeted set of bones explodes, dealing 2d4 + 2
piercing damage to creatures within a 10-foot radius
of it.
If you cast this spell on an undead skeleton, the
skeleton must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the
skeleton fails the save, it takes additional force
damage equal to the amount of piercing damage the
spell inflicts when the bones detonate.
When you cast this spell, you can choose whether
to detonate the bones immediately or delay the
blast for up to one hour. If you choose to delay the
blast, then you can set certain conditions
word that will cause the bones to explode.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of
piercing damage is increased by 1d4 + 1 for each slot
level above 2nd. If you cast it using a spell slot of
4th level or higher, the maximum length of the
optional delay increases to 4 hours. If the spell slot
is 6th level or higher, it increases to 8 hours. If the
slot is 8th level or higher, it increases to 24 hours.
