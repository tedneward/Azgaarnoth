#### Windlance
*5th-level evocation* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You and every creature within range are launched
into the air by a powerful burst of wind. You cannot
avoid being launched into the air, but other
creatures can make a Strength saving throw to stay
on the ground. Creatures that fail the Strength
saving throw are sent 70 feet into the air, and are
likely to fall immediately after and take falling
damage unless they have another means of staying
aloft. If a ceiling prevents a creature affected by this
spell from reaching the maximum height, it takes
1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it traveled
up before hitting the ceiling up.
As part of the action of casting this spell, a druid
can also use the Wild Shape feature (it is usually
used to transform into a flying creature).
