#### Grim Scythe
*Transmutation cantrip (Pale Master,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of hay seed and a quarterstaff)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
For the duration, a spectral blade forms on the end of a quarterstaff you touch. While this blade lasts, you use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of two-handed melee attacks. The weapon also becomes magical if it isn't, it deals necrotic damage instead of bludgeoning, and its damage die becomes a d10. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.
