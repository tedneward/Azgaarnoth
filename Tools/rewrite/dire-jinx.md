---
You incant and point at one creature you can see within range, cursing it with a premonition of fatally bad luck. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target is cursed until the spell ends. While affected by this curse, it suffers the following ailments:

* It takes maximum damage from all traps, environmental hazards (such as a pit of lava} falls, and collisions.
* It has disadvantage on all saving throws, ability checks, and attack rolls that it makes.
* All attacks made against it have advantage and score a critical hit on a roll of 16-20.

A creature cursed by this spell must make another Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell two times, the spell ends. If it fails saves three times, it stops making saving throws against this curse. In addition, if you maintain concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the spell ends and the target becomes affected by a new curse with different effects. This new curse lasts for 30 days.

While affected by this new long-lasting curse, the DM must roll a ld20 for the target at each sunrise. On a 1, the target will meet with a dangerous encounter that day. Examples: Falling off a steep cliff into choppy rapids; meeting drunken and angry bandits when out alone; being mistaken for a wanted criminal and taken for execution; experiencing a terrible magical accident in an academy or laboratory, etc.

The encounter must have a total effective experience value equal to or greater than an encounter with a creature of challenge rating equal to the target's level or challenge rating + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum rating of 6} but it doesn't have to be one that grants any actual experience.

At the end of the 30 days, the target repeats the Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the long-lasting curse remains for another 30 days and then the target repeats the saving throw again. On a success, the curse is removed.
