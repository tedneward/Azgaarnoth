#### Life's Grace
*5th-level abjuration* (Artificer,Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You touch a living creature and ward it against
death magic for a time. For the spell's duration, the
subject gains resistance to necrotic damage and
advantage on saving throws against effects that
would reduce its hit point maximum (such as the
bite of a vampire) or kill it instantaneously without
dealing damage (such as the wail of a banshee). In
addition, when the subject would fail a saving throw
an undead creature forces it to make, it can choose
to succeed instead, and the spell ends.
