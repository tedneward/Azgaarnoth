You place a divine ward with three charges on a creature of your choice that you can see within range. After the target takes damage, it regains hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and the ward loses one charge. 

Once the target is healed, the ward jumps up to 30 feet to another creature of your choice. After the ward loses all of its charges, the spell ends. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the ward gains one additional charge for each slot level above 3rd.
