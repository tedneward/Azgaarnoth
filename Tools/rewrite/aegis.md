You create a protective tether to your allies, strengthing your durability as you endure their pain for 1 minute. Select up to 6 willing creatures within range. For each creature you select, you gain damage resistance to a damage type of your choice. You can choose acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, lightning, piercing, poison, slashing, or thunder. For the duration, any damage to one of creatures selected when casting the spell is transferred to you instead. The spell ends early if you die.
