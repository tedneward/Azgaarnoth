You cause four trees to magically sprout at points on the ground you can see within range, growing upward and forming cages with their branches. Each creature in a space where a tree sprouts must make a Dexterity saving throw.

On a failed saving throw, a creature is trapped by the branches of the tree as it rises into the air. They are lifted up to 20 feet into the air, grappled by the tree until the spell ends, and restrained while they are grappled in this way. The escape DC is equal to your spellcasting DC. On a successful saving throw, a creature moves up to 5 feet to an unoccupied space adjacent to the newly sprouted tree.

You can choose to grow individual trees to lift targets less than 20 feet but no less than 5 feet up. The tops of the trees, including the spaces of grappled targets, are lightly obscured by leaves, and grappled targets have cover from the branches. The trunks have a diameter of 3 feet, and the trees can be climbed with a DC 12 Athletics check.

The insides of the branches have poisonous thorns. When a grappled target makes a weapon attack or fails an attempt to escape the grapple, they must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 poison damage on a failed save. A creature can only take this damage once per turn.

When the grapple ends on a target, they fall if they cannot fly or climb the tree using a climbing speed. The trees last until the spell ends, even with no prisoners inside. When the spell ends, the trees disintegrate into leaves, soil and slime.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can conjure one additional tree for each slot level above 5th.
