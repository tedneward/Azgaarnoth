You invoke primal rage from within the earth itself,
sheathing yourself and your weapon in burning
magma and radiating wrath that scorches your foes.
Until the spell ends, you gain resistance to fire
damage and to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing damage, and your melee weapon
attacks inflict an additional 1d8 fire damage.
As a bonus action on each of your turns until the
spell ends, you can cause your volcanic rage to boil
over, forcing creatures within 5 feet of you to make
a Constitution saving throw. They take 2d6 fire
damage and 2d6 bludgeoning damage if they fail
the saving throw, or half as much on a success.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the fire damage
and bludgeoning damage you can inflict with a
bonus action increase by 1d6 for each slot level
above 6th.
