You summon a comforting spirit of the sacred
hearth, which manifests as a pillar of flame that
burns enemies but soothes you and your allies.
Choose a space within range. That space is filled
with a pillar of sacred fire. The pillar is 10 feet tall
and has a 5-foot radius. Any creature in that space
must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, a creature takes 3d6 fire damage, or half as
much damage on a success. A creature must also
make the saving throw when it enters that space for
the first time on its turn or ends its turn there.
Whenever a creature that fails its saving throw
takes fire damage from this spell, friendly creatures
of your choice within 5 feet of the damaged creature
regain hit points equal to half the amount of fire
damage dealt.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the fire damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
