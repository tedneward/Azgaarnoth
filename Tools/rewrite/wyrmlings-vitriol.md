- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
---
You touch a creature and bestow it with the ability to harness a black dragon's mastery of toxic acid. For the duration, the target is resistant to acid damage and can use an action on its turns to launch a dark green ball of acid up to 30 feet in a straight line. The acid ball hits the first creature in its path, which must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 4d4 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, if the creature fails its saving throw, each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 acid damage. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both damage instances increase by 1d4 for every two slot levels above 3rd.
