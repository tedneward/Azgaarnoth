As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the
spell fails. You gain a bonus on this attack roll equal
to the number of your allies you can see within 10
feet of the target (maximum 5). If the attack hits, it
deals an extra 3d6 psychic damage to the target, and
the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, until the end of its next turn it cannot
take reactions, and it has disadvantage on attack
rolls against you and your allies.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the extra psychic
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
3rd.
