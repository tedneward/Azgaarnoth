#### Storm Cone
*3rd-level evocation* (Cleric,Druid,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** self (60 feet)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
When casting this spell, you point in a direction and
emit a 60-foot cone shaped whirling vortex. As an
action on each of your turns, you can change the
direction of the cone up, down, or sideways by 10
feet.
The vortex whirls around any creature caught in
its area, blasting it with fist-sized balls of force, and
jolting it with small lightning strikes. The creature
takes 5d4 bludgeoning damage from the wind
buffets, and 2d4 lightning damage. A successful
Dexterity saving throw halves the bludgeoning
damage, but not the lightning damage.
In addition, a spellcaster caught in the cone must
make a successful Constitution saving throw when
casting a spell with somatic components. Though it
is against your normal spellcasting DC, this saving
throw is the equivalent of a roll to maintain
concentration on a spell, and special benefits or
other effects the creatures has on such Constitution
saving throws apply.
