#### Shout of Deafening Thunder
*4th-level evocation* (Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You let out a thunderous shout that blasts outward
from you in a 30-foot cone. A creature caught in the
blast must succeed on a Constitution saving throw
or take 4d6 thunder damage and be deafened until
the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the
creature takes half the damage and isn't deafened.
A creature made of inorganic material such as
stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this
saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn't being
worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the
spell's area. The sound of the shout can be heard up
to 500 feet away (or farther with a successful
Wisdom (Perception) check as determined by your
DM).
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the thunder
damage increases by 1d6 for every slot level above
4th.
