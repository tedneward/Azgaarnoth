*2nd-level abjuration* (Bard,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A ray of multi-coloured light streaks out from your
hand at a creature within range, unleashing a
dizzying array of swirling flashes. Make a ranged
spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target
takes 3d4 psychic damage and until the end of its
next turn it cannot take reactions and has
disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight or Perception),
and Intelligence (Investigation) checks. If the target
is concentrating on a spell, instead of making the
normal saving throw to maintain concentration
when taking damage, it must make a Constitution
saving throw with disadvantage against your spell
save DC. On a failure, the target loses concentration
on the spell.
