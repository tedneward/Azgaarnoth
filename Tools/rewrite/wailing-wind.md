When this spell is cast, you set up a magical
warning system. Choose any kind of area within
range that is an exit or entrance to an indoor or
underground area of any kind. The total size of the
entrance or exit chosen must fit with a 40-foot cube.
Until the spell ends, a wailing, whistling wind blows
towards you whenever a Tiny or larger creature
touches or enters the warded area.
You do not have to be in the area to receive the
knowledge this spell provides. The wailing wind will
seek you out as long as you are within 500 feet of
the target area. The wailing wind has a distinct
audible sound that can be heard by any creature,
though they do not know what it means unless they
are familiar with this spell.
