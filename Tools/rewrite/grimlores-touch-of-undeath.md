---
You touch a creature, causing it to make a Constitution saving throw. For the duration, the target becomes incapacitated on a failed save. The target can make a Constitution save at the end of its turns, removing the incapacitated effect on a success. While incapacitated in this manner, the target begins to give off a toxic odor. Any creature that is within 5 feet of the target at the start of its turn must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. A remove curse spell ends this spell on an incapacitated creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, an additional creature may become incapacited by this spell. When the primary target succeeds on their Constitution saving throw and ends the incapacitated effect on itself, another creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution save or become incapacitated for the remaining duration. Only 1 creature can be incapacited by this spell at a time.

If you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, this effect can spread to 1 additional creature. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, this effect can spread to 2 additional creatures. If you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, this effect can spread to 3 additional creatures. If you use a spell slot of 9th level or higher, this effect can spread to 4 additional creatures.
