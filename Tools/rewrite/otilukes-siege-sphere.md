You create a boulder-sized orb of force that you can
load into a catapult or trebuchet. Before the orb is
fired, it is made of pure force and can only be
destroyed by disintegrate or dispel magic. Once the
orb has been fired you can choose one of the
following effects:
* Crystal Shards.  At any point within the range
of the catapult or trebuchet the orb explodes
into crystal shards. Everyone within 20 feet of
the exploding orb must make a Dexterity saving
throw. Targets take 6d8 force damage on a
failed save, and half as much on a successful
one.
* Liquid Fire. The orb strikes any point within
the range of the catapult or trebuchet and
shatters, spraying liquid fire that sticks to
anything. Everyone within 30 feet of the
shattered orb must make a Dexterity saving
throw. Targets take 4d6 fire damage in a failed
save and half as much on a successful one. The
target continues to burn. At the beginning of
their turn the target must make a Dexterity
saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed
save and half as much on a successful one. Once
the target makes three Dexterity saving throws,
the fire goes out. The fire lasts for 10 minutes
and creatures that start their turn into the area
or moves into the area takes 2d6 fire damage on
a failed Dexterity save.
* Wrecking Ball. The orb strikes any target
within the range of the catapult or trebuchet. A
split second before impact the orb becomes
impossibly dense. Choose one target within
range, which must make a Dexterity saving
throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a
failed save and no damage on a successful one.
This effect deals double damage against objects.
