You create a number of false magical auras that blink in and out of the perceptions of any creature that can sense magic, moving from object to object as they do so. Choose a point within range. Within a 30-foot radius centered on that point, any saving throw made against a divination spell is made with advantage, and the true magical (or nonmagical) natures of creatures or objects cannot be detected. The [detect magic]() and [identify]() spells, and other effects that detect or discern magical properties, do not yield any useful information. Spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladinâ€™s Divine Sense feature or the trigger of a symbol spell, are also ineffective within the area. Each creature or object in the area appears magical one moment, or nonmagical the next, and whenever a target does have a magical aura, it appears to belong to a different school of magic each time it is perceived.

The changing magical auras are only visible to those who can *detect magic* or employ one of the other effects described above.
