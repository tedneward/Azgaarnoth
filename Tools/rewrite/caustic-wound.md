You infuse your blood with caustic acid. Until the start of your next turn, when you take piercing or slashing damage, a spray of acidic blood bursts from the wound, including from the triggering response. One creature in a 10-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The acid destroys any susceptible objects in the area that are not worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
