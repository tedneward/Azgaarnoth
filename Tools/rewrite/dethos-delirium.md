*3rd-level enchantment* (Warlock)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small silver or brass bell)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You touch a creature that is either drugged,
drunken, unconscious, or sleeping, and it must
make a Wisdom saving throw. The saving throw is
made with disadvantage if the creature is asleep or
unconscious. On a failed save, the creature begins
to talk randomly. At the start of the creature's turn
each round, roll 1d4; on a roll of 1, the creature speaks a password, a word to activate an item, the
name of a secret location, the direction toward a
hideout, or other similar secret information.
The creature can't be asked specific questions. At
the end of each of the creature's turns, it can
attempt a new Wisdom saving throw. On a
successful save, the creature is no longer affected by
this spell. If the creature is awakened or cured of its
current condition at any time, the spell ends.
