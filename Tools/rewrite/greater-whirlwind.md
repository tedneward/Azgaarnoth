*9th-level evocation* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute This is a more potent version of whirlwind . The
---
whirlwind touches the ground at a point you choose
within range. Its area is a 20-foot radius by 60-foot
high cylinder centered on that point. Until the spell
ends, you can use an action on each of your turns to
move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction
along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any large
or smaller objects in its area that aren't secured,
worn, or carried by any creature.
A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw
the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind's
area, or when the whirlwind enters its space,
including when the whirlwind first appears. A
creature takes 15d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed
saving throw, or half that on a successful one. In
addition, a Huge or smaller creature that fails its
save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or
become restrained within the whirlwind. A
restrained creature is pulled 5 feet higher at the
start of each of its turns while inside the whirlwind
unless it is already at the top. The creature moves
with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends,
unless it has some means to stay aloft.
A creature restrained by the whirlwind can use an
action to make a Strength or Dexterity check
against the spellcaster's save DC. On a success, the
creature is no longer restrained, and it is hurled 3d6
x 10 feet in a random direction. A thrown creature
takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet thrown if
it strikes a solid object.
