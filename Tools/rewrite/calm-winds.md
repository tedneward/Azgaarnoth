#### Calm Winds
*4th-level evocation* (Cleric,Druid,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
When you cast this spell, it stills the air around you,
creating an area of calm within a 20-foot radius
sphere centered on you. A creature inside the spell's
area is immune to the effects of high winds from
either natural effects or spells. In addition, air-based
elemental creatures treat the area as difficult terrain
for the duration, and feel an instinctive urge to
avoid entering it.
The spell's protective area moves with the caster,
who can only move at half speed while
concentrating on the spell.
