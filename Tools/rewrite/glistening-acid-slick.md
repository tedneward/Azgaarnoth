You conjure a spray of translucent acid that covers the ground in a 60-foot cone. Until the spell ends, ground in the area is covered by slippery patches of foaming acid, making it difficult terrain. When it appears, each creature standing in the area takes 2d4 acid damage and must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there takes 2d4 acid damage and must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

In addition, whenever a creature falls prone within the area or ends its turn while prone within the area, it takes 6d4 acid damage. This spell treats creatures that are permanently immune to being prone as if they are always prone instead This spell only affects creatures that are on the ground.
