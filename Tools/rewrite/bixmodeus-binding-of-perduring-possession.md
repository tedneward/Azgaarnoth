You embed the soul and personality of a willing target into an item. While affected by this spell, the target doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age or die. It retains its senses. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the target. 

The target's perception of the vessel may vary and is chosen by the caster as they form a mental image of the target's place of voluntary imprisonment. The target will be able to verbally communicate with creatures outside of the vessel, and to communicate telepathically with creatures attuned to the item. While within the vessel, the target may summon any mundane items they desire.

The item used as a vessel gains a magical aura about it and is inured to wear and damage. It also has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and resistant to damage originating from such. The item uses the statistics of the bound creature for saving throws, and the maximum value of the bound creature's Hit Dice (including its Constitution modifier) for determining the item's HP. Its AC is 25, and any damage to it is repaired at a rate of 5 HP per round.

***Ending the Spell.*** The spell may be ended through a ceremonial ritual where diamonds worth at least 500gp per Hit Die of the bound target are fired in a brazier for 24 hours, stoked and fueled with rare herbs native to the target's place of birth. The item must be laid upon the diamonds for the duration of the ceremony, and the true name of the target chanted at its zenith. Performing this ritual will expunge the target's soul from the item, releasing it to its expected destination upon death, and destroying the possessed item along with all resources used in the ritual. 

A [dispel magic](/Magic/Spells/dispel-magic.md) spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting the item.
