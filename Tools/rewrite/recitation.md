By reciting a sacred passage or declaration from
holy teachings, you invoke ancient divine blessings
upon your allies. Choose up to four creatures within
range, one of which may be yourself. Whenever a
target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before
the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the
number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.
If the target worships the same patron deity as
you, it may choose to roll a d6 for the benefit of this
spell instead of a d4.
Whether or not you choose yourself as a target of
this spell, you gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class
for the duration.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
