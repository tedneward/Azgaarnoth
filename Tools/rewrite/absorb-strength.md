___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction (when a creature within range is slain)

- **Duration:** 1 round
---
As a creature's spirit exits its body, you reach out
and use its essence to make yourself more powerful.
You gain 20 temporary hit points and the next spell
you cast is cast as if it were one spell level higher. If
the spell does not benefit from being cast with a
higher spell level, then you only receive the
temporary hit points. You must cast this spell
during your next turn. The temporary hit points last
until you finish your next long rest.
