Choose one creature within range, which must
make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature
succeeds, the spell fails. On a failure, any time the
creature attempts to cast a spell for the duration, it
instead casts a randomly determined spell of the
same level. The arcane spellcaster can repeat the
Wisdom saving throw at the end of their turn to
end the spell.
