#### Fire Hawk
*Evocation cantrip (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You conjure a minor spirit in the form of a flaming
hawk, which makes a swooping attack against your
foe and then circles above it for a moment to strike
again if your foe's defenses falter.
Make a ranged spell attack against a creature
within range. If the attack hits, the target takes 1d8
fire damage and has the fiery hawk remains looming
above it. If the target provokes an opportunity
attack before the start of your next turn (whether
such an attack is actually made or not), it
immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage and the spell
ends.
The fire damage from this ranged spell attack
increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th
level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
