You don the mask, linking it to a random faerie
spirit. Anyone attempting to target you or include
within the area of effect of a divination spell must
make an Intelligence saving throw. If they fail the
divination spell show images of the faerie spirit.
Faerie spirit will know its being observed and most
are intelligent enough to figure out why. Most
faeries will be curious, and a few will be openly
hostile toward you and the caster of the divination
spell. If the mask is destroyed before the spell
duration expires, the spell ends.
