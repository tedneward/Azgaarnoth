When you cast this spell, you touch a creature and grant it an affinity for earth and stone. For the duration of the spell, the creature has resistance to damage from creatures or objects made of any kind of earth (including stone, dust, soil, clay, or elemental earth), and from earth-based spells and magical effects. This includes falling rocks, falling damage from impacting against any kind of earth, attacks by earth-based creatures (such as clay or stone golems, gargoyles, earth elementals). Acid damage and damage from metal objects or creatures are not considered earth-based for purposes of this spell, which grants no resistance to such damage.
