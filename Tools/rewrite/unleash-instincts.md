Until this spell ends, you unlock the primal nature
of your body and mind, and you gain the following
benefits:
* You can substitute your spellcasting ability
score for your Strength score for purposes of
unarmed strikes (including both attack and
damage rolls), ability checks, and determining
your jump distance or carrying capacity
(including maximum load and maximum lift).
* You add your spellcasting ability modifier to
Dexterity checks and Wisdom checks.
* When you make an unarmed strike, the damage
you inflict is psychic damage, and you can roll a
d8 in place of the normal damage.
* Your speed increases by 10 feet.
* You can use your bonus action to make an
unarmed strike or take the Dash action.
* You gain darkvision up to a distance of 30 feet.
* You can track other creatures while traveling at
a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while
traveling at a normal pace.
If you end your turn wearing heavy armor, you
must roll a Constitution saving throw against a DC
equal to your own spellcasting DC. If you fail, you
lose concentration and the spell ends.
If you roll initiative before this spell ends, if the
remaining amount of time you can maintain your
concentration on this spell is greater than 1 minute,
that duration is reduced, and you can only maintain
your concentration on the spell for up to 1 minute
after making the initiative roll.
In addition, when you make a Strength, Dexterity,
or Constitution saving throw, if the number rolled
on the die is 16 or lower, you can use your reaction
to treat the number rolled on the d20 as a 17. If you
do so, you gain advantage on all Strength, Dexterity,
or Constitution saving throws until the beginning of
your next turn, at which time the spell ends.
