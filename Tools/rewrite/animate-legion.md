#### Animate Legion
*5th-level necromancy* (Cleric,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (the tongues of 5 dead men)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You send gathered necrotic energy cascading into
the ground around you, and seconds later corpses
within the area start to twitch and drag themselves
to their feet. You choose a number of corpses within
range equal to your spellcasting ability modifier and
animate them, as if with the animate dead  spell.
Treat these animated corpses as zombies , with
the following exceptions. The zombies follow your
commands to the best of their ability but are not
intelligent and take things very literally. Each zombie's initiative is the same as yours, but its turn
does not take place until yours ends. If you do not
issue a new command to the zombie, it will
continue to follow any previous orders if possible,
otherwise it takes the dodge action. Undead
animated by this spell cannot be turned. When
reduced to 0 hit points or after the spell ends, each
zombie turns back into a lifeless corpse.
