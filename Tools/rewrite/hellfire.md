___

- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of coal)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
A fiery coal ignites in the palm of your hand. A creature that you can see within range must make a Dexterity saving throw, as the coal flies towards the target. On a failed save, the target takes 6d8 fire damage initially and then 2d8 fire damage at the start of each of their turns for the duration. The target takes half as much initial damage and no subsequent damage on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, all damage instances increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
