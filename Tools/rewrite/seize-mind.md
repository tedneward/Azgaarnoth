With a whispered word and a piercing
gaze, you momentarily project an
impulse into your enemy's mind, channeling its hostility towards you into a
sudden reflexive attack against another of your foes.
Choose one humanoid creature you can see within
range that can also see and hear you. The target
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
charmed by you until the start of its next turn. A
creature has advantage on this saving throw if it is
not currently in combat, or if it has witnessed
another creature fail its saving throw against your
casting of this spell within the past minute.
When you charm a target with this spell, any
other creatures who can see or hear you know you
have magically influenced the target, and you can
immediately choose one of two effects:
* You can force the charmed target to walk up to
15 feet, and you choose its movement. It will not
move into difficult terrain or through the spaces
of other creatures, and its movement only
provokes opportunity attacks from other
creatures hostile to you. After the creature
moves, the spell ends.
* You can make a melee spell attack against
another creature within 5 feet of the charmed
target. The charmed target delivers this melee
spell attack, as if it had cast the spell. On a hit,
the attack inflicts 1d6 psychic damage. Whether
the attack hits or misses, the spell ends.
When the spell ends, the creature realizes that
you used magic to control it and becomes hostile
toward you. It likely seeks to attack you or your
allies, but will not do so if doing so would be
disadvantageous for it or its friends. The creature
might also seek retribution in other ways (at the
DM's discretion), depending on the situation.
The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you
reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level
(4d6).
