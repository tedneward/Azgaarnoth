You change the features of any dead humanoid to
mimic someone else. You must either know the
person you are mimicking or have an accurate
picture or image of them. This spell can be cast on
an undead creature that has a tangible body and an
intact face (such as a zombie), but its statistics and
behavior do not change. A body that is the target of
this spell retains the facial features for the duration,
even if it is then animated as undead.
