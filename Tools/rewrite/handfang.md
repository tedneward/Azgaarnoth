A drooling mouth appears on the palm of your
hand. The teeth are small and useless for combat,
but the saliva is highly acidic, and the tongue lolls
out of the mouth, grotesquely looking for victims.
Make a melee spell attack. If you hit you inflict 2d6
plus your spellcasting ability modifier acid damage.
If you roll a critical hit, the target takes double
damage and must make a Constitution saving
throw. If they fail your target is paralyzed for 1
minute. It can repeat the Constitution saving throw
at the end of each of its turn to end the paralysis.
