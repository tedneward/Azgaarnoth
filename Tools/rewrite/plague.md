You point at a creature within range, causing a dark green glow to pass over their body. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 poison damage and become diseased; suffering disadvantage on all attack and skill checks for the duration as their skin begins to form pustules all over its body. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If the disease is not removed within 1 hour, the creature must make another Constitution saving throw or die. If a creature dies as the result of this spell, every creature within 10 feet must make a Constitution saving throw or become affected by this spell, as if it was initially cast on them. Constructs and undead are immune to the spell.
