You tap a lock with the key. For the duration, only
that key can open that lock. Any attempt to pick,
damage, or break the lock, magical or otherwise,
will fail. Even a dispel magic will fail if it targets the
lock. Once the spell is cast it will last for the
duration, even if the wizard who cast it wants it to
end. This spell does not confer any immunity or
special qualities to the door or container attached
to the lock.
