You open a rift and are able to reach through to borrow idle time from your future self. Once per round for 1d6+4 rounds, you may take an additional action or bonus action at the end of another creature's turn. Acting in this manner consumes your reaction. At any point for the duration, if you lose your concentration, you become stunned for a number of rounds equal to the initial roll of 1d6.
