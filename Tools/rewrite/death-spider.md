#### Death Spider
*8th-level transmutation* (Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small live spider, a drop of stomach acid, and a tooth)
- **Duration:** Permanent
---
You touch a creature, and it must immediately
make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, one
of its limbs turns into a mindless, hairy spider. On
the target's next turn, the spider twists around and
starts to devour its host. The target then takes 1d6
piercing damage at the start of each of its turns.
Dispel magic  can only halt the spell and save the
limb if it is cast before the end of your next turn
after death spider  is cast. Otherwise, the spider limb
must be hacked off (15 AC, 40 hp, vulnerable to
slashing damage), which kills the spider. If the
spider is not stopped, it will continue to inflict
damage on its host, consuming it when it reaches 0
hp, and then growing into a giant spider  over the
next 24 hours.
