---
You mentally connect with a group of spirits whose lives ended in an unnatural death. The spirits belonging to any creatures within 30 feet of you that died within the last 24 hours simultaneously overwhelm you with the emotions they felt before passing. If there are more than 5 dead creatures in range when casting this spell, make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 2d6 psychic damage and cannot cast this spell again until you finish a long rest.

On a successful save, or if there are 5 or fewer dead creatures within range, you are able to briefly sense the emotions of the creatures during their final moments before death. The DM will describe the most prevalent emotions felt by the dead creatures within range, such as "anger," "terror," "guilt," "grief," or "sadness."
