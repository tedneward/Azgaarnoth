A wave of noxious energy flows out from your hands over the land, infecting everything in its path. Each creature you choose within a 30-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes 4d10 poison damage and becomes poisoned for 1 minute on a failed save, or half as much damage and is not poisoned on a successful one. Undead and Constructs automatically succeed on the save.
