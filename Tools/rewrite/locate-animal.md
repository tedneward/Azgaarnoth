___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur, a scale, a feather, or another physical remnant from the type of beast you seek)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 4 hours
---
You focus on a specific type of beast. If it is within
15 miles of you, you learn the direction and
distance, and if it is within 15 moving you know the
direction of its movement. This spell doesn't locate
a beast if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a
direct path between you and the beast.
The spell can locate a specific beast known to
you, or the nearest beast of the same kind (bear,
tiger, or wolf), so long as you have seen such a beast
you described or named is in a different form, such
as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this
spell doesn't locate the beast.
