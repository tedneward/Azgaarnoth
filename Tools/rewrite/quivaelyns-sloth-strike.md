- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
---
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the
spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's
normal effects and takes an additional 1d10 cold
damage, as its blood turns to leaden ice and its
limbs grow heavy. Until the end of your next turn,
the target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to
AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use
reactions. On the target's next turn, it can use either
an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of
the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make
more than one melee or ranged attack during its
turn.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial extra
damage dealt by the attack increases by 1d10 for
each slot level above 2nd.
