- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of coal and a dried eyeball from any creature)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You invoke a stationary 20-foot radius sphere of
magical darkness that emanates from a point you
can see within range. This darkness blocks
darkvision and all nonmagical light sources, but you
can see normally through the area. You can cast the
darkness on an object and carry it with you. The
darkness radiates from such an object, and you can
block the darkness by covering the object, as if
hiding the light of a lantern. If the area of the
darkness intersects with an area of magical light
created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that
created the light is instantly dispelled.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius of the
sphere increases by five feet for every slot level
above 3rd.
