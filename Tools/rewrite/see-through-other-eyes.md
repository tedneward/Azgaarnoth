___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S M (a beholder eyestalk)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
Choose one target within range. That target must
make a Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, you can
see through their eyes. The target is unaware that
you can see through their eyes. You may use a
bonus action to switch between your target's eyes
and your own. You do not gain access to any of the
other senses your target possesses, but you can see
through their eyes for the duration of the spell as
long as your target stays on the same plane and
does not enter an anti-magic field. If the target
successfully saves, the spell has no effect.
