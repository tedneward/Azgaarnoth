When you cast this spell, three motes of lightning
appear next to you, and you can direct each mote to
strike a target within the spell's range. You can
direct the motes to strike a single target or separate
targets. Make a separate ranged spell attack for each
mote. On a hit, the mote deals 4d6 lightning
damage, and then fades away.
You do not have to fire all the motes on the round
you cast the spell. On each successive turn, you can
use an action to fire any remaining motes. If a turn
passes without firing any motes, the spell ends, and
all remaining motes vanish.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the amount of
lightning damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 5th.
