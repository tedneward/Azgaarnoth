You turn a pile of sand into a scimitar that burns
with the heat of the desert sun. The scimitar inflicts
1d6 slashing damage plus 1d6 fire damage on a
successful hit. You may use your spellcasting ability
modifier for to hit and damage rolls with the
scimitar. If you roll a 1 to hit, the scimitar shatters
into a thousand pieces and you must forge a new
one.
If you roll a natural 20 to hit, you may choose to
shatter the scimitar. The scimitar is destroyed but
the shards are buried into your target. Your target
must make a Constitution saving throw. If they
succeed, they rip the shards from their body. If they
fail, they take 1d6 slashing damage at the beginning
of your turn. The victim can repeat the Constitution
saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the
damage on a successful save. The shards will
continue to burrow into your victim until it dies or
successfully saves.
