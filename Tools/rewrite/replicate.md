#### Replicate
*9th-level conjuration* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 12 hours
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (Some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of your body; and a ruby worth 2,500 gp, which is consumed by the spell)
- **Duration:** Permanent
---
You create a duplicate of yourself that is similar to you in every way at the time of casting. You can communicate with your duplicate telepathically, and it obeys all of your commands. Your duplicate has all of the same abilities (though none of your equipment), spells and features that you do, but these become shared resources between you both. If your duplicate casts a spell, you both lose the corresponding spell slot, for example. Your duplicate ages at the same rate as you do and is immune to the [dispel magic](/Magic/Spells/dispel-magic.md) spell. You may only have one duplicate active at a time, and your duplicate is not able to cast this spell.

The duplicate dies when it drops to 0 hit points, ending the spell. If you die while your duplicate is still alive, your soul is transferred to it, and it becomes your new form, ending the spell.
