#### Rusting Grasp
*3rd-level transmutation* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of rust monster chitin)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You reach out and touch a single nonmagical ferrous metal (iron, steel, or alloy) object, causing it to instantly corrode into flakes of rust. This spell only affects a 5-foot-cube area, leaving any portion of the object outside that area unaffected. A creature wearing or carrying the object can make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid this effect.
