You raise your weapon defiantly and shout a
magical imprecation at a foe that dares to assault
your comrade.
Make a weapon attack against the attacker. If you
attack with a melee weapon, your reach for this
attack is increased to 30 feet. If the attack hits, it
deals an extra 3d8 radiant damage to the target.
Whether you hit or miss, the target must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is
blinded until the end of its next turn.
