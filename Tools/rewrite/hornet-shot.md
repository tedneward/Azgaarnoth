*5th-level transmutation* (Artificer,Druid,Ranger,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S, M (a ranged weapon)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Your weapon buzzes with toxic energy as you infuse
it with magic, and when it strikes your target it
emits a cloud of hornet-like motes that sting your
foe and nearby enemies. As part of the action used
to cast this spell, you must make a ranged weapon
attack, otherwise the spell fails. If that attack hits,
the target takes an additional 3d10 piercing damage,
and attack rolls against it from more than 10 feet
away are made with advantage. At the end of each
of the target's turns before the spell ends, it must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d10
poison damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.
For the duration of the spell, a creature that
moves within 5 feet of the target for the first time
during its turn or starts its turn there is attacked by
the motes and must make a Constitution saving
throw. The creature takes 2d6 poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the piercing
damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above
5th.
