___

- **Range:** Self

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
While casting this spell you name one creature you
know firsthand. You begin to slowly spin, as the
spell takes hold you spin faster and faster, becoming
a blur. When the spell ends you stop, with your
extended arm pointed directly toward that creature.
You also get a sense of the target's physical and
emotional wellbeing (whether it isinjured, sleepy,
hungry, etc.). If the target is on a different plane,
the spell fails.
If the target is unwilling to be located, it can
make a Wisdom saving throw. On success, the spell
fails.
