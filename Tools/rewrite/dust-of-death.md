#### Dust of Death
*6th-level transmutation* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You turn a small pinch of dust into a deadly poison.
If this poison is ingested (such as if you slip it into
their food or drink), the victim must make a
Constitution saving throw. The victim takes 10d8
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. If this reduces its hit
points to 0, it dies.
This poison cannot be detected by non-magical
means. Victims of this spell are left with a residue of
dust around their mouths.
