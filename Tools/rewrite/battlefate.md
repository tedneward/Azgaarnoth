---
Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of
you as the spell's target. At the start of each of its
turns until the spell ends, the target gains a d6
battlefate die.  During that turn, when the target
makes an an attack roll, ability check, saving throw,
or damage roll, it can choose to roll the battlefate
die and add the result to the total for that roll. If the target ends its turn with an unused
battlefate die, it must roll the die immediately,
gaining a bonus to its armor class equal to half the
result. This bonus ends at the start of its next turn.
If a creature would have ever have more than one
battlefate die (such as from multiple castings of this
spell), it chooses only one of the battlefate dice to
keep; the others are lost.
At Higher Levels.  The battlefate die increases
when you cast this spell using a higher-level spell
slot. With a 3rd or 4th level slot, the die increases to
a d8. A 5th or 6th level slot increases the die to a
d10, and a 7th level or higher slots increases it to a
d12.
