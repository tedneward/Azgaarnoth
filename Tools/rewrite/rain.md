You must be outdoors to cast this spell. The spell ends if you move to an area without line of sight to the sky. When you cast the spell, you conjure rain clouds in the sky directly above you within a 100-foot radius, centered on you for the duration. You can cause the area to experience rainfall. You can not change any other aspect of the weather. The rainfall is mild, and it can warm or cool the ambient temperature by up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit. It causes all objects to become wet and reduces their combustibility accordingly. The rainfall is sufficient to extinguish small fires (such as a campfire) within 1 round, significant fires (such as a house fire) within 1 minute, and raging infernos (such as a wildfire) within 10 minutes. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to its original conditions over the course of a 10 minute period.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the area of effect doubles for each slot level above 2nd (3rd level; 200-foot radius, 4th level; 400-foot radius, 5th level; 800-foot radius, and so on).
