*4th-level necromancy* (Cleric,Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You imbue an undead target with a sliver of life,
making it vulnerable to conditions that usually
affect the living. When you cast this spell, you make
a melee spell attack against an undead target. On a
hit, the undead creature must make a Wisdom
saving throw or lose all of its condition immunities.
The target also loses its damage resistances, and its
damage immunities become resistances instead.
After the spell expires, the target knows what you
have done, and will likely have a hostile attitude
toward you.
