---
One of your arms becomes a misshapen, bestial
appendage, allowing you to grab your opponents
with an iron grip. Choose an opponent within range
and make a melee spell attack. If you hit, the target
takes takes 2d4 bludgeoning damage and it is
grappled. The DC for any
attempt to escape the
grapple is your
spellcasting DC.
Until the spell ends,
when you do not
have a creature
grappled during your
turn, you can use your
action to make a melee spell
attack against one creature within
range, suffering the same effects if
you hit.
For the spell's duration, you also
suffer disadvantage on Charisma
(Persuasion) checks.
At Higher Levels.  When you
cast this spell using a spell slot
of 2nd level or higher, the bludgeoning
damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above
1st.
