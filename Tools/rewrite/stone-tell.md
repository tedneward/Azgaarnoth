*6th-level divination* (Druid)
___

- **Components:** V, S

---
You grant an area of stone with a maximum size of
20 cubic feet the ability to speak to you for the
duration. You can ask the stone questions, and it
will provide answers to the best of its ability. The
stone can tell you what creatures have recently
passed nearby or have touched it, or what lies
beyond. However, the stone communicates with a
primordial intelligence, so you might not receive
the answers you'd expect.
