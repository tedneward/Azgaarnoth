You touch one willing creature and grant it a prophecy of luck. Until the spell ends, the target can grant itself advantage on any attack roli ability check, or saving throw that it makes, and it can impose disadvantage on any attack roll made against it. It can only do this up to twice per turn, and must do so before the roll is made.
