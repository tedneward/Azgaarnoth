You infuse your eyes and mind with powerful divination magic that enables you to see everything that surrounds you. Until the spell ends, you cannot be surprised, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid traps, and you have truesight, blindsight, and tremorsense that all extend to a range of 150 feet. You have advantage on initiative checks and any ability checks that rely on vision, hearing, or smell You also gain a + 10 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks. 

In addition, you can see through walls, floors, ceilings, and all other opaque, nonliving materials within 150 feet as if they were translucent, including Undead and Constructs. Your line of sight cannot be blocked by any materials that appear translucent to you via this speli and you can hear all things within the area clearly as if there were no obstructions between you and the sound. You can also see into the ethereal plane to a range of 150 feet. Your vision can only be blocked by a barrier of lead that is at least 1 foot thick.

Finally, you can see things within 150 feet that are normally perceived by other senses. You can see the temperature of objects, with cold things emanating a faint blue aura, and hot things emanating a faint red aura. You can see the flows and currents of scents and smells in the air, and you can automatically determine what those scents are by the colors you see with as much clarity as if you had smelled them directly. You can see a faint aura around any creature or object that bears magic, and you can see the invisible flow of mana and magical energy in the air. You can even see the sounds of music as colors and shapes - though purely for your own entertainment.
