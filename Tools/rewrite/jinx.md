---
You incant and point at one creature you can see within range, cursing it with a premonition of horrible luck. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target is cursed until the spell ends. While affected by this curse, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

A creature cursed by this spell repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.
