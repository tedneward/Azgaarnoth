You link your life force to an oak tree. The oak tree
must be at least 150 years old and cannot be the
home of another soul (including a dryad). A magical, invisible tether connects you to the tree,
and as long as you maintain the connection you
cannot die. If you die your spirit is drawn into the
tree. Over the course of the next week a new body is
created inside the tree. Once the body is finished it
is placed within the closest empty space near the
oak tree, and the spell ends.
If someone attempts to bring you back to life the
body you abandoned suddenly decomposes,
violently. If you or the oak tree leave are no longer
on the same plane, the spell ends. If you enter a
dead magic zone, the spell ends. If the oak tree dies,
you immediately die and cannot be resurrected by
any means short of a wish or divine intervention.
You may use an action to get a general sense of the
oak tree's condition. You do not have any sense of
what is happening around the oak tree, just the
general sense of the tree's condition.
