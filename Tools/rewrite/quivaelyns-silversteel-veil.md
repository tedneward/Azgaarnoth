A magical ward of thin, wispy silver mist, seemingly
no more tangible than warm breath on a frosty
morning, gathers under enemy blows and turns
them aside. Until the end of your next turn, you and
any allies within 5 feet of you have half cover
against all enemies, and all Wisdom (Perception)
checks made to see you or those allies are rolled
with disadvantage.
