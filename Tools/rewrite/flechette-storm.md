- **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a metal shard)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A deadly shower of razor-sharp metal blades bursts forth from your outstretched hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 piercing damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

These blades are considered magical weapons for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
