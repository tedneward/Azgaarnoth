Choose a point within range. Every creature within 10 feet of that point must make a Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail are filled with the overwhelming desire to murder you. They will move toward you as soon as they can, though they will
not move into an obviously dangerous area. If the creature cannot get to you, the spell ends for that creature.
Creatures effected by this spell will use the Dash action to get close to you, and once within melee range with target you with all of their attacks. The creatures will perform no other actions. The creatures targeted by this spell have advantage on all melee attacks against you.
