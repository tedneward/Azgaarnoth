You coat a willing creature in a sheen of potent acid.

A creature that touches or hits the target creature with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it, takes 1d8 acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the target creature corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed.

Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the target creature is destroyed after dealing damage.

The target creature can dissolve through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round.

The target creatureâ€™s unarmed attacks infl ict 1d8 acid damage. In addition, nonmagical armor worn by the target is partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers from each successful strike. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 3rd.
