#### Psychic Shock
*Illusion cantrip (Sorcerer)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You invade another creature's mind, and for one
split second, you cause them to perceive some
image, noise, or memory that would cause them
stress. Choose a target you can see or hear within
range. The creature makes an Intelligence saving
throw. If it fails, the creature takes 1d6 psychic
damage, and it has disadvantage on the next
Wisdom check it makes before the end of your next
turn. If the creature has not yet acted this combat, it
suffers an additional effect: it makes its next attack
roll at disadvantage.
You do not know what image the creature saw
unless you can read its thoughts by other means
(such as the detect thoughts  spell). If the creature
fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it does not
realize a cantrip caused this effect and believes the
flash of emotional pain it experienced came from its
own mind.
This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you
reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level
(4d6).
