---
You heal your wounds by draining vital energies
from a foe you touch. Make a melee spell attack
against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the
target takes 1d8 necrotic damage and it is paralyzed
until the end of your next turn, and you or an ally
within 5 feet regain hit points equal to half the
amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell
ends, you can make the attack again on each of your
turns as an action, but only against the same target.
