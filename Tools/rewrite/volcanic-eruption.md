---
You draw molten lava up through the ground,
which erupts to fill a sphere with a radius of 360
feet. The entire radius (even the sky above it and
the underground beneath it) immediately becomes
difficult terrain for the duration, and each creature
within that radius must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6
bludgeoning damage and 2d6 fire damage, and its
walking speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its
next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as
much damage and suffers no other effects. A
creature with full cover is still affected, but
automatically succeeds on its saving throw. You
take no damage from this spell, and automatically
succeed on saving throws against it.
Until the spell ends, if you can see some part of the area of the spell, you can use a bonus action on
each of your turns to force each creature in the area
to make another saving throw or suffer the above
effects. You cannot cast this spell if you are more
than 360 feet away from an area of solid ground at
least 10 feet wide, but once it is cast, it lasts for the
duration, even if you are out of range.
When a creature wearing metal armor fails its
saving throw against this effect, it takes 2d6
additional fire damage, and has disadvantage on
attack rolls and ability checks until the start of its
next turn (as if affected by the heat metal  spell).
Firenewts, earth-based elemental creatures (such
as gargoyles), or fire-based elemental creatures
(such as salamanders), do not take damage from
this spell. Instead, such a creature is healed,
regaining hit points equal to half the fire damage
inflicted. Only firenewts or creatures of the
elemental type can benefit from this effect.
The volcanic eruption damages objects in the area
and ignites flammable objects that aren't being
worn or carried. Structures in contact with the
ground in the area that take fire damage from this
effect take extra bludgeoning damage equal to half
the fire damage. If a structure drops to 0 hit points,
it collapses and potentially damages nearby
creatures, as described in the earthquake  spell. The
eruption can be heard up to 500 miles away.
This spell leaves its entire area a blackened ruin
incapable of supporting plant life for a full year.
After that time, however, the ground is more fertile
than it was before the spell was cast.
