You touch the object used as a material component and transmute your body and mind into it. You vanish inside the object and gain control of it, directing it and sensing with it as if it was your body until the spell ends. If it has articulating joints and limbs, such as a suit of armor or a mannequin, you can use those limbs as normal.

While you are inside the object, it is treated as if it were a construct creature. It uses your Dexterity score and mental ability scores as its own, its AC is equal to 12 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and it is immune to poison damage. You can still speak and cast spells, but unless the object has usable limbs, you can't use any material components except for the object itself and you can't use somatic components. You also add your spellcasting ability modifier to any saving throw you make to maintain concentration on the spell.

For the duration, the object gains a flying speed of 40 feet and it can hover, but it can't fly more than 5 feet above the ground You and the object have a set of bonus hit points equal to 5d10 + 25, which you share and use instead of normal hit points. The bonus hit points can't be restored if they are reduced, and the spell ends immediately if they are reduced to 0.

You can use an action while you're inside the object to slam it into a creature within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 3d10 + your spellcasting
ability modifier.

When the spell ends for any reason, you emerge from the object into the nearest unoccupied space of your choice. If the spell ended because you and the object were reduced to O bonus hit points and the object is nonmagicaL it is also destroyed

The spell has different effects for different objects:

* **Armor.** If the object is armor, its AC can't be lower than the base AC provided by the armor to its wearer. If the object is a shield, the spell treats its base AC as 17.
* **Weapon.** If the object is a melee weapon, the spell attack also deals bonus damage on a hit equal 1d10 plus the damage dealt by the weapon. In addition, the damage type is the type that is dealt by the weapon, the attack is also a melee weapon attack using the weapon, and the attack's reach is the reach of the weapon.
* **Heavy Object.** If the object's weight exceeds your carrying capacity, its flying speed is reduced to 20 feet, but it has 25 additional bonus hit points and the spell also deals 1d10 additional damage on a hit.
