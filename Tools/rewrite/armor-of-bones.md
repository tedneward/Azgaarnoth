You encase the armor of a willing creature that you can see within range in solid bone. While not impervious to degradation, this bone armor will grant the target a +3 bonus to AC for the duration.

Additionally, every time a creature within 5 feet lands a successful attack against the target, the attacker takes 3d6 piercing damage as bone shrapnel chips off and strikes the assailant.
