One of your hands sprouts thick bone spikes. It is
useless to hold items or make fine gestures, but it
excels as a weapon. When you swipe the claw
through the air, wounds open on your victim. Make
a ranged spell attack against an opponent in range.
If you hit they take 2d6 plus your spellcasting ability
modifier slashing damage. If you roll a critical hit
then, in addition to the extra damage, at the start of
your next turn the wounds bleeds for an extra 1d4
slashing damage, and the wound will not heal until
it is healed by magic.
