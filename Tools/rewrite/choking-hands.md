- **Components:** V, S, M (a handkerchief with a knot tied in its center)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure a pair of spectral hands that begin to
choke a humanoid you can see within range. The
hands remain attached to the victim for the
duration. At the beginning of each of the target's
turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, the target takes 1d10 bludgeoning
damage, and has disadvantage on attack rolls until
the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the
target is unaffected that round, but the hands
remain attached.
For the duration, as a bonus action on each of
your turns, you can force the target to make a new
Constitution saving throw or suffer the bludgeoning
damage and disadvantage on attack rolls until the
end of its next turn. The spell ends if the creature
dies or loses consciousness.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
