As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the
spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's
normal effects, and you can teleport to an
unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet of
you. If you teleport to a space within 5 feet of the
target, the target cannot take reactions until the
end of your next turn.
The damage of attacks you make with this spell
increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level,
the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage
to the target. This extra radiant damage increases to
2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th level.
