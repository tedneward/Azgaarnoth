An icy shard shoots from your outstretched hand. Make a ranged spell attack against a single creature, dealing 1d6 cold damage on a successful attack. If your attack roll deals critical damage, the target becomes vulnerable to cold damage until the start of your next turn. Creatures resistant or immune to cold damage do not become vulnerable.

This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
