You howl with raw, soul-searing hate. Every
creature within range that is not undead or a
construct within you must make a successful
Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.
Any creature whose hit points are already at 0 must
make an immediate death saving throw. If the
saving throw is successful, it counts as one success.
However, if the saving throw fails, the creature dies.
