---
You create a clone of you made from jade, thatâ€™s identical to you in all respects. It has your ability scores, resistance to all damage, and Hit Points equal to your wizard level. It possesses none of your racial or class features - including spellcasting. Although it appears to possess the same equipment as you, these are part of its form. It can make unarmed attacks, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

You can use your action to issue the clone instructions which it will follow to the best of its abilities. If you do not give it any commands, it takes the Dodge action. If you lose concentration of the spell, or if the clone is reduced to zero hit points, it  immediately turns to dust, which quickly dissipates.
