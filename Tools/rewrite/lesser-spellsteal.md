#### Lesser Spellsteal
*4th-level abjuration* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Up to 1 minute
---
You cause a creature you can see within range to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you place a minor hex on them. The next spell they attempt to cast of 3rd level or lower fails and has no effect. When they fail to cast a spell in this manner, you are able to immediately cast it using your reaction instead. Casting a spell in this manner grants you temporary insight into how the spell is cast even if it is not on your available spell list and does not use a spell slot. The spell is not added to your spellbook.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell level that you can affect increases by one level for each spell level above 4th.
