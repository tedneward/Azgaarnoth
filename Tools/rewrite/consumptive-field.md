- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You sweep your hands through the air, devouring
the fleeting life force of those on the edge of death.
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you can
choose one creature within range that has half its
hit point maximum or less and force it to make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature takes 2d10 necrotic damage, and you have
advantage on Strength ability checks and saving
throws until the end of your next turn. In addition,
you gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic
damage inflicted.
On a successful save, the creature takes half
damage, and you don't gain advantage on Strength
ability checks or saving throws, nor do you gain any
temporary hit points.
Until the spell ends, once during each of your
turns you can use your action to force another
creature with half its hit point maximum or less to
make the Constitution saving throw against the
same effects. For the duration, you also know when
any creature within range has been reduced to half
its hit point maximum or less.
