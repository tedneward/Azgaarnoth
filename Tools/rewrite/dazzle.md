You create a flash of blinding light directly in front of a creature that you can see within range. The target is subjected to a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it has disadvantage on its next attack, or grants advantage on the next attack made against it, whichever comes first. The target must be able to see in order to suffer these effects.
