- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You assume a supernatural combat stance that
channels terror through your weapon in the form of
a howling wind. Until the spell ends, whenever you
hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, it takes
an additional 3d4 psychic damage and must make
a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the next
attack roll made against this target before the end
of your next turn has advantage, and you can push
the target up to 5 feet away from you.
