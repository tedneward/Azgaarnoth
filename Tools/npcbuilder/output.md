>***Channel Divinity (3/Recharges on short or long rest).*** See below for the details of each use.
>
>***Channel Divinity: Touch of Death.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use Channel Divinity to deal 45 extra necrotic damage to the target. This ignores resistance to necrotic damage.
>
>***Divine Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you cause the attack to deal an extra 2d8 necrotic damage to the target.
>
>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Inescapable Destruction.*** Necrotic damage dealt by your cleric spells ignore resistance to necrotic damage.
>
>***Reaper.*** When you cast a necromancy cantrip or 1st through 5th level spell that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, you must provide them for each target.
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>#### Actions
>***Channel Divinity: Turn Undead.***  You can use one of your uses of Channel Divinity to turn undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, if it is a CR of 4 or lower it is destroyed; otherwise it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
>
>***Divine Intervention (Recharges on long rest/seven days).*** Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than {npc.levels('Cleric')}, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
>
>***Cleric Spellcasting (Wis, at level 20. Recharges on long rest).*** 5 cantrips known. 23 spells prepared. Spell save DC: 18, Spell attack bonus: +10

#### Description
Ideals: Beauty, Life, Greater good

Appearance: Flamboyant or outlandish clothing

Talents: Master of disguise

Mannerisms: Fidgets all the time

Interactions with others: Blustering when talking to others

Bond: Loyal to a benefactor, patron, or employer

Flaw: Quick to make assumptions

***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: Winged Elf.*** The *avariel* are generally lighter in stature and size, often up to a full foot shorter than the average high or wood elf, and much lither of form. Their wings can be folded to curl up close to their backs, which if covered with clothing, could allow them to pass for another form of elf, though not under any sort of detailed scrutiny. (Most *avariel* don't like hiding their wings anyway, feeling it to be constricting and claustrophobic.) Generally they wear light clothing, though when flying at high altitudes will wrap themselves in furs or other insulating clothing to help with the chill of the high altitudes.

***Flight.*** To use your wings to fly, you canâ€™t be wearing medium or heavy armor.

***Class: Cleric.*** Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.

***Divine Domain: Death.*** The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. While many of the deities who serve as patrons to Death Clerics are evil and seek the absence of life, others are simply stewards of the realm of the dead. Some are even prone to carefully balance life against death, intervening when too much life threatens an ecosystem and death must be brought to bring things back into careful equilibrium.
