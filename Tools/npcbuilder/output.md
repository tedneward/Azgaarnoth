>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

>***Channel Divinity (2/Recharges on short or long rest).*** See below for the details of each use.
>
>***Divine Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target.
>
>#### Actions
>***Channel Divinity: Torrential Wrath.*** A forceful 10-foot-high wave of cold water erupts in a 30ft-radius circle around you. All creatures within the circle must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 4d6 cold and 4d6 bludgeoning damage and be pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone. Creatures take half as much damage and are not pushed and knocked down on a successful saving throw. Creatures of the Huge size and larger are not pushed back and knocked prone. You must not be in the air when you do this.
>
>***Channel Divinity: Turn Undead.***  You can use one of your uses of Channel Divinity to turn undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, if it is a CR of 1 or lower it is destroyed; otherwise it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

#### Description
***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***High Elf.*** High elves and wood elves are, by this point in Azgaarnoth's history, fairly well intermixed and are found in most locations all across Azgaarnoth; at this point in their evolution, no non-elf can tell the difference between them.

***Class: Cleric.*** Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.

***Divine Domain: Ocean.*** ...
