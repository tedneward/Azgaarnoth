>***Fury of the Small (4/Recharges on long rest).*** When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal 8 extra damage to the creature. You can use this trait no more than once per turn.

>
>***Resonant: Absorption.*** You cast a wizard spell with a spell slot that deals damage to the named target and speak the true name of one creature targeted by the spell. In doing so, you gain 3d6 temporary hit points.
>
>***Resonant: Dissolution.*** You cast a wizard spell with a spell slot that deals damage to the named target and speak the true name of one creature targeted by the spell. The first time the named creature takes damage from the spell, that creature takes an extra 2d8 force damage.

>#### Bonus Actions
>***Extract Name (4/Recharges on long rest).*** A target within 60 feet of you that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 16). On a successful save, you discern that this magic failed, and you can't use this feature on the target again until the next dawn. On a failed save, the target is charmed by you until the end of your next turn, and you mentally learn the charmed target's name or the fact that the target lacks a name.
>
>***Nimble Escape.*** You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

>#### Equipment

>
>Scholar's pack OR Explorer's pack
>
>***Spellbook.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots; the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp per level of spell.Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Copying a spell from your spellbook into another spellbook costs half this amount (in time and gold), since you know it already.

***Race: Goblin.*** Originally a subterranean folk that came to Azgaarnoth as part of the Hordes, goblins can now be found in every corner of Azgaarnoth, often beside their bugbear and hobgoblin kin. Goblins hae thrived in dangerous environments thanks to a special knack for finding the weak spots in foes larger than themselves and for getting out of trouble. Originally the lackeys and servants of their larger goblinoid kin, now many goblins pursue their own destinies, escaping the plots of archfey, gods, and would-be warlords.

***Class: Wizard.*** Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more.

***Arcane Tradition: Onomancy.*** Practitioners of magic well know the power of names, but wizards who follow the tradition of Onomancy use their magic to manipulate the words that encompass existence. Onomancers expand their study into language itself, searching for threads of magical significance that weave through names. Something that is named stands out in the multiverse, distinct from the tapestry of creation all around it.
