>***Arcane Recovery.*** Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can recover up to 10 levels of expended spell slots, none of which can be 6th level or higher.
>
>***Awakened Spellbook.*** While you are holding your Awakened Spellbook, you can use the book as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. When you cast a wizard spell with a spell slot, you can temporarily replace its damage type with the damage type of another spell in your spellbook, as your spellbook magically alters the spell's formula for this casting. When you cast a wizard spell as a ritual, you can use the spell's normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes to it. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
>
>***Durable.*** When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).
>
>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Keen Mind.*** You always know which way is north, the number of hours left before the next sunrise or sunset, and you can accurately recall anything you have seen or heard within the past month.
>
>***Manifest Mind: Remote Cast (7/Recharges on long rest).*** Whenever you cast a wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as if you were in your spellbook's manifested spectral mind's space, instead of your own, using its senses. You can do so a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
>
>***Master Scrivener.*** Whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your Wizardly Quill to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your Awakened Spellbook to be copied onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll. The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest. You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls. The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill.
>
>***Observant.*** If you can see a creature's mouth while it is speaking a language you understand, you can interpret what it's saying by reading its lips. You have a +5 bonus to your passive Intelligence (Investigation) scores.
>
>***Signature Spells.*** You gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
>
>***Spell Mastery.*** By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
>
>***Spellbook.*** Contents: 
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>***War Caster: Concentration.*** You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage.
>
>***War Caster: Somaticism.*** You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.
>
>#### Actions
>***Manifest Mind: Remote View.*** While your spellbook's spectral mind is manifested, you can hear and see using the its senses, instead of your own, until your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
>
>***One with the Word (7/Recharges on long rest).*** While you are holding the book and its spectral mind is manifest, you cause the two of you to teleport, swapping places. Moreover, if you die but at least one spell remains in your Awakened Spellbook, you can return to life 1 minute later within 5 feet of the book. You revive with 1 hit point. Then roll 3d6. The book loses spells of your choice that have a combined spell level equal to that roll or higher. Thereafter, you are incapable of casting the lost spells, even if you find them on a scroll or in another spellbook. The only way to restore your ability to cast one of the lost spells is through the [wish](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/wish/) spell, which can restore one spell to the book per casting.

>#### Reactions
>***War Caster: Opportunity Cast.*** When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature. This does not count against your ability to cast a spell during your turn.
>
>
>#### Bonus Actions
>***Manifest Mind.*** While the book is on your person, you can cause the mind to manifest as a Tiny spectral construct, hovering in an unoccupied space of your choice within 60 feet of you. This presence is intangible and doesn't occupy its space, and it sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It looks like a ghostly tome, a cascade of text, or a scholar from the past (your choice). The spectral mind has {npc.levels('Wizard') + npc.INTbonus()} hit points, and it uses your Armor Class and saving throw modifiers. While manifested, the spectral mind can hear and see, and it has darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
>
>***Wizardly Quill.*** You magically create a Tiny quill in your free hand. The quill doesn't require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface. The gold and time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook are halved if you use the quill for the transcription. You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you. This quill disappears if you create another one or if you die.

>#### Equipment
>Quarterstaff OR dagger
>
>Component pouch OR Arcane focus
>
>Scholar's pack OR Explorer's pack
>
>***Spellbook.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots; the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp per level of spell.Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Copying a spell from your spellbook into another spellbook costs half this amount (in time and gold), since you know it already.
>
>***Awakened Spellbook.*** You have awakened arcane sentience within your spellbook. If necessary, you can replace the book over the course of a short rest by using your Wizardly Quill to write arcane sigils in a blank book or a magic spellbook to which you're attuned. At the end of the rest, your spellbook's consciousness is summoned into the new book, which the consciousness transforms into your spellbook, along with all its spells. If the previous book still existed somewhere, all the spells vanish from its pages.

#### Description
***Ideals:*** *Life/Knowledge/Greater good.*

***Motivation:*** *Enacting revenge.*

***Appearance:*** *Adult*, *Ragged, dirty clothes.*

***Talents:*** *Expert painter.*

***Mannerisms:*** *Refers to themself in the third person.*

***Interactions (with others):*** *Honest*.

***Bond:*** *Drawn to a special place.*

***Secret:*** *Has a secret pet (not necessarily tamed).*

***Flaw:*** *Can't express emotions.*

***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: High Elf.*** High elves and wood elves are, by this point in Azgaarnoth's history, fairly well intermixed and are found in most locations all across Azgaarnoth; at this point in their evolution, no non-elf can tell the difference between them.

***Class: Wizard.*** Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more.

***Arcane Tradition: Scribe.*** Among wizards, the Scriveners school is the most bookish. Its primary mission: recording discoveries (particularly those magical in nature) in tomes and scrolls so that wizardry can flourish. And while every wizard values their spellbook, a Scrivener dedicates themself to magically awakening their book, turning it into a trusted companion. All wizards study their spellbooks, but a scribe talks to theirs.

***Feat: Durable.*** You are hardy and resilient.

***Feat: War Caster.*** You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning useful techniques.

***Feat: Observant.*** You are quick to notice details of your environment.

***Feat: Keen Mind.*** You have a mind that can track time, direction, and detail with uncanny precision.
