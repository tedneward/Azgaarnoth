***Race: Human.*** Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They live fully in the present — making them well suited to the adventuring life — but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.Owing to the prodigious rate at which humans reproduce, they are the dominant species of the Azgaarnothian lands. Owing to the 8,000-plus years of intermixing, humans characteristics are all over the map--different skin tones, different complexions, heights, weights, and so on.

***Feat: Elemental Touched.*** You've been exposed to the primordial magic of the Elemental Planes, granting you a measure of control over the natural world around you.



***Class: Sorcerer.*** Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

***Sorcerous Origin: Storm.*** Storm sorcerers channel the power of the thunderstorm: The gale-force winds, the crashing of thunder, the pelting rain. This connection to the storm echoes radiates out of them, giving them some control over wind and weather in their immediate area. Their magic embraces the air and storm, and their connection allows them to communicate with the creatures born of the power of the storm.
