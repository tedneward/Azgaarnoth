>***Arcane Recovery.*** Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can recover up to 10 levels of expended spell slots, none of which can be 6th level or higher.
>
>***Durable Magic.*** While you maintain concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all saving throws.
>
>***Keen Mind.*** You always know which way is north, the number of hours left before the next sunrise or sunset, and you can accurately recall anything you have seen or heard within the past month.
>
>***Power Surge.*** Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power surge to deal 10 extra force damage to that target. You can store a maximum number of 5 power surges. Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a spell with [dispel magic](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/dispel-magic/) or [counterspell](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/counterspell/), you gain one power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you foiled. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.
>
>***Shadow-Touched Spells.*** You can also cast your Shadow-Touched spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
>
>***Signature Spells.*** You gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
>
>***Spell Mastery.*** By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

>***Arcane Deflection.*** When you are hit by an attack or you fail a saving throw, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC against that attack or a +4 bonus to that saving throw. When you use this feature, you can't cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn. You cause magical energy to arc from you, causing up to three creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you to each take10 force damage.
>
>***War Caster: Opportunity Cast.*** When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature. This does not count against your ability to cast a spell during your turn.

>
>***Spellbook.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots; the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp per level of spell.Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Copying a spell from your spellbook into another spellbook costs half this amount (in time and gold), since you know it already.

***Race: Genasi.*** Thought to trace their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements.

***Fire Genasi.*** Descended from efreet, the genies of the Elemental Plane of Fire, fire genasi channel the flamboyant and often destructive nature of flame. They show their heritage in their skin tones, which can range from deep charcoal to shades of red and orange. Some bear skin tones common to humanity but with fiery marks, such as slowly swirling lights under their skin that resemble embers or glowing red lines tracing over their bodies like cracks. Fire genasi hair can resemble threads of fire or sooty smoke.

***Class: Wizard.*** Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more.

***Arcane Tradition: War Magic.*** Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents' attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters' magical energy against them.

***Feat: War Caster.*** You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning useful techniques.
