>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Guiding Whispers.*** The [guidance](../../Magic/Spells/guidance.md) cantrip doesn't count against the number of bard cantrips you know, and a range of 60 feet when you cast it.
>
>***Jack of All Trades.*** You can add 3 to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.
>
>***Lucky (3/Recharges on long rest).*** Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20 and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.
>
>***Magical Inspiration.*** If a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.
>
>***Magical Secrets.*** You have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Two of your known spells at 10th level, two more at 14th level, and two more at 18th level can be from any classes, including this one.
>
>***Shadow-Touched Spells.*** You can also cast your Shadow-Touched spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
>
>***Song of Rest.*** You can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.
>
>***Spirit Session (Recharges on long rest).*** You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done during a short or long rest) using your Spiritual Focus. You can conduct the ritual with 7 creatures (including yourself). At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class.The spell you choose must be level 7 or less, the spell must of a level you can cast, and it must be in the school of divination or necromancy. The chosen spell counts as a bard spell for you but doesn't count against the number of bard spells you know. You know the chosen spell until you start a long rest.
>
>***Spiritual Focus.*** You can use the following objects as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells: a candle, a crystal ball, a talking board, a tarokka deck, or a skull. When you cast a bard spell that deals damage or restores hit points through this Spiritual Focus, roll a d6 and add that to the result.
>
>***Stealthy.*** If you are hidden, you can move up to 10 feet in the open without revealing yourself if you end the move in a position where you're not clearly visible.
>
>***Superior Inspiration.*** When you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.
>
>#### Actions
>***Countercharm.*** You can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).
>
>***Tell the Tale.*** You choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the Tales from the Beyond tale's effect. Once you do so, you can't bestow the tale's effect again until you roll it again.

The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no other creature; **8: Dark Spirit.** You speak a dreadful tale of a slayer in the dark.

Each creature of the target's choice it can see within 30 feet of it must make a Strength saving throw (DC 21), taking 2d12 force damage on a failed save and is knocked prone.
