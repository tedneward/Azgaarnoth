>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

#### Description
***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: Bright Elf.*** The bright elves are one of the oldest subraces of elves. Due to their long years of close association with the Eldar they have an innate connection to the celestial light and song of creation. They are more lawful than other elven societies, and they value obedience as well as conformity. Many bright elves believe themselves to be the purest and most original form of elf, and see other elven subraces as little better than non-elves, but others among their ranks  are more accepting, often chiding their haughtier peers and worrying that such thinking is what led to the Fall.
As a bright elf, your body and soul are infused with light. A bright elf's skin is bronze, silvery, pearly, or pale white, and their hair is golden blond, platinum blond, or silvery white. Their eyes are usually golden or silvery gray, with streaks of white radiating from their pupils like a starburst.
