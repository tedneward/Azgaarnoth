>___
>***Brutal Critical.*** You roll three additional weapon damage dice when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
>
>***Feral Instinct.*** You have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.
>
>***Indomitable Might.*** If your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.
>
>***Lunar Resolve (Recharges on long rest).*** When you use your Were-Beast Form or Feral Shape feature, you can regain 20 hit points.
>
>***Lurker Instincts.*** You never have to slow your travel pace to move stealthily, and you can always watch for danger while traveling, even when you are performing an activity.
>
>***Relentless Rage (Resets on short or long rest).*** If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5.
>
>***Second Skin.*** While you are raging, any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage that you take from such attacks is reduced by 3 and can't reduce your hit points below half of your hit point maximum. You have advantage on saving throws against curses, diseases, and effects that would reveal your true form against your will.
>
>***Stealthy.*** If you are hidden, you can move up to 10 feet in the open without revealing yourself if you end the move in a position where you're not clearly visible.
>
>#### Actions
>***Bite (Were-Beast Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to Hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 1d8 + 5 piercing damage. Your bite does not transfer the curse of lycanthropy unless you are cursed with that affliction.
>
>***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d6 + 4 piercing damage.
>
>***Feral Shape (Recharges on long rest).*** You transform into a [Tiger](../../Creatures/Cats.md#tiger). While transformed, your statistics for your hit points, AC, and ability scores remain unchanged, and you keep any special senses your normal form possesses. Your natural weapons in Feral Shape form count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance or immunity. You also benefit from the special traits for your bond's Were-Beast Form, but not the bonus to AC or damage rolls. Instead of the beast's normal size, you choose to be either Large or Medium when you transform. If you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, you use the beast's Dexterity score for the check instead of your own. You also benefit from the special traits for your bond's Were-Beast Form, but not the bonus to AC or damage rolls.
>
>***Multiattack.*** You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
>
>***Reckless Attack.*** When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
>
>***Terrifying Howl.*** You howl, and creatures not allied with you within a 60' radius must make a Wisdom save (DC 15) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
>
>#### Reactions
>***Instinctive Pounce.*** When a creature ends its turn within 15 feet of you, you move up to half your speed to a space closer to the creature. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
>
>
>#### Bonus Actions
>***Rage (6/Recharges on long rest).*** Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you fall unconscious. You can end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.  You can move up to half your speed as part of this bonus action. If you aren't wearing heavy armor, you gain the following benefits: You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws; When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +4 bonus to the damage roll; You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
>
>***Rampage.*** After you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the you can move up to half your speed and make a Bite attack.
>
>***Vicious Bite.*** You make one Bite attack.
>
>***Were-Beast Transformation (Recharges on long rest or another usage of Rage).*** You transform into a were-beast form, and you count as a beast in addition to your normal type or types. (You can also do this as part of the bonus action used to Rage.) The transformation lasts indefinitely or until you are reduced to 0 hit points. You can use your action to end the transformation early, but only after at least 1 hour. While you are not wearing heavy armor in this form, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and damage rolls of your weapon attacks that use Strength. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that are not using silvered weapons. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet, your jumping distance is tripled, and once per turn, when you move at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and hit it with your next melee weapon attack on that turn, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 19) or be knocked prone, with advantage if it is larger than you. If you're raging and it falls prone, you can immediately use your bonus action to make a bite attack against it, dealing 10 extra damage on a hit. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or having your emotions changed by magic, and you are immune to any effect that can only target beasts unless you choose to be affected.

#### Description
***Ideals:*** *Freedom/Knowledge/Retribution.*

***Appearance:*** *Missing fingers.*

***Talents:*** *Draws beautifully.*

***Mannerisms:*** *Frequently uses the wrong word.*

***Interactions with others:*** *Frequently rude to others.*

***Bond:*** *Protective of close family members.*

***Flaw:*** *Secret crime or misdeed.*

***Race: Gnoll.*** Gnolls are brutal hunters with a demonic ancestry who are fiercely loyal to their pack.

***Class: Barbarian.*** Barbarians are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.

***Primal Path: Path of the Werebeast.*** The curse of lycanthropy can be a boon to those who embrace the power it provides. Barbarians that are used to the altered mental state of their rage often have less difficulty with controlling the curse and its corrupting influences on their behavior, but no one can easily tame their inner were-beast once it is unleashed.

***Feat: Vicious Bite.*** You have developed a ferocious bite attack that even other gnolls fear.

***Feat: Terrifying Howl.*** Your howl is that of the stalking predator, and can terrify your quarry.

***Feat: Stealthy.*** You know how best to hide.
