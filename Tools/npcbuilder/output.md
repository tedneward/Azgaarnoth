>***Careful Observation.*** If you spend 1 hour observing a creature, you can then spend 8 hours crafting a disguise you can quickly don to mimic that creature. Making the disguise requires a disguise kit. You must make checks as normal to disguise yourself, but you can assume the disguise as an action.
>
>***Channel Divinity (3/Recharges on short or long rest).*** See below for the details of each use.
>
>***Larger than Life (Recharges on a long rest).*** When you make a melee attack, you can increase that attack's reach by 5 feet.
>
>***Spirit of the Cat Lord.*** You need to be wearing no or light armor to gain these benefits.
>
>#### Actions
>***Channel Divinity: Turn Undead.***  You can use one of your uses of Channel Divinity to turn undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, if it is a CR of 4 or lower it is destroyed; otherwise it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
>
>***Channel Divinity: Underfoot.*** You create a clowder (basically, a swarm) of illusory cats that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The clowder appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the clowder up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the clowder's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your clowder are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, due to the distraction of the clowder. If your clowder of illusory cats is within 5 feet of a creature that makes an attack roll against a target other than you, you may use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll. Also, if a creature is within 5 feet of your clowder and makes a saving throw, you may use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll.
>
>***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 1d4 + -1 slashing damage
>
>***Divine Intervention (Recharges on long rest/seven days).*** Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than {npc.levels('Cleric')}, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
>
>***Divine Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 2d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target.
>
>***Feline Agility.*** When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you canâ€™t use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.
>
>***Spellscarred Strike (Recharges after the end of your next turn).*** When you strike an enemy, you can lash out with a flicker of blue fire that passes through their flesh and removes something vital. You make an Unarmed Strike against a target within 5 feet. You may use either your Strength modifier or your Dexterity modifier to modify the attack roll, but you do not add either ability modifier to damage. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage and 1d4 force damage. The next time the target makes an attack roll before the end of its next turn, it coughs up sickly blue-black blood, and must either accept disadvantage on that attack roll or take 1d8 necrotic damage.

#### Description
Ideals: Greater good/Independence/Life

Appearance: Distinctive posture (crooked or rigid)

Talents: Skilled actor

Mannerisms: Uses flowery speech or long words

Interactions with others: Quick to cut off others when speaking with them

Bond: Loyal to a benefactor, patron, or employer

Flaw: Overpowering greed

***Race: Tabaxi.*** Tabaxi are catlike humanoids driven by curiosity to wander, often to collect interesting artifacts, gather tales and stories, and lay eyes on all the world's wonders. Ultimate travelers, the inquisitive tabaxi rarely stay in one place for long. Their innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, no treasures or legends lost.

***Tabaxi Personality: Obsession.*** A lost civilization

***Tabaxi Personality: Quirk.*** You never wear the same outfit twice, unless you absolutely must.

***Class: Cleric.*** Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.

***Divine Domain: Cat.*** Clerics of the Cat Lord are rare and are typically mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They are equally likely to be by your side up until the moment trouble begins as scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions.

***Feat: Quick-Fingered.*** Your nimble fingers and agility let you perform sleight of hand.

***Feat: Master of Disguise.*** You have honed your ability to shape your personality and to read the personalities of others.

***Feat: Spellscarred Savant.*** Your mastery of your spellscar allows you to tap into raw magical energy, either to harm others with its sizzling power or invigorate your own body. As your power grows, you can wield the fury of this raw magic as easily as a warrior does a blade, calling down the untempered essence of magic gone mad to burn foes to ash.
