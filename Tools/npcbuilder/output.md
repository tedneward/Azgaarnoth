#### Description
***Ideals:*** *Moderation/Knowledge/Logic.*

***Motivation:*** *Fulfilling a last wish.*

***Appearance:*** *Teenager*, *Tattoos.*

***Talents:*** *Plays a musical instrument.*

***Mannerisms:*** *Frequently uses the wrong word.*

***Interactions (with others):*** *Shy*.

***Bond:*** *Dedicated to fulfilling a personal life goal.*

***Secret:*** *Has an incurable illness.*

***Flaw:*** *Quick to make assumptions.*

***Race: Orc.*** Orcs are burly raiders with prominent lower canines that resemble tusks. They gather in tribes that satisfy their bloodlust by slaying any humanoids that stand against them.

***Class: Warlock.*** Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular.

***Otherworldly Patron: The Witch(es).*** Your patron is a powerful hag, usually a Grandmother hag, or even a coven of hags, which has taken an interest in your life. Hags are defined by their love of misery in other creatures, which often means they will only take on students and warlocks when the net suffering to be gained in the long run seems more than likely to offset the inconvenience. Some hags will even go so far as to blackmail or bribe certain influential figures into accepting a warlock pact, as part of some grand unknowable scheme, or perhaps to complete a coven. All forms of hags are able to grant pacts in this manner, and on rare occasions an entire coven of lesser hags will use their magic to grant a warlock pact to some unfortunate individual.

***Feat: Animal Handler.*** You master the techniques needed to train and handle animals.

***Feat: Investigator.*** You have an eye for detail and can pick out the smallest clues.
