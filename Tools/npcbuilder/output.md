>___
>***Brutal Critical.*** You roll three additional weapon damage dice when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
>
>***Feral Instinct.*** You have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.
>
>***Font of Fury.*** When you cast a spell while raging, attack rolls against you are rolled with advantage until the beginning of your next turn. In addition, your rage ends early if you are knocked unconscious, if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature, cast a spell, or taken damage since the end of your previous turn. Otherwise your rage works normally.
>
>***Indomitable Might.*** If your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.
>
>***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.
>
>***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
>
>***Relentless Rage (Resets on short or long rest).*** If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5.
>
>***Savage Attacker.*** Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee weapon attack, you can reroll the weapon's damage dice and use either total.
>
>***Stealthy.*** If you are hidden, you can move up to 10 feet in the open without revealing yourself if you end the move in a position where you're not clearly visible.
>
>***Surprise Attack.*** If you surprise a creature and hit it with an attack on your first turn in combat, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage to it. You can use this trait only once per combat.
>
>#### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
>
>***Reckless Attack.*** When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
>

***Race: Bugbear.*** Bugbears were the lazy bullies of the Hordes, and the rest of Azgaarnoth is grateful that these physical specimens of might have generally chosen the easiest path rather than seek to assert themselves collectively as a race. As the only members of the Hordes that might have challenged the minotaurs for primacy over the Hordes, bugbears effectively ceded primacy over the Hordes to the bull-men by choosing instead to focus on rest and sleep and lethargy.

***Class: Barbarian.*** Barbarians are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.

***Primal Path: Path of the Rage Mage.*** A rage mage taps into the primal essence of magic, using her own natural anger and frenzy to channel the arcane power in flashy, flamboyant ways. Like any barbarian, a rage mage is often the product of a less civilized society. A rage mage is not necessarily stupid, however, and should be feared for it.

***Feat: Burglar.*** You pride yourself on your quickness and your close study of certain clandestine activities.

***Feat: Stealthy.*** You know how best to hide.

***Feat: Savage Attacker.*** You know how to use your weapons for maximum effect in combat.
