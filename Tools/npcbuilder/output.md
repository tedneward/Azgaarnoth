If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

#### Description
***Ideals:*** *Whimsy/Change/Balance.*

***Appearance:*** *Pronounced scar on face.*

***Talents:*** *Plays a musical instrument.*

***Mannerisms:*** *Frequently uses the wrong word.*

***Interactions with others:*** *Friendly when talking to others.*

***Bond:*** *Captivated by a romantic interest.*

***Flaw:*** *Prone to sudden suspicion.*

***Race: Human.*** Humans were the servant race of the Eldar and flourished and took over much of the lands after the Fall. It is not clear if humans were created by the Eldar, or were uplifted by them. Either way, humans owe their civilization to the initial one built by the Eldar, inheriting it after the Fall.

***Feat: Elemental Touched.*** You've been exposed to the primordial magic of the Elemental Planes, granting you a measure of control over the natural world around you.



***Class: Cleric.*** Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.

***Divine Domain: Abandoned.*** Some clerics worship dead powers, or gods that prefer not to give powers to the unworthy, or the unproven. And some have lost their god's trust, leaving them without their power. These are the clerics of the Abandoned Domain.

***Feat: Tough.*** You are harder to kill.

***Feat: Resilient.*** You are harder to kill than most.

***Feat: Keen Mind.*** You have a mind that can track time, direction, and detail with uncanny precision.
