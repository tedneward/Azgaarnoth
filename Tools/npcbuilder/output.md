>#### Reactions
>***Power Surge.*** When you hit a creature with an attack, or it fails a saving throw against a spell you cast, you expend one superiority die and deal force damage equal to the result of the superiority die. If the spell affects more than one creature, you choose which creature takes the additional damage.
>
>***Spell Dispersal.*** If you are required to make a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, you expend one superiority die and add the number rolled on the superiority die to your saving throw. You apply this bonus after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined.
>
>***Weave Ward.*** If you are hit by an attack whilst not wearing armor, you expend one superiority die and add the number rolled to your AC until the end of this turn. If the attack still hits, you take half damage instead. You can apply this bonus after the die is rolled, but before the outcome is determined.

>***Spellbook.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots; the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp per level of spell.Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Copying a spell from your spellbook into another spellbook costs half this amount (in time and gold), since you know it already.

#### Description
***Ideals:*** *Life/No limits/Balance.*

***Appearance:*** *Unusual hair color.*

***Talents:*** *Master of disguise.*

***Mannerisms:*** *Speaks in unusually formal manner.*

***Interactions with others:*** *Blustering when talking to others.*

***Bond:*** *Dedicated to fulfilling a personal life goal.*

***Flaw:*** *Prone to sudden suspicion.*

***Race: Human.*** Humans were the servant race of the Eldar and flourished and took over much of the lands after the Fall. It is not clear if humans were created by the Eldar, or were uplifted by them. Either way, humans owe their civilization to the initial one built by the Eldar, inheriting it after the Fall.

***Feat: Keen Mind.*** You have a mind that can track time, direction, and detail with uncanny precision.



***Class: Wizard.*** Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more.

***Arcane Tradition: Arcane Experimenter.*** The wizardry disciplines tend towards fastidious structure, dedicated study, and cautious experimentation. The formulas for new spells and magical items can take decades of research and testing before they are proven stable.But there are those who believe to truly learn, to truly understand, requires not only careful analysis but practice; even if that process is considered reckless. The quickest way to test if a spell formula works isn't to pore over it for months or years, assessing its flaws, but to simply try it in a variety of situations and environments, and against a variety of foes.
