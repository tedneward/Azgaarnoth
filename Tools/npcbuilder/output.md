>***Blood Frenzy.*** You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.

>***Limited Amphibiousness.*** You can breathe air and water, but need to be submerged at least once every 8 hours to avoid dehydration. For each 8 hours period you do not submerge, you suffer one additional level of exhaustion.
>
>***Shark Telepathy.*** You can communicate simple ideas with sharks. They may understand you, but you have no way of understanding them.

Creatures take half as much damage and are not pushed and knocked down on a successful saving throw. Creatures of the Huge size and larger are not pushed back and knocked prone. You must not be in the air when you do this.

>***Channel Divinity: Turn Undead.***  You can use one of your uses of Channel Divinity to turn undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, if it is a CR of 1 or lower it is destroyed; otherwise it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
