>***Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting.*** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
>
>***Spirit Path (Recharges on short or long rest).*** As long as you have at least one spirit you have not invoked, you have proficiency in Religion and Survival. If you have called upon all your spirits, you lose this feature.
>
>***Durable.*** When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).
>
>***Ghostly Counsel.*** As a free action you can call upon any one of your spirits to double your proficiency bonus in one skill of your choice, in place of the usual bonus that spirit provides.
>
>***Resurgence.*** You regain access to two spirits of your choice if you have no spirits remaining to call upon when you roll initiative.
>
>***Action Surge (2/Recharges on short or long rest).*** On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.
>
>***Ghostly Choir.*** You gain the services of several ghostly spirits. You can only benefit from one spirit per attack or action. Under normal conditions (except as noted), only you can see your choir or hear their voices. These spirits can, however, be detected by means of [detect magic](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/detect-magic/), and can be seen with a *gem of true seeing*. The ghosts are not treated as undead or any type of creature--they cannot be attacked, harmed, exorcised, or banished. Once you've gained a particular spirit's benefit, you cannot call upon that same spirit again until after you've completed a short or long rest. Currently you have a choir consisting of the spirits of Berserker,Butcher,Crone,Shield-Mate,Coward,Fallen Hero,Healer,Skald,Stag,Monster
>
>***Spirit: Berserker.*** His rage clouds your mind, blocking your foe's honeyed words. You do not summon this spirit, but rather he appears unbidden. If you fail a saving throw against an effect that imposes the charmed condition, each round thereafter at the beginning of your turn you may reroll the saving throw with advantage. If you succeed, the charm effect ends. If you fail, however, you suffer 20 hit points of damage. This feature continues until you break free of the charm or drop to 0 hit points--you cannot voluntarily end this feature.
>
>***Indomitable (3/Recharges on long rest).*** You can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
>
>#### Actions
>***Horns.*** Melee Weapon Attack: 12 to it, reach 5ft., one creature. Hit: 1d6 + 5 piercing damage. Your horns grant you advantage on all checks made to shove a creature, but not to avoid being shoved yourself.
>
>***Spirit: Shield-Mate.*** A ghostly, flickering image of a shield-bearing warrior appears adjacent to you for 3 rounds. As long as the ghost remains, treat your armor class as if you wielded a shield.
>
>***Multiattack.*** You can attack four times whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
>
>***Spirit: Coward.*** If you take the Disengage action to move away from an enemy, your speed increases by half for that round only. Unlike the other spirits, you do not lose the coward feature after using him. Instead, choose one of your other ghostly choir. You instead lose that spirit's feature until you complete a short or long rest.
>
>***Spirit: Healer.*** You may expend 5 of your available recovery hit dice. Alternatively, you can ask the spirit to infuse one of your allies within 30 feet that you can see with the benefits of one of your recovery dice.
>
>***Spirit: Skald.*** Each ally within 30 feet who can hear you can either automatically succeed at a death saving throw or remove one of the following conditions: charmed, frightened, poisoned, or one level of exhaustion. You gain no benefit from this feature.
>
>***Spirit: Monster.*** Choose a number of enemy creatures within 30 feet that you can see, to a maximum of 7. Each creature must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18) or become frightened for 3 rounds.
>
>#### Reactions
>***Spirit: Crone.*** When an effect requires you to make a saving throw, you can draw on this spirit and have advantage on that saving throw. If you cannot take a reaction, you cannot call upon the crone.
>
>***Spirit: Fallen Hero.*** He bolsters your reserves and helps you overcome hopeless odds. When an attack would drop you to 0 hit points, you can summon this spirit. You remain at 1 hit point, standing and conscious. If you take further damage that drops you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.
>
>
>#### Bonus Actions
>***Goring Rush.*** When you use the Dash action during your turn, you can make a melee attack with your horns as a bonus action.

>
>***Second Wind (Recharges on short or long rest).*** On your turn, you can regain 1d10 + 20 hit points.
>
>***Spirit: Butcher.*** Choose 7 enemies that you can see within 30 feet. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 18) or suffer 2 points of necrotic damage. You regain half of this amount as temporary hit points.
>

#### Description
***Race: Minotaur.*** 

***Class: Fighter.*** Fighters share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. They are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

***Martial Archetype: Ghost Warrior.*** The Ghost Warrior draws upon the collective wisdom, knowledge, and experience of a choir of ghosts or other ancestral spirits. This choir remains bonded to them, invisible and silent until summoned, offering guidance until the warrior fulfills their destiny or perishes in battle. Such a choir includes ancestral spirits, as well as spirits of former protectors of their clan and legendary warriors slain in combat--and perhaps even an enemy or rival slain by their hand. When the Ghost Warrior needs insight or advice, they listen to these spirits and--if wise--heed their counsel. In those moments where the ghost warrior needs an edge against enemies, they allow one of the spirits to possess their body. When the time comes and the ghost warrior falls, then they become part of another warrior's choir, continuing the cycle of life and death.

***Feat: Tough.*** You are harder to kill.

***Feat: Durable.*** You are hardy and resilient.
