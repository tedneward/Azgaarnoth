>***Arcane Recovery.*** Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level of 10, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
>
>***Aura of Magic.*** You now emit a 10 foot magical aura. This aura dispels all illusions that come into contact with the aura, and you can sense whenever a creature enters or exits your aura, but not where they are in your aura.
>
>***Enhanced Spellcasting.*** When you cast a cantrip or spell that deals damage and roll a 1 on a damage roll, you may reroll the die. You must then use the new roll.
>
>***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.
>
>***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
>
>***Signature Spells.*** You gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
>
>***Spell Mastery.*** By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

>***Spellbook.*** Contents: 
>
>***Studied.*** You have advantage on any Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (History) checks related to magic.
>
>***Surprise Attack.*** If you surprise a creature and hit it with an attack on your first turn in combat, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage to it. You can use this trait only once per combat.
>
>***War Caster: Concentration.*** You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage.
>
>***War Caster: Somaticism.*** You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.
>
>#### Actions
>***Ancient Glyph (Recharges on long rest).*** You place an ancient glyph of magic on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. For 1 minute, they have disadvantage on saving throws caused by spells you cast, they take 1d10 psychic damage at the start of their turn, and you have advantage on any saving throws due to the target's actions, bonus actions, reactions, or other activities.
>
>***Wizard Spellcasting (Int, at level 20. Recharges on long rest).*** 24 spells prepared. Spell save DC: 19, Spell attack bonus: +11

>***War Caster: Opportunity Cast.*** When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature. This does not count against your ability to cast a spell during your turn.

>***Spellbook.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots; the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp per level of spell.Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. Copying a spell from your spellbook into another spellbook costs half this amount (in time and gold), since you know it already.

#### Description
***Ideals:*** *Fairness/Greater good/Knowledge.*

***Appearance:*** *Braided beard or hair.*

***Talents:*** *Skilled mime.*

***Mannerisms:*** *Uses flowery speech or long words.*

***Interactions with others:*** *Curious when speaking with others.*

***Bond:*** *Protective of colleagues or compatriots.*

***Flaw:*** *Quick to make assumptions.*

***Race: Bugbear.*** Bugbears were the lazy bullies of the Hordes, and the rest of Azgaarnoth is grateful that these physical specimens of might have generally chosen the easiest path rather than seek to assert themselves collectively as a race. The only members of the Hordes that might have challenged the minotaurs for primacy over the Hordes, bugbears instead chose to focus on their own indolence rather than leadership and control, and the average bugbear continues that tradition to this day.

***Class: Wizard.*** Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more.

***Arcane Tradition: Ancient Magic.*** You have stumbled upon some source of ancient magic (often--but not always--Eldar magic), whether it be spellcasting notes, an old magical item, magic runes, or something else which you are only starting to unravel the secrets of. The only thing that you know for certain is that this source of magic will enhance your spellcasting in some way.

***Feat: War Caster.*** You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning useful techniques.
