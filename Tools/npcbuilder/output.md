#### Description
***Ideals:*** *Discovery/Balance/Responsibility.*

***Motivation:*** *Fulfilling a last wish.*

***Appearance:*** *Child*, *Pronounced scars all over arms.*

***Race: Dragonborn.*** Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

***Silver Dragonborn.***

***Class: Sorcerer.*** Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

***Sorcerous Origin: Shadow.*** Your innate magic comes from the Shadowfell. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its fell energy and transformed in some fundamental manner.

***Shadow Sorcerer Quirk.*** $When you are asleep, you don't appear to breathe (though you must still breathe to survive).

***Feat: Shadow-Touched.*** You learn how to bend shadows from your experience with the Shadowfell.
