#### Description

***Appearance:*** *Bald.*

***Talents:*** *Great with animals.*

***Mannerisms:*** *Uses flowery speech or long words.*

***Interactions with others:*** *Honest with others.*

***Race: Goblin.*** Originally a subterranean folk that came to Azgaarnoth as part of the Hordes, goblins can now be found in every corner of Azgaarnoth, often beside their bugbear and hobgoblin kin. Goblins hae thrived in dangerous environments thanks to a special knack for finding the weak spots in foes larger than themselves and for getting out of trouble. Originally the lackeys and servants of their larger goblinoid kin, now many goblins pursue their own destinies, escaping the plots of archfey, gods, and would-be warlords.

***Class: Cleric.*** Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.

***Divine Domain: Plague.*** Clerics of the Plague domain are conduits of disease, decay, and pestilence. They wield the power of sickness to weaken their enemies and bring suffering to those who oppose them.
