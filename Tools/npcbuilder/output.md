>***Aspect of the Beast: Eagle.*** You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.
>
>***Athletic.*** When you are prone, standing up uses only 5 feet of your movement. You can make a running long jump or a running high jump after moving only 5 feet on foot, rather than 10 feet.
>
>***Brutal Critical.*** You roll three additional weapon damage dice when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
>
>***Durable.*** When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).
>
>***Feral Instinct.*** You have advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.
>
>***Grappling.*** You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.
>
>***Indomitable Might.*** If your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.
>
>***Relentless Endurance (Recharges on long rest.)*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead.
>
>***Relentless Rage (Resets on short or long rest).*** If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5.
>
>***Savage Attacks.*** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
>
>***Totem Spirit: Bear.*** While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage.
>
>#### Actions
>***Great Weapon Master.*** Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.
>
>***Multiattack.*** You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
>
>***Pin.*** If you are grappling a creature, you can make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.
>
>***Reckless Attack.*** When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
>
>***Spirit Seeker.*** You can cast [beast sense](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/beast-sense/) as a ritual. You can cast [speak with animals](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/speak-with-animals/) as a ritual.

***Race: Half-Orc.*** When alliances between humans and orcs are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs, savage fury, and impressive cunning.



***Class: Barbarian.*** Barbarians are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.

***Primal Path: Path of the Totem Warrior.*** The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.

***Feat: Great Weapon Master.*** You've learned to put the weight of a weapon to your advantage, letting its momentum empower your strikes.
