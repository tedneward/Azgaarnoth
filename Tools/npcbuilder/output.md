>***Alchemical Improvement.*** Over the course of any short rest, you can temporarily improve the potency of one potion of healing of any rarity. To use this benefit, you must have alchemist's supplies with you, and the potion must be within reach. If the potion is drunk no more than 1 hour after the short rest ends, the creature drinking the potion can forgo the potion's die roll and regains the maximum number of hit points that the potion can restore.
>
>***Combat Inspiration.*** A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.
>
>***Dwarven Resilience.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison.
>
>***Jack of All Trades.*** You can add 3 to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.
>
>***Lucky (3/Recharges on long rest).*** Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20 and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.
>
>***Magical Inspiration.*** If a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.
>
>***Magical Secrets.*** You have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Two of your known spells at 10th level, two more at 14th level, and two more at 18th level can be from any classes, including this one.
>
>***Piercer.*** Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack that deals piercing damage, you can reroll one of the attack's damage dice, and you must use the new roll. When you score a critical hit that deals piercing damage to a creature, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the extra piercing damage the target takes.
>
>***Song of Rest.*** You can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.
>
>***Stonecunning.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, it is considered proficient in the History skill and add doubles its proficiency bonus to the check.
>
>***Superior Inspiration.*** When you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.
>
>#### Actions
>***Alchemical Identification.*** You can identify one potion within 5 feet of you, as if you had tasted it. You must see the liquid for this benefit to work.
>
>***Countercharm.*** You can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).
>
>***Multiattack.*** You can attack twice when you take the Attack action on your turn.
>
>***Bard Spellcasting (Cha, at level 20. Recharges on long rest).*** 5 cantrips known. 23 spells prepared. Spell save DC: 15, Spell attack bonus: +7

>***Frigid Retaliation (7/Recharges on long rest).*** Immediately after a creature you can see within 30 feet of you hits you with an attack roll and deals damage, you can retaliate with a conjured blast of ice.

***Race: Dwarf.*** Dwarves are hardy folk, often usually working in skilled professions. Some have taken up more agrarian roots, choosing to embrace the world of sun and rain, but many dwarves find themselves naturally drawn to lives of practiced skills. Take careful note, though: despite their history, dwarves are just as fond of scroll and pen as they are crossbow and axe. Traditions hold among the dwarven clans, one of those being martial exercise, so most dwarves are trained in some form of weaponry, and likely to fight if antagonized.

***Hill Dwarf.*** The hill and mountain dwarves are essentially small genetic differences within the dwarven bloodline, but at this point in Azgaarnoth's history they are essentially meaningless as cultural differentiators--hill dwarves often work in the hills as part of their guild/clan, and mountain dwarves are often found in mountains for similar reasons. In fact, it's more common to see them in cities than in hills or mountains. Most non-dwarves can't even tell the difference between them.

***Class: Bard.*** Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain.

***Bardic College: College of Valor.*** Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.

***Feat: Strike of the Giants.*** You have absorbed primeval magic that gives you an echo of the might of giants.

***Feat: Fury of the Frost Giant.*** You've manifested the icy might emblematic of frost giants.

***Feat: Lucky.*** You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment.

***Feat: Alchemist.*** You have studied the secrets of alchemy and are an expert in its practice.

***Feat: Piercer.*** You have achieved a penetrating precision in combat.
