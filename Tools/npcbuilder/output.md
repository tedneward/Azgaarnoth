#### Description
***Ideals:*** *Greater good/Honor/Greed.*

***Appearance:*** *Pronounced scar on face.*

***Talents:*** *Great at Three-Dragon Ante.*

***Mannerisms:*** *Prone to declarations of excessive nature.*

***Interactions with others:*** *Ponderous when speaking with others.*

***Bond:*** *Drawn to a special place.*

***Flaw:*** *Possession of forbidden lore.*

***Race: Gnoll.*** Gnolls are brutal hunters with a demonic ancestry who are fiercely loyal to their pack.

***Class: Barbarian.*** Barbarians are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.

***Primal Path: Path of the Berserker.*** For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end -- that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

***Feat: Vicious Bite.*** You have developed a ferocious bite attack that even other gnolls fear.

***Feat: Terrifying Howl.*** Your howl is that of the stalking predator, and can terrify your quarry.

***Feat: Stealthy.*** You know how best to hide.
