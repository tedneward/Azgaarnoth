>***Acting.*** You have an advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person. You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.
>
>***Evasion.*** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
>
>***Insightful Manipulator.*** If you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice: Intelligence score; Wisdom score; Charisma score; Class levels (if any). At the DM's option, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature's history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.
>
>***Master of Intrigue.*** You can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, enabling you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.
>
>***Relentless Endurance (Recharges on long rest.)*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead.
>
>***Reliable Talent.*** Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
>
>***Savage Attacks.*** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
>
>***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, you can deal an extra 6d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

>#### Bonus Actions
>***Cunning Action.*** You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. You may also your Cunning Action to carefully aim your next attack. As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
>
>***Help.*** You can perform the Help action. Additionally, when you do this to aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than 5 feet of you, if the target can see or hear you.

#### Description
***Race: Half-Orc.*** When alliances between humans and orcs are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs, savage fury, and impressive cunning.



***Class: Rogue.*** Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

***Roguish Archetype: Mastermind.*** Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets they have. Many spies, courtiers, and schemers follow this archetype, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and favors are some of your favorite treasures.

***Feat: Actor.*** You are skilled at mimicry and dramatics.

***Feat: Burglar.*** You pride yourself on your quickness and your close study of certain clandestine activities.
