>***Martial Arts.*** When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.
>
>***Ki: Focused Aim.*** When you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase your attack roll by 2 for each of these ki points you spend, potentially turning the miss into a hit.
>
>***Ki: Stunning Strike.*** When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (against your Ki save DC) or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
>
>***Ki (5/Recharges on short or long rest).*** Ki save DC 12.
>
>***Bone Shard.*** When you would draw a weapon, you can instead extrude an osseous shard from your body, which detaches into your grasp. This shard is treated as a dagger.
>
>#### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** You can attack twice whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
>
>***Breath Weapon (0/Recharges on a long rest).*** You exhale venom in a line 5' x 30'. All creatures in the area must make a DEX saving throw, DC 11. A creature takes 2d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half on a successful one.
>
>***Unarmed Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage.
>
>***Ki: Marrow Storm.*** Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make 3 thrown weapon strikes. (*Ranged Weapon Attack* +4 to hit, range 60, one target. Hit: 1d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage.) If you would make an attack using this feature and you have no weapon drawn, you may draw one reflexively for no cost.
>
>***Ki: Quickened Healing.*** You can spend 2 ki points and regain 1d6 + 3 hit points.
>
>#### Reactions
>***Deflect Missiles.*** When you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, you deflect or catch the missile, reducing the damage you take from the attack by 1d10 + 6. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with a range of 20/60 using the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.
>
>***Slow Fall.*** Reduce any falling damage you take by {5 * npc.levels('Monk')}.
>
>
>#### Bonus Actions

#### Description
***Race: Dragonborn.*** 

***Gray Dragonborn.***

***Class: Monk.*** Monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

***Monastic Tradition: Way of Bone.*** The Way of Bone teaches that the body and soul must be flexible and enduring, weathering the ravages of time and surviving whatever harrowing forces the universe deigns to lay in our path. Monks of this discipline have control over their bones, using them for both offense and defence.
