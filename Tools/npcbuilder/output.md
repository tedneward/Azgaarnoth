#### Description
***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: Bright Elf.*** As a bright elf, your body and soul are infused with light. A bright elf's skin is bronze, silvery, pearly, or pale white, and their hair is golden blond, platinum blond, or silvery white. Their eyes are usually golden or silvery gray, with streaks of white radiating from their pupils like a starburst.
