>***Font of Magic (Recharges on long rest).*** You have 20 sorcery points.
>
>***Font of Magic: Empowering Reserves.*** When you make an ability check on your turn, you can spend 2 sorcery points to gain advantage on the check.
>
>***Magical Knack.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, you can add 4 to the roll. If you make the check intentionally (such as to examine something), you can expend 1 sorcery point to give yourself advantage on the roll.
>
>***Shadow-Touched Spells.*** You can also cast your Shadow-Touched spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
>
>#### Actions
>***Breath Weapon (7/Reharges on a long rest).*** You exhale destructive lightning in a line 5' x 30'. All creatures in the area must make a DEX saving throw, DC 17. A creature takes 4d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half on a successful one.
>
>***Font of Magic: Sorcerous Fortitude.*** You spend any number of sorcery points to roll a d4 for each point expended. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the total.
>
>***Forceful Concentration.*** While you are concentrating on exactly one spell, you cast a concentration spell without ending the first spell. The combined spell level of the two spells cannot exceed 9. Any Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration are made for each spell individually.
>
>***Mana Drain.*** You spend any number of sorcery points and target a creature you can see, forcing them to make a Charisma saving throw (DC 19). On a failed save, the target loses unused spell slots with a combined spell level equal to the number of sorcery points spent, or half that amount on a successful save. Higher-level spell slots are lost first. You regain expended spell slots of the same number and levels as what the target lost. This cannot cause you to stockpile spell slots beyond your normal allotment.
>
>***Metallic Breath Weapon (Recharges on long rest).*** You exhale a 15-foot cone of either Enervating Breath (Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated until the start of your next turn) or Repulsion Breath (Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked prone); save DC is {8 + npc.CONbonus() + npc.proficiencybonus()}.
>
>***Sorcerer Spellcasting (Cha, at level 20. Recharges on long rest).*** 6 cantrips known. 15 spells known. **Spell save DC: 19**, **Spell attack bonus: +11**

#### Description
***Ideals:*** *Aspiration/No limits/Redemption.*

***Motivation:*** *Changing the world.*

***Appearance:*** *Adult*, *Nervous eye twitch.*

***Talents:*** *Expert juggler.*

***Race: Dragonborn.*** Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

***Steel Dragonborn.***

***Class: Sorcerer.*** Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

***Sorcerous Origin: Arcane Legacy.*** You have inherited an aptitude for magic which you later learned to control. This usually means you are part of a long line of powerful mages, but it's also possible that your inborn talent is the first in your family.

***Feat: Shadow-Touched.*** You learn how to bend shadows from your experience with the Shadowfell.
