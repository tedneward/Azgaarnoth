>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

#### Description
***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: Dark Elf.*** Elvish scholars speak of an ancient schism amongst the Eldar--and some insist that this was the start of the Fall--that prompted an offshoot of the Eldar to take refuge underground. Rumors hold that these dark elves, the *drow*, are the reason (somehow) Mt Bezulb continues to erupt consistently. Note that despite numerous claims to the contrary, *drow* and *shadar-kai* are not the same race, and in fact they seem to have an inborn implacable hatred of one another that defies explanation.
