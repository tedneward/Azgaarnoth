>***Acting.*** You have an advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person. You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.
>
>***Alert.*** You can't be surprised while you are conscious. You gain a +5 bonus to initiative. Other creatures don't gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of your not being able to see them.
>
>***Bardic Inspiration (4 dice/Recharges on short or long rest).*** You can inspire others through stirring words or music.
>
>***Encipher.*** You can ably create written ciphers. Others can't decipher a code you create unless you teach them, they succeed on an Intelligence check (DC 20), or they use magic to decipher it.
>
>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Jack of All Trades.*** You can add 3 to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.
>
>***Magical Inspiration.*** If a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.
>
>***Magical Secrets.*** You have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Two of your known spells at 10th level, two more at 14th level, and two more at 18th level can be from any classes, including this one.
>
>***Piercer.*** Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack that deals piercing damage, you can reroll one of the attack's damage dice, and you must use the new roll. When you score a critical hit that deals piercing damage to a creature, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the extra piercing damage the target takes.
>
>***Shadow-Touched Spells.*** You can also cast your Shadow-Touched spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
>
>***Silver Tongue.*** You are a master at saying the right thing at the right time. When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
>
>***Song of Rest.*** If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.
>
>***Superior Inspiration.*** When you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>***Unfailing Inspiration.*** When a creature adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll fails, the creature can keep the Bardic Inspiration die.
>
>#### Actions
>***Countercharm.*** You can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).
>
>***Universal Speech (Recharges on long rest or spell slot of any level).*** Choose one or more creatures within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). The chosen creatures can magically understand you, regardless of the language you speak, for 1 hour.
>
>***Bard Spellcasting (Cha, at level 20. Recharges on long rest).*** 5 cantrips known. 23 spells prepared. **Spell save DC: 19**, **Spell attack bonus: +11**

>#### Reactions
>***Infectious Inspiration (4/Recharges on long rest).*** When a creature within 60 feet of you adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll succeeds, you can encourage a different creature (other than yourself) that can hear you within 60 feet of you, giving it a Bardic Inspiration die without expending any of your Bardic Inspiration uses.
>
>
>#### Bonus Actions
>***Bardic Inspiration: Inspiration.*** Choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die (d12).
>
>***Blessing of the Raven Queen .*** You can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. When you do, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.
>
>***Unsettling Words.*** You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The creature must subtract the number rolled from the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.

#### Description
***Ideals:*** *Aspiration/No limits/Slaughter.*

***Motivation:*** *Practicing and improving/perfecting a skill.*

***Appearance:*** *Middle-aged*, *Ragged, dirty clothes.*

***Talents:*** *Drinks everyone under the table.*

***Mannerisms:*** *Makes constant jokes or puns.*

***Interactions (with others):*** *Irritable*.

***Bond:*** *Dedicated to fulfilling a personal life goal.*

***Secret:*** *Has a secret magic item (possibly cursed).*

***Flaw:*** *Obese.*

***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: Shadow Elf.*** These elves, the *shadar-kai*, remain a mystery even to their kin--their origins are lost, their homes are undiscovered, and their motives and allegiances are absolutely indiscernible. Individual *shadar-kai* have been seen wandering the world, identifiable more by their piercings and tatoos than anything else, leaving many to wonder if other *shadar-kai*, unpierced and untattooed, also wander the world--and why. *Eladrin* and *shadar-kai* are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.

***Class: Bard.*** Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain.

***Bardic College: College of Eloquence.*** Adherents of the College of Eloquence master the art of oratory. Persuasion is regarded as a high art, and a well-reasoned, well-spoken argument often proves more powerful than objective truth. These bards wield a blend of logic and theatrical wordplay, winning over skeptics and detractors with logical arguments, and plucking at heartstrings to appeal to the emotions of entire audiences.

***Feat: Actor.*** You are skilled at mimicry and dramatics.

***Feat: Shadow-Touched.*** You learn how to bend shadows from your experience with the Shadowfell.

***Feat: Alert.*** You are always on the lookout for danger.

***Feat: Linguist.*** You have studied languages and codes.

***Feat: Piercer.*** You have achieved a penetrating precision in combat.
