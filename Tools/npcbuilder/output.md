>***Abyssal Focus.*** At the end of a long rest, you can channel and crystallize Abyssal energy to create an Abyssal focus that serves as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. The focus is destroyed if you create another one, or if you die. When the focus is destroyed, it causes Signs of Corruption in a 25-foot cube for 1 hour. It also deals radiant damage equal to your wizard level to anything within that cube.
>
>***Arcane Recovery.*** Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level of 5, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
>
>***Corrupted Empowerment (Recharges on long rest or one level of exhaustion).*** When you are affected by the [corrupted](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/conditions/Corrupted) condition, you embrace the darkness and draw strength from it. Upon becoming corrupted, you regain one expended spell slot. The level of the spell slot must be 3rd level or lower. For each level of exhaustion you have, the level of the spell slot you regain increases by one.
>
>***Corrupted Spellcasting.*** When you cast a spell, you can incorporate Abyssal energy into the spell, changing its nature temporarily in following ways: If the spell deals damage, all of the spell's damage type becomes radiant damage; The spell uses a Constitution saving throw with your spell save DC, instead of an attack roll or the spell's original saving throw; If this spell has area of effect, that effect now spreads around corners, even if the original spell's effect did not; A [corrupted](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/conditions/Corrupted) creature has disadvantage against this spell. As part of the spellcasting, you may also remove and expend an Abyssal Shard. When you use an Abyssal Shard with a spell, you can ignore material components up to 100 gp in value; a [corrupted](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/conditions/Corrupted) creature that fails its saving throw against this spell becomes blinded.
>
>***Keen Mind.*** You always know which way is north, the number of hours left before the next sunrise or sunset, and you can accurately recall anything you have seen or heard within the past month.
>
>***Signs of Corruption.*** When you draw upon your Abyssal connection, corruption is released around you. The area of a 25-foot cube, centered on you, is lightly obscured, and any healing done within it is halved. Any vegetation within the cube withers and dies. When a creature enters the zone for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 13) or become [corrupted](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/conditions/Corrupted) for 1 minute.

>***War Caster: Somaticism.*** You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.

>#### Actions
>***Abyssal Shard (Recharges on long rest or CON save/DC 7 + uses).*** While holding your Abyssal Focus, you can pluck a shard from it and throw it up to 30 feet, implanting it into the ground. At the end of your turn, the shard evaporates and causes Signs of Corruption on it for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or you make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 7 + the number of times you've used this feature with your current Abyssal Focus. You receive a bonus to this save equal to twice of your exhaustion level. On a failed save, Signs of Corruption immediately occurs centered on you instead and you become [corrupted](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/conditions/Corrupted) for 1 minute. If you fail the save by 5 or more, you also suffer one level of exhaustion.

It also has advantage on Constitution saving throws. **Flight.** The target gains a fly speed equal to half of its walking speed and the ability to hover in place. **Swimming.** The target gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed and the ability to breathe underwater.**Climbing.** The target gains a climb speed equal to its walking speed and can cling to walls and ceilings without making an ability check.

>***War Caster: Opportunity Cast.*** When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature. This does not count against your ability to cast a spell during your turn.

Copying a spell from your spellbook into another spellbook costs half this amount (in time and gold), since you know it already.

***Race: Gnoll.*** Gnolls are brutal hunters with a demonic ancestry who are fiercely loyal to their pack.

***Class: Wizard.*** Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more.

***Arcane Tradition: Corruption.*** Some wizards, driven by a particularly strong thirst for power, open portals to the most unholy, perverse, gruesome, and chaotic plane of existence: the Abyss. This chaotic power allows those who folow the Corruption Magic tradition to learn how to bend the darkest energies to their will. This magic is the most experimental and dangerous of all, and these mages are fearless pioneers of this new branch. Though, with great power comes great... side efects.
