#### Description
***Race: Human.*** Humans were the servant race of the Eldar and flourished and took over much of the lands after the Fall. It is not clear if humans were created by the Eldar, or were uplifted by them. Either way, humans owe their civilization to the initial one built by the Eldar, inheriting it after the Fall.

***Feat: Tough.*** You are harder to kill.

***Average human.*** Not much more to say here.

***Class: Monk.*** Monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

***Monastic Tradition: Way of Shadow.*** Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.
