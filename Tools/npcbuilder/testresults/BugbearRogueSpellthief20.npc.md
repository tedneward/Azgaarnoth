>***Elusive.*** No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.
>
>***Evasion.*** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
>
>***Long-Limbed.*** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.
>
>***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
>
>***Reliable Talent.*** Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
>
>***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, you can deal an extra 10d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
>
>***Spellthievery.*** You can learn and know Bard spells up to level 5, and you can steal 20 total spell levels per long rest.
>
>***Stroke of Luck (Recharges on short or long rest).*** If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
>
>***Surprise Attack.*** If you surprise a creature and hit it with an attack on your first turn in combat, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage to it. You can use this trait only once per combat.
>
>#### Actions
>***Spell Drain.*** You can steal a number of spell slots from a spellcaster equal to the maximum level spell you can cast and use those spell levels to cast a spell of your own. When you attempt to do this, the spellcaster must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 17). On a success, they block your attempt to steal their magical energy. On a failure, you steal their energy and can cast a spell with their spell slots. You must be within 30 feet of the spellcaster, and these stolen spell slots do not count against your total number you can steal per long rest. If you are hidden from a spellcaster, you can use your Spell Drain ability without the target getting the chance to make a saving throw.

>#### Reactions
>***Steal Spell.*** In order to cast a spell you know, you must steal the magical energy from a spellcaster who is actively casting a spell of their own. In order to steal the magical energy from a spellcaster, you must be able to see the spellcaster and they must be within 30 feet of you. Once you have stolen the magical energy from another spellcaster, you immediately channel that energy into a spell of your own. You can cast any spell you know, and you will cast it at the level corresponding to the level of the spell you just stole. If that spell has a casting time of 1 action or longer, you must cast it on your next action, or the energy dissipates harmlessly. If you attempt to steal a spell that is higher level than what you are able to steal, or if stealing the spell would exceed your maximum spell levels per long rest, the attempt will automatically fail and you cannot steal spells again until you finish a long rest.
>
>***Uncanny Dodge.*** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can halve the attack's damage against you.
>
>
>#### Bonus Actions
>***Cunning Action.*** You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. You may also your Cunning Action to carefully aim your next attack. As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

***Race: Bugbear.*** Bugbears were the lazy bullies of the Hordes, and the rest of Azgaarnoth is grateful that these physical specimens of might have generally chosen the easiest path rather than seek to assert themselves collectively as a race. As the only members of the Hordes that might have challenged the minotaurs for primacy over the Hordes, bugbears effectively ceded primacy over the Hordes to the bull-men by choosing instead to focus on rest and sleep and lethargy.

***Class: Rogue.*** Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

***Roguish Archetype: Spellthief.*** These rogues focus their skills and training on recognizing magical spells and stealing them from the caster. They then refocus that magical energy to power their own spells.
