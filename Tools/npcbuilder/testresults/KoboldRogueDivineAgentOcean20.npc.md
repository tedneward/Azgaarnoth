>___
>***Divine Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack you can cause the attack to deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target.
>
>***Elusive.*** No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.
>
>***Evasion.*** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
>
>***Lucky (3/Recharges on long rest).*** Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20 and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.
>
>***Reliable Talent.*** Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
>
>***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, you can deal an extra 10d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
>
>***Stroke of Luck (Recharges on short or long rest).*** If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
>
>***Vessel of the Many Forms.*** You can cast [alter self](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/alter-self/) at will, without expending a spell slot. For you, this spell does not require concentration and lasts until it is dispelled.

#### Description
Ideals: Freedom/Balance/Slaughter

Appearance: Missing fingers

Talents: Great at one game

Mannerisms: Overly dramatic, as if on stage, when excited

Interactions with others: Hot-tempered with others

Bond: Protective of a valuable possession

Flaw: Foolhardy bravery

***Race: Kobold.*** 

***Class: Rogue.*** Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

***Roguish Archetype: Divine Agent.*** In secrecy and shadows, divine agents work to further the agendas of the gods. Although divine agents dedicate their service to a deity in a similar way to clerics, they are generally above many of the normal rules and conventions of the church. Usually, they answer only to their deity and use divine magic and blessings to augment their roguish skills.

***Feat: Lucky.*** You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment.
