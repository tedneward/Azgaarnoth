>***Beast Shapes.*** You can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.
>
>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Land's Stride.*** Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the Entangle spell.
>
>***Natural Recovery (Recharges on long rest).*** During a short rest, you can recover up to 10 total spell slots of less than 6th level.
>
>***Timeless Body.*** The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>#### Actions
>***Wild Companion.*** You can expend a use of your Wild Shape to cast [find familiar](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/find-familiar/), without material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after 10 hours.
>
>***Wild Shape.*** You can magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1 or lower. You can stay in a beast shape for 10 hours. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: Wild Elf.*** The *grugach* are those elves that sought to escape the world into the wilds. *Grugach* look almost identical to any other elves, and so will generally not raise an eyebrow when seen on the street or on board a ship. Other elves will note the subtle differences that mark the *grugach*, however, particularly after some close contact.

***Class: Druid.*** Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature, but see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.

***Druidic Circle: Circle of the Land.*** The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's ways.

***Feat: Animal Handler.*** You master the techniques needed to train and handle animals.
