>***Elemental Touched.*** When you finish a long rest, you can choose which element you are attuned to: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. Depending on your choice, you can use the appropriate bonus action listed.
>
>***Evasion.*** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
>
>***Ki (20/Recharges on short or long rest).*** Ki save DC 17.
>
>***Ki: Diamond Soul.*** Whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.
>
>***Ki: Focused Aim.*** When you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase your attack roll by 2 for each of these ki points you spend, potentially turning the miss into a hit.
>
>***Ki: Fueling Elemental Disciplines.*** You can spend up to the (total) maximum of 6 ki points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend.
>
>***Ki: Stunning Strike.*** When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (against your Ki save DC) or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
>
>***Martial Arts.*** When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.
>
>***Perfect Self.*** When you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.
>
>***Psi-Boosted Ability.*** When you make a DEX ability check, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check. You can choose to do so before or after rolling the d20, but before you know whether the check succeeded or failed.
>
>***Psi-Guided Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll that uses DEX, you can roll your Psionic Talent die after you make the damage roll and then replace one of the damage dice with the number rolled on the Psionic Talent die.
>
>***Psionic Talent (Recharges on long rest).*** You also harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of which is a d12. If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll, and if the die size is d4 when it decreases, your Psionic Talent becomes unusuable until after a long rest. Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size.
>

Your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 10 feet for that action, as well as the rest of the turn. A hit with such an attack deals fire damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and if you spend 1 ki point when the attack hits, it also deals an extra 1d10 fire damage.

>#### Reactions
>***Deflect Missiles.*** When you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, you deflect or catch the missile, reducing the damage you take from the attack by 1d10 + 22.

#### Description
Ideals: Nation/Redemption/Change

Appearance: Distinctive jewelry: earrings, necklace, circlet, bracelets

Talents: Great with animals

Mannerisms: Speaks in unusually formal manner

Interactions with others: Honest with others

Bond: Captivated by a romantic interest

Flaw: Hiding from powerful forces

***Race: Human.*** Humans were the servant race of the Eldar and flourished and took over much of the lands after the Fall. It is not clear if humans were created by the Eldar, or were uplifted by them. Either way, humans owe their civilization to the initial one built by the Eldar, inheriting it after the Fall.

***Feat: Tough.*** You are harder to kill.



***Class: Monk.*** Monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

***Monastic Tradition: Way of the Four Elements.*** You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.

***Feat: Elemental Touched.*** You've been exposed to the primordial magic of the Elemental Planes, granting you a measure of control over the natural world around you.

***Feat: Wild Talent.*** You awaken to your psionic potential, which enhances your mind or body.
