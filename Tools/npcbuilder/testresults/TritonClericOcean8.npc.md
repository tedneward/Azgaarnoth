>#### Actions
>***Channel Divinity: Torrential Wrath.*** A forceful 10-foot-high wave of cold water erupts in a 30ft-radius circle around you. All creatures within the circle must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 4d6 cold and 4d6 bludgeoning damage and be pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone. Creatures take half as much damage and are not pushed and knocked down on a successful saving throw. Creatures of the Huge size and larger are not pushed back and knocked prone. You must not be in the air when you do this.
>
>***Channel Divinity: Turn Undead.***  You can use one of your uses of Channel Divinity to turn undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, if it is a CR of 1 or lower it is destroyed; otherwise it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

***Race: Triton.*** Tritons guard the ocean depths, building small settlements beside deep trenches, portals to the elemental planes, and other dangerous spots far from the eyes of land-bound folk. Long-established guardians of the deep ocean floor, the noble tritons have gradually become increasingly active in the world above.

***Class: Cleric.*** Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.

***Divine Domain: Ocean.*** Clerics of Gods who control the waves and tides, as well as the beasts who dwell within the depths of the sea draw power from this domain.
