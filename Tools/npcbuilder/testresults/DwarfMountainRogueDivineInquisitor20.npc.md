>***Dwarven Resilience.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison.
>
>***Elusive.*** No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.
>
>***Evasion.*** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
>
>***Greater Judgment.*** Your Judgment grows stronger and you ignore any damage resistances the target of your judgment might have, and treat any of its damage immunities as damage resistances instead. This ability does not overlap with itself. Also, you can now use your Judgment even if you don't have a line of sight to your target, as long as you know the target's location. In addition, if your target is invisible or shapechanged when you use the Judgment, it must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 19) at the start of each of its turns. On a failure either effect is suppressed until the Judgment ends, and the target cannot turn invisible or change shape for the duration.
>
>***Occult Lore.*** You have advantage on Insight and Investigation checks to reveal the deception and disguises of fey, fiends, shapechangers, and undead, as well as heretics (subject to DM discretion).
>
>***Reliable Talent.*** Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
>
>***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, you can deal an extra 10d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
>
>***Stonecunning.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, it is considered proficient in the History skill and add doubles its proficiency bonus to the check.
>
>***Stroke of Luck (Recharges on short or long rest).*** If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
>
>#### Actions
>***Final Judgment (Recharges on long rest).*** You pray to your deity for a final judgment. This ends the Judgment on your target, but it must succeed on a Charisma Saving Throw against DC 19. On a failed save, the target takes radiant damage equal to double your sneak attack damage. On a successful save the target takes only half damage.

>#### Bonus Actions
>***Channel Divinity: Judgment.*** You present your holy symbol and pronounce judgment upon your foes. One target of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you becomes the target of your Judgment, and is branded with a faintly glowing sign reminiscent to your deity's holy symbol. For 1 minute, against the target of your Judgment, you don't need advantage on your attack roll or an enemy of the target within 5 feet of it to use your Sneak Attack. The extra damage from your Sneak Attack against the target of your Judgment is radiant damage. All the other rules for the Sneak Attack class feature still apply to you.
>
>***Cunning Action.*** You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. You may also your Cunning Action to carefully aim your next attack. As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

***Race: Dwarf.*** Dwarves are hardy folk, often usually working in skilled professions. Some have taken up more agrarian roots, choosing to embrace the world of sun and rain, but many dwarves find themselves naturally drawn to lives of practiced skills. Take careful note, though: despite their history, dwarves are just as fond of scroll and pen as they are crossbow and axe. Traditions hold among the dwarven clans, one of those being martial exercise, so most dwarves are trained in some form of weaponry, and likely to fight if antagonized.

***Subrace: Mountain Dwarf.*** The hill and mountain dwarves are essentially small genetic differences within the dwarven bloodline, but at this point in Azgaarnoth's history they are essentially meaningless as cultural differentiators--hill dwarves often work in the hills as part of their guild/clan, and mountain dwarves are often found in mountains for similar reasons. In fact, it's more common to see them in cities than in hills or mountains. Most non-dwarves can't even tell the difference between them.

***Class: Rogue.*** Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

***Roguish Archetype: Divine Inquisitor.*** Grim and determined, the inquisitor roots out enemies of the faith and faithful â”€ both mundane and supernatural, using trickery and guile when righteousness and purity is not enough. Although inquisitors are dedicated to a deity, they are above many of the normal rules and conventions of the church. They answer to their deity and their own sense of justice alone, and are willing to take extreme measures to meet their goals.
