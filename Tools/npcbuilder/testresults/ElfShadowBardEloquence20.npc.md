>***Acting.*** You have an advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person. You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.
>
>***Alchemical Improvement.*** Over the course of any short rest, you can temporarily improve the potency of one potion of healing of any rarity. To use this benefit, you must have alchemist's supplies with you, and the potion must be within reach. If the potion is drunk no more than 1 hour after the short rest ends, the creature drinking the potion can forgo the potion's die roll and regains the maximum number of hit points that the potion can restore.
>
>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Jack of All Trades.*** You can add 3 to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.
>
>***Lucky (3/Recharges on long rest).*** Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20 and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.
>
>***Magical Inspiration.*** If a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.
>
>***Magical Secrets.*** You have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Two of your known spells at 10th level, two more at 14th level, and two more at 18th level can be from any classes, including this one.
>
>***Piercer.*** Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack that deals piercing damage, you can reroll one of the attack's damage dice, and you must use the new roll. When you score a critical hit that deals piercing damage to a creature, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the extra piercing damage the target takes.
>
>***Shadow-Touched Spells.*** You can also cast your Shadow-Touched spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
>
>***Silver Tongue.*** You are a master at saying the right thing at the right time. When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
>
>***Song of Rest.*** You can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.
>
>***Superior Inspiration.*** When you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>***Unfailing Inspiration.*** When a creature adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll fails, the creature can keep the Bardic Inspiration die.
>
>#### Actions
>***Alchemical Identification.*** You can identify one potion within 5 feet of you, as if you had tasted it. You must see the liquid for this benefit to work.
>
>***Countercharm.*** You can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).
>
>***Universal Speech (Recharges on long rest or spell slot of any level).*** Choose one or more creatures within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). The chosen creatures can magically understand you, regardless of the language you speak, for 1 hour.
>
>***Bard Spellcasting (Cha, at level 20. Recharges on long rest).*** 5 cantrips known. 22 spells prepared. Spell save DC: 16, Spell attack bonus: +8

>#### Reactions
>***Infectious Inspiration (1/Recharges on long rest).*** When a creature within 60 feet of you adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll succeeds, you can encourage a different creature (other than yourself) that can hear you within 60 feet of you, giving it a Bardic Inspiration die without expending any of your Bardic Inspiration uses.
>
>
>#### Bonus Actions
>***Bardic Inspiration (1/Recharges on long rest).*** You can inspire others through stirring words or music. Choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d12.
>
>***Blessing of the Raven Queen You can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. When you do, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.
>
>***Unsettling Words.*** You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The creature must subtract the number rolled from the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.

#### Description
Ideals: Moderation/Tradition/Glory

Appearance: Bald

Talents: Skilled dancer

Mannerisms: Uses flowery speech or long words

Interactions with others: Humble with others

Bond: Loyal to a benefactor, patron, or employer

Flaw: Overpowering greed

***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: Shadow Elf.*** These elves, the *shadar-kai*, remain a mystery even to their kin--their origins are lost, their homes are undiscovered, and their motives and allegiances are absolutely indiscernible. Individual *shadar-kai* have been seen wandering the world, identifiable more by their piercings and tatoos than anything else, leaving many to wonder if other *shadar-kai*, unpierced and untattooed, also wander the world--and why. *Eladrin* and *shadar-kai* are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.

***Class: Bard.*** Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain.

***Bardic College: College of Eloquence.*** Adherents of the College of Eloquence master the art of oratory. Persuasion is regarded as a high art, and a well-reasoned, well-spoken argument often proves more powerful than objective truth. These bards wield a blend of logic and theatrical wordplay, winning over skeptics and detractors with logical arguments, and plucking at heartstrings to appeal to the emotions of entire audiences.

***Feat: Actor.*** You are skilled at mimicry and dramatics.

***Feat: Shadow-Touched.*** You learn how to bend shadows from your experience with the Shadowfell.

***Feat: Lucky.*** You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment.

***Feat: Alchemist.*** You have studied the secrets of alchemy and are an expert in its practice.

***Feat: Piercer.*** You have achieved a penetrating precision in combat.
