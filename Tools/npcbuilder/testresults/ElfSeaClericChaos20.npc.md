>***Amphibious.*** You can breathe air and water.
>
>***Channel Divinity (3/Recharges on short or long rest).*** See below for the details of each use.
>
>***Chaos Control (Recharges on long rest).*** When you use a Channel Divinity feature, you can cause one spell of 3rd-level or lower that is affecting you or a willing creature that you can see within 30 feet of you to stop affecting that creature and instead start affecting a different willing creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet.
>
>***Chef: Long rest.*** With one hour of work or when you finish a long rest, you can cook 7 treats. These special treats last 8 hours after being made. Any creature eating one of those treats (using a bonus action) gains 7 temporary hit points.
>
>***Chef: Short rest.*** You can cook special food, provided you have ingredients and cook's utensils on hand. You can prepare enough of this food for 11 creatures. At the end of the short rest, any creature who eats the food and spends one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points regains an extra 1d8 hit points.
>
>***Destined.*** Choose two backgrounds that are different than the one you started with. You gain those backgrounds' features in addition to your original background feature. This does not grant you additional proficiencies or equipment.
>
>***Destiny Points (Recharges on long rest).*** You have 3 destiny points. When you make an ability check and see the total but before you know the result of the check, you can spend 1 Destiny Point to change the number you rolled on the d20 to 15. You cannot use this to alter a check that affects a spell, a check that affects a grapple, or a Concentration check.
>
>***Divine Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 2d8 damage to the target. The type of damage depends on the number rolled; choose which d8 to use to determine the damage type. If both d8s roll the same result, you instead choose a type: **1** acid **2** cold **3** fire **4** lightning **5** necrotic **6** poison **7** radiant **8** thunder.
>
>***Emissary of the Sea.*** You can communicate simple ideas with beasts that can breathe water. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return.
>
>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Healer.*** When you use a healer's kit to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains 1 hit point.
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>#### Actions
>***Channel Divinity: Turn Undead.***  You can use one of your uses of Channel Divinity to turn undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, if it is a CR of 4 or lower it is destroyed; otherwise it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
>
>***Channel Divinity: Wild Blessing.*** You present your holy symbol and choose an effect from the following:: **1:** You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of either your starting position or your new position must make a Constitution saving throw, taking thunder damage equal to 2d6 + 20 on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Nonmagical objects of your choice in the area that aren't being worn or carried also take full damage. **2:** Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you is surrounded by a barrier that grants it a +2 bonus to AC until the end of your next turn and advantage on the next saving throw it makes during that time. **3:** A wave of flames bursts outward in a 15-foot radius sphere centered on a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 + 20 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. **4:** Negative energy swirls as dark mist around you, lightly obscuring the area within 30 feet of you until the end of your next turn. Each creature of your choice within the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 17) or be poisoned until the end of your next turn. If you target at least one creature with this effect, you and each creature of your choice in the area also gain 20 temporary hit points. **5:** A wave of positive energy fills the area within 30 feet of you with bright light until the end of your next turn. Up to four creatures of your choice within the area each regain 20 hit points. If a creature has more than 0 hit points when it receives this healing, it also gains 10 temporary hit points. **6:** A bolt of lightning surges toward one creature or object that you can see within 60 feet of you. You may also choose up to two other creatures or objects within 15 feet of the first target. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 17). On a failed saving throw, a target takes lightning damage equal to 2d6 + 20, and until the end of its next turn, it can't take reactions and it has disadvantage on attack rolls. On a successful saving throw, a target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. **7:** Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 17) or else it must use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against one creature of your choice within its reach, dealing 20 extra damage. **8:** Up to three creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 17). On a failed saving throw, a creature is transformed into a Small object chosen by the DM (such as a chair or a potted plant) until the end of its next turn. While transformed, it is stunned and it can't speak. If it takes damage, the transformation ends immediately. **9:** One willing creature that you can see within 60 feet of you regains 1d6 + 40 hit points. Also, you can teleport the target up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see within 60 feet of you, and until the end of its next turn, it has advantage on saving throws and enemies have disadvantage on attacks against it. **10:** One creature that you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it takes 3d6 + 40 cold damage and its speed is reduced to 0 feet until the end of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, it takes half as much damage and its speed isn't reduced.
>
>***Divine Intervention (Recharges on long rest/seven days).*** Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than {npc.levels('Cleric')}, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
>
>***Healer.*** You can spend one use of a healer's kit to tend to a creature and restore 1d6 + 4 hit points to it, plus additional hit points equal to the creature's maximum number of Hit Dice. The creature can't regain hit points from this feat again until it finishes a short or long rest.
>
>***Uncanny Insight.*** You can try to get uncanny insight about one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on attack rolls and ability checks against the target until the end of your next turn.

#### Description
Ideals: Slaughter/Moderation/Redemption

Appearance: Bald

Talents: Expert cook

Mannerisms: Taps fingers

Interactions with others: Honest with others

Bond: Protective of close family members

Flaw: Convinced of their own immortality

***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: Sea Elf.*** *Maerach* look strikingly similar to elves, aside from a small set of gills set just below their ears, which long hair (worn loosely) can usually hide.

***Class: Cleric.*** Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.

***Divine Domain: Chaos.*** Clerics of the Chaos Domain often aspire to be just as unpredictable as their deity. They work to abolish every status quo and upset every unquestioned norm.

***Feat: Destined.*** You are part of a tapestry of purpose beyond your reckoning, and you are destined for great things, not to be stymied by the whims of luck or karma. You know that you will leave a mark on the story that unfolds around you, and perhaps even on the world.

***Feat: Healer.*** You are an able physician, allowing you to mend wounds quickly and get your allies back in the fight.

***Feat: Chef.*** Time and effort spent mastering the culinary arts has paid off.

***Feat: Animal Handler.*** You master the techniques needed to train and handle animals.

***Feat: Empathic.*** You possess keen insight into how other people think and feel.
