>***Aberrant Dragonmark Flaw.*** The skin around your mark has an unusual appearance: burned, scaly, withered, etc.
>
>***Aberrant Mark Metamagic.*** When you cast a spell with your aberrant mark, you can use one of your Hit Die to increase the spell's level by 1. Immediately after you cast the spell, roll the Hit Die. You take damage equal to the number rolled.
>
>***Brightfolk.*** You have advantage on saving throws to resist being blinded by effects that deal radiant damage or create light.
>
>***Divine Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack you can cause the attack to deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target.
>
>***Elusive.*** No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.
>
>***Encipher.*** You can ably create written ciphers. Others can't decipher a code you create unless you teach them, they succeed on an Intelligence check (DC {npc.INT + npc.proficiencybonus()}), or they use magic to decipher it.
>
>***Evasion.*** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
>
>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Keen Mind.*** You always know which way is north, the number of hours left before the next sunrise or sunset, and you can accurately recall anything you have seen or heard within the past month.
>
>***Lucky (3/Recharges on long rest).*** Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20 and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.
>
>***Reliable Talent.*** Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
>
>***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, you can deal an extra 10d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
>
>***Stroke of Luck (Recharges on short or long rest).*** If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>***Vessel of the Many Forms.*** You can cast [alter self](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/alter-self/) at will, without expending a spell slot. For you, this spell does not require concentration and lasts until it is dispelled.
>
>#### Actions
>***Help.*** When you aid another creature's ability check, you can make a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. On success, the creature's check gains a +{npc.proficiencybonus()} bonus as you share pertinent advice and historical examples, but to receive this bonus, the creature must be able to understand what you're saying.

#### Description
Ideals: Responsibility/Greed/Greed

Appearance: Distinctive posture (crooked or rigid)

Talents: Great at solving puzzles

Mannerisms: Speaks in rhyme or some other noticeable habit

***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: Bright Elf.*** As a bright elf, your body and soul are infused with light. A bright elf's skin is bronze, silvery, pearly, or pale white, and their hair is golden blond, platinum blond, or silvery white. Their eyes are usually golden or silvery gray, with streaks of white radiating from their pupils like a starburst.

***Class: Rogue.*** Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

***Roguish Archetype: Divine Agent.*** In secrecy and shadows, divine agents work to further the agendas of the gods. Although divine agents dedicate their service to a deity in a similar way to clerics, they are generally above many of the normal rules and conventions of the church. Usually, they answer only to their deity and use divine magic and blessings to augment their roguish skills.

***Feat: Linguist.*** You have studied languages and codes.

***Feat: Keen Mind.*** You have a mind that can track time, direction, and detail with uncanny precision.

***Feat: Lucky.*** You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment.

***Feat: Investigator.*** You have an eye for detail and can pick out the smallest clues.

***Feat: Historian.*** Your study of history rewards you with benefits.

***Feat: Aberrant Dragonmark.*** Aberrant dragonmarks are marks that are unpredictable and dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Someone with such a mark can kill with a touch or control minds with a glance. Aberrant marks always have flaws. These may not actively hurt a character, but they are always a burden in some way--a burden that could drive a weak-willed person to madness.
