>***Duelist's Challenge (Recharges on short rest).*** You may issue a challenge against a single target within 30 feet that you can see. That target must make a Charisma save (DC = 11) or be forced to engage you in combat.

***Race: Sahuagin.***

***Race: Sahuagin.*** A fish-like monstrous humanoid species that lives in oceans, seas, underground lakes, and underwater caves.

***Class: Fighter.*** Fighters share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. They are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

***Martial Archetype: Duelist.*** The duelist lives for the thrill of combat, but most of all, they thrive in seeking out and challenging the most skilled foe on any battlefield. Once a duelist engages with their latest nemesis, everything else fades into oblivion, forgotten in the moment. The dance of the duel offers them the best way to learn new tricks, hone combat skills, and—most importantly--solidify their reputation as the superior swordsman.
