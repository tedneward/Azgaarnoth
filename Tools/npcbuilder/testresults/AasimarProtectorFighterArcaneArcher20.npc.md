>___
>***Action Surge (2/Recharges on short or long rest).*** On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.
>
>***Arcane Shot (4/Recharges on short or long rest).*** Once per turn when you fire a magic arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits, unless the option doesn't involve an attack roll.
>
>***Ever-Ready Shot.*** If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.
>
>***Fighting Style: Archery.*** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
>
>***Indomitable (3/Recharges on long rest).*** You can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
>
>***Magic Arrow.*** Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it a magic arrow, with a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.
>
>***Sharpshooter.*** Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls. Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover. Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If that attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.
>
>#### Actions
>***Banishing Arrow.*** If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes the usual damage, plus 2d6 force damage, and must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 15) or be banished. While banished in this way, its speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
>
>***Bursting Arrow.*** If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes the usual damage, and it and each creature within 10 feet of it takes 4d6 force damage each.
>
>***Healing Hands (Recharges after long rest).*** You can touch a creature and cause it to regain 20 hit points.
>
>***Mind-Scrambling Arrow.*** Choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra 4d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) or it can't attack the chosen ally or include that ally in a harmful area of effect until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally deals any damage to the target.
>
>***Multiattack.*** You can attack four times whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
>
>***Radiant Soul (Recharges after long rest).*** The aasimar can unleash the divine energy within itself, causing its eyes to glimmer and two luminous, incorporeal wings to sprout from its back. This transformation lasts for 1 minute or until the aasimar ends it as a bonus action. During it, the aasimar has a flying speed of 30 feet, and once on each of its turns, you can deal extra 20 radiant damage to one target when it deals damage to it with an attack or a spell.
>
>***Seeking Arrow.*** Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 2d6 force damage, and you learn the target's current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don't learn its location.
>
>***Shadow Arrow.*** If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes the usual damage, plus 4d6 psychic damage, and must also succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.
>
>***Aasimar Spellcasting (Cha. Recharges on long rest).*** Spell save DC: 16, Spell attack bonus: +8

Among elves, Arcane Archers are some of their most elite warriors. These archers stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.
