>***Beast Shapes.*** You can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.
>
>***Enhanced Cold.*** Whenever you cast a spell that deals cold damage or restores hit points, roll a d8. You can add this number to the damage or healing roll of the spell.
>
>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Timeless Body.*** The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>#### Actions
>***Chill of Revival (Recharges on long rest).*** If you are at 0 hit points and unconscious, you regain half your hit points and immediately rise to your feet.
>
>***Wild Companion.*** You can expend a use of your Wild Shape to cast [find familiar](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/find-familiar/), without material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after 10 hours.
>
>***Wild Shape.*** You can magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1 or lower. You can stay in a beast shape for 10 hours. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

The healing or damage equals 2d10 + 3.

***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: Wild Elf.*** The *grugach* are those elves that sought to escape the world into the wilds. *Grugach* look almost identical to any other elves, and so will generally not raise an eyebrow when seen on the street or on board a ship. Other elves will note the subtle differences that mark the *grugach*, however, particularly after some close contact.

***Class: Druid.*** Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature, but see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.

***Druidic Circle: Circle of Frost.*** Druids within the Circle of Frost understand that winter is not just a period of time during the season--it is the fate to which we all head. The coldness of space, the void, death, it is all the same frost, and druids of frost seek to bring all of creation back to its original--frosty--state.

***Feat: Animal Handler.*** You master the techniques needed to train and handle animals.
