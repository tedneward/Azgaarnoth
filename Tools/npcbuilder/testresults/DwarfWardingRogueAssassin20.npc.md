>***Aberrant Dragonmark Flaw.*** You have dramatic mood swings any time you use your mark.
>
>***Aberrant Mark Metamagic.*** When you cast a spell with your aberrant mark, you can use one of your Hit Die to increase the spell's level by 1. Immediately after you cast the spell, roll the Hit Die. You take damage equal to the number rolled.
>
>***Always Audacious.*** You add your Charisma modifier to your initiative rolls.
>
>***Dwarven Resilience.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison.
>
>***Elusive.*** No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.
>
>***Evasion.*** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
>
>***Fancy Footwork.*** During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature cannot make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.
>
>***Intuition Dice.*** A dragonmark improves your ability to perform a specific type of task. Each dragonmark has a trait that allows you to roll an Intuition die, a d4, when you perform an ability check with a particular skill or tool. You add the number rolled to the ability check. You don’t have to be proficient with the skill or tool to gain this benefit. Feats, magic items, and other features may improve your Intuition die. This increases the type of die you roll by one size (d6, d8, d10) to a maximum of a d10. You can only roll one Intuition die for a check; if you receive Intuition dice from multiple sources, increase one die by one type and roll that one. For example, if a dragonmarked trait and feat both grant intuition with Dexterity (Stealth) checks, you roll a d6, instead of a d4. Three instances would increase your Intuition Die to a d8, and so on.
>
>***Master of Locks.*** When you make an Intelligence (History), Intelligence (Investigation), or Thieves' Tools check involving lock and trap mechanisms, you can roll one Intuition die, a d4, and add the number rolled to the ability check.
>
>***Reliable Talent.*** Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
>
>***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, you can deal an extra 10d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
>
>***Stonecunning.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, it is considered proficient in the History skill and add doubles its proficiency bonus to the check.
>
>***Stroke of Luck (Recharges on short or long rest).*** If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
>
>#### Actions
>***Master Duelist (Recharges on short or long rest).*** If you miss with an attack, you can choose to roll the attack again with advantage.
>
>***Panache.*** You can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language. If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile, it must target you with any attacks it makes and cannot willingly move farther away from you. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you move more than 60 feet away from the target. If you succeed on the check and the creature is not hostile, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance.

***Race: Dwarf.*** Dwarves are hardy folk, often usually working in skilled professions. Some have taken up more agrarian roots, choosing to embrace the world of sun and rain, but many dwarves find themselves naturally drawn to lives of practiced skills. Take careful note, though: despite their history, dwarves are just as fond of scroll and pen as they are crossbow and axe. Traditions hold among the dwarven clans, one of those being martial exercise, so most dwarves are trained in some form of weaponry, and likely to fight if antagonized.

***Dragonmark: Mark of Warding.*** A dragonmark is a distinctive symbol that appears on the skin. Dragonmarks are painted in vivid shades of blue and purple and seem to shimmer or even move slightly. When used, they grow warm to the touch. A dragonmark can’t be removed--even if a limb bearing a dragonmark is cut away, the mark eventually manifests on another part of the bearer’s body. The Mark of Warding helps its bearers protect things of value. Using the mark, a dwarf can weave wards and seal portals with mystic force. It also provides its bearer with an intuitive understanding of locks and mechanisms used to protect and seal. The decision each heir has to make is whether they’ll use this power to keep things safe, or whether they’re more interested in opening locks and taking what’s inside.

***Dragonmark Quirk.*** Your dragonmark itches when you’re near someone with a dragonmark.

***Class: Rogue.*** Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

***Roguish Archetype: Swashbuckler.*** You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying on speed, elegance, and charisma in equal parts. While other warriors are  brutes clad in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks more like performance. A swashbuckler excels in single combat, and can fight with two weapons while safely darting away from an opponent. Swashbucklers are especially talented at making difficult maneuvers to escape enemies or attack from an unexpected direction.

***Feat: Aberrant Dragonmark.*** Aberrant dragonmarks are marks that are unpredictable and dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Someone with such a mark can kill with a touch or control minds with a glance. Aberrant marks always have flaws. These may not actively hurt a character, but they are always a burden in some way--a burden that could drive a weak-willed person to madness.
