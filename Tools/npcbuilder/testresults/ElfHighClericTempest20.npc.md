>***Channel Divinity (3/Recharges on short or long rest).*** See below for the details of each use.
>
>***Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath.*** When you roll lightning or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.
>
>***Divine Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 2d8 thunder damage to the target.
>
>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

>***Stormborn.*** You can only fly whenever you are not underground or indoors; you must have a clear view of the sky..
>
>***Thunderous Strike.*** When you deal lightning damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can also push it up to 10 feet away from you.
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>#### Actions
>***Channel Divinity: Turn Undead.***  You can use one of your uses of Channel Divinity to turn undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, if it is a CR of 4 or lower it is destroyed; otherwise it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
>
>***Divine Intervention (Recharges on long rest/seven days).*** Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than {npc.levels('Cleric')}, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

#### Description
Ideals: Logic/Domination/Community

Appearance: Pronounced scar on face

Talents: Incredibly unlucky

Mannerisms: Paces while speaking

Interactions with others: Hot-tempered with others

Bond: Protective of a valuable possession

Flaw: Secret crime or misdeed

***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: High Elf.*** High elves and wood elves are, by this point in Azgaarnoth's history, fairly well intermixed and are found in most locations all across Azgaarnoth; at this point in their evolution, no non-elf can tell the difference between them.

***Class: Cleric.*** Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.

***Divine Domain: Tempest.*** Clerics of the Tempest domain find power and beauty in the wracking storms that batter coastlines and bring the seas to rage. They are often themselves of a fierce temper, some ready to embrace that temper at the first moment, others requiring longer provocation, but once provoked, their wrath knows no limits.
