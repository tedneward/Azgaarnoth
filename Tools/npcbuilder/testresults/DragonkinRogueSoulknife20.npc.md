>***Elusive.*** No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.
>
>***Evasion.*** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
>
>***Flight.*** You can't be wearing medium or heavy armor while flying.
>
>***Homing Strikes.*** If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blades and miss the target, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size, regardless of the number rolled.
>
>***Powerful Build.*** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
>
>***Psi-Bolstered Knack.*** When your non-psionic training fails you, you can tap into your psionic power to help: if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success.
>
>***Psionic Talent (Recharges on long rest).*** Your Psionic Talent die starts as a d12. If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size.
>
>***Psychic Whispers.*** You can use your psychic abilities to establish telepathic communication between yourself and others--perfect for quiet infiltration. As an action, you give yourself and at least one other creature the ability to speak telepathically with each other. When you do so, roll your Psionic Talent die, and choose creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to the number rolled. For 1 hour, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can't use this telepathy if it can't speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don't need to speak a common language to understand each other.
>
>***Reliable Talent.*** Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
>
>***Rend Mind (Recharges on long rest or decreased Psionic Talent die).*** When you use your Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18). Unless the save succeeds, the target is stunned until the end of your next turn.
>
>***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, you can deal an extra 10d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
>
>***Stroke of Luck (Recharges on short or long rest).*** If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
>
>#### Actions
>***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d4 + 1 piercing damage.
>
>***Psionic Veil (Recharges on long rest or decreased Psionic Talent die).*** You can magically become invisible, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, for 10 minutes or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility ends if you deal damage to a creature or if you force a creature to make a saving throw.
>
>***Psychic Blade (Thrown).*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, Range 20/60, one target. Hit: 1d6 + 3 psychic damage. The blade vanishes immediately after it hits or misses its target, and it leaves no mark on its target if it deals damage. After you attack with the blade, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second psychic blade as a bonus action on the same turn, provided your other hand is free to create it.

As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

>***Psychic Teleportation.*** If your Psionic Talent die is available, you can hurl your Psychic Blades to magically transport yourself to another location by manifesting one of your Psychic Blades and throwing it at an unoccupied space you can see, up to a number of feet away equal to 5 times the highest number on your Psionic Talent die. You then teleport to that space, the blade vanishes, and your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size.

Most dragonkin originated out of the lands of the Hordes, though now dragonkin can be found all over Azgaarnoth, albeit rarely.

***Class: Rogue.*** Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

***Roguish Archetype: Soulknife.*** Most assassins strike with physical weapons, and many burglars and spies use thieves' tools to infiltrate secure locations, whereas a Soulknife strikes and infiltrates with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work.
