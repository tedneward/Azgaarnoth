***Race: Bugbear.*** Bugbears were the lazy bullies of the Hordes, and the rest of Azgaarnoth is grateful that these physical specimens of might have generally chosen the easiest path rather than seek to assert themselves collectively as a race. As the only members of the Hordes that might have challenged the minotaurs for primacy over the Hordes, bugbears effectively ceded primacy over the Hordes to the bull-men by choosing instead to focus on rest and sleep and lethargy.

***Class: Monk.*** Monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

***Monastic Tradition: Way of the Long Death.*** Monks of the Way of the Long Death are obsessed with the meaning and mechanics of dying. They capture creatures and prepare elaborate experiments to capture, record, and understand the moments of their demise. They then use this knowledge to guide their understanding of martial arts, yielding a deadly fighting style.
