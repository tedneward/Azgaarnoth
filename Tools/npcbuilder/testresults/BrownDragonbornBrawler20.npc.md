***Race: Dragonborn.*** Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

***Brown Dragonborn.***

***Class: Fighter.*** Fighters share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. They are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

***Martial Archetype: Battle Master.*** Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.

***Feat: Tavern Brawler.*** You are accustomed to the rough-and-tumble fighting using whatever weapons happen to be at hand.

***Feat: Tough.*** You are harder to kill.

***Feat: Resilient.***

***Feat: Durable.*** You are hardy and resilient.
