>***Evasion.*** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
>
>***Ki (20/Recharges on short or long rest).*** Ki save DC 19.
>
>***Ki: Diamond Soul.*** Whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.
>
>***Ki: Focused Aim.*** When you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase your attack roll by 2 for each of these ki points you spend, potentially turning the miss into a hit.
>
>***Ki: Quivering Palm.*** When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage. You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.
>
>***Ki: Stunning Strike.*** When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (against your Ki save DC) or be stunned until the end of your next turn.
>
>***Martial Arts.*** When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

>
>***Tongue of the Sun and Moon.*** You learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.
>
>***Tranquility.*** At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a [sanctuary](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/sanctuary/) spell (save DC 19) that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal).
>
>#### Actions
>***Breath Weapon (7/Recharges on a long rest).*** You exhale venom in a line 5' x 30'. All creatures in the area must make a DEX saving throw, DC 18. A creature takes 4d10 poison damage on a failed save, or half on a successful one.

>
>#### Reactions
>***Deflect Missiles.*** When you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, you deflect or catch the missile, reducing the damage you take from the attack by 1d10 + 24. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack using the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught (*Ranged Weapon Attack* +11 to hit, range 20/60, one target. Hit: 1d10 + 4 damage of the ammunition's type), as part of the same reaction.

***Race: Dragonborn.*** Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

***Gray Dragonborn.***

***Class: Monk.*** Monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

***Monastic Tradition: Way of the Open Hand.*** Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.
