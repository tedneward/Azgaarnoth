>***Deep Pockets.*** During a long rest, you can enchant two containers on your person, usually a pocket or backpack that becomes the equivalent of a *bag of holding* for you. You can enchant a different container over the course of a long rest. If you do so, the first container loses its magic. If the container is filled above its capacity, if there are still items in the container when you enchant a different one, or if the container is targeted by a spell such as dispel magic or antimagic field, all of its contents spill out around you, landing in an empty adjacent space.

>
>***Stroke of Luck (Recharges on short or long rest).*** If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

>
>***Trap Sense: Evasion.*** You have advantage on saving throws against traps and their effects.

***Race: Dragonborn.*** Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

***Blue Dragonborn.***

***Class: Rogue.*** Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

***Roguish Archetype: Burglar.*** Most burglars are much more than robbers in the night. They have their sights on much more than the baubles and trinkets that they would get out of a neighbor's safe, or even than the treasures they would find in a noble's vault. Burglars aspire for hoards of legendary proportion: ancient tombs containing kingly treasure, the lost riches of a dwarven city, or even a dragon's hoard. The challenge is every bit as rewarding as the loot, and many a burglar has gotten caught only because they chose one challenge too far, not because they needed the money, but because they wanted to astound with their skill.
