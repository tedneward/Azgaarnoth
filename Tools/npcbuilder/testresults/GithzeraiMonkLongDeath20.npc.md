#### Description
Ideals: Self-knowledge/Self-knowledge/Respect

Appearance: Missing teeth

Talents: Paints beautifully

Mannerisms: Whispers

Interactions with others: Hot-tempered with others

Bond: Out for revenge

Flaw: Entirely too trusting

***Race: Githzerai.*** Githzerai were elves captured by mind flayers. Tortured and experimented on by the illithids, the githzerai later rebelled and won their freedom. These tall, gaunt folk have potent psionic powers and dwell, for the most part, on the Astral Plane.

***Class: Monk.*** Monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

***Monastic Tradition: Way of Shadow.*** Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.
