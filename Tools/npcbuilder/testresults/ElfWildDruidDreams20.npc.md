>***Balm of the Summer Court (Recharges on long rest).*** You become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that lends relief to weary feet and respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by 20 d6s.
>
>***Beast Shapes.*** You can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.
>
>***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
>
>***Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow.*** During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to ward your campsite from intruders. At the start of the rest, you create an area with a 30-foot radius. Within this area, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect creatures, and any light from open flames (campfire, torches, and the like) is not visible outside the area. These effects end when the rest finishes or when you leave the area.
>
>***Purifying Light (3/Recharges on long rest).*** When you cast a spell with a spell slot and it restores hit points to you or an ally this turn, you can simultaneously target the healed creature with [dispel magic](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/dispel-magic/), using a spell slot with a level equal to the slot used to cast the healing spell. If the healing spell targets more than one creature, you can use this feature on more than one at the same time, expending one use of it per creature.
>
>***Timeless Body.*** The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.
>
>***Trance.*** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is 'trance'. While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
>
>#### Actions
>***Hidden Paths (Recharges in 1d4 rounds).*** You can teleport up to 30 feet to a spot you can see. Each foot of this teleportation costs 1 foot of your movement. You can also use this feature to teleport a willing ally (that you touch) up to 30 feet to a point you can see.
>
>***Wild Companion.*** You can expend a use of your Wild Shape to cast [find familiar](http://azgaarnoth.tedneward.com/magic/spells/find-familiar/), without material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after 10 hours.
>
>***Wild Shape.*** You can magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1 or lower. You can stay in a beast shape for 10 hours. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

>***Animal Handling.*** You can command one friendly beast within 60 feet of you that can hear you and that isn't currently following the command of someone else. You decide now what action the beast will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you issue a general command that lasts for 1 minute, such as to guard a particular area.
>
>***Balm of the Summer Court.*** You choose an ally you can see within 120 feet of you and spend 10 or less dice. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent, and its speed increases by 5 feet per die spent. The speed increase lasts for 1 minute.

***Race: Elf.*** Elves are almost as diverse as humans in their occupations, entertainments, and while most elves have a strong familial tie between them, numerous elves have wandered away from home to make their mark within the world, then to return and take up familial responsibilities. Elves revere their familial ancestors, and will often have a shrine to a favored ancestor, but elves do not see their familial ancestors as gods, and many elves are quite comfortable serving in a religious order even as they put offerings to their revered ancestors out on important holidays.

***Subrace: Wild Elf.*** The *grugach* are those elves that sought to escape the world into the wilds. *Grugach* look almost identical to any other elves, and so will generally not raise an eyebrow when seen on the street or on board a ship. Other elves will note the subtle differences that mark the *grugach*, however, particularly after some close contact.

***Class: Druid.*** Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature, but see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.

***Druidic Circle: Circle of Dreams.*** Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild. The druids' guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with merriment and light. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places.

***Feat: Animal Handler.*** You master the techniques needed to train and handle animals.
