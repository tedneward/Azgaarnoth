>***Ambush Master.*** You have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the first creature you hit during the first round of a combat becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage until the start of your next turn.
>
>***Elusive.*** No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.
>
>***Equine Build.*** In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your hooves. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot.
>
>***Evasion.*** When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
>
>***Reliable Talent.*** Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
>
>***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, you can deal an extra 10d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
>
>***Stroke of Luck (Recharges on short or long rest).*** If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
>
>***Survivalist.*** Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of Nature or Survival.
>
>#### Actions
>***Hooves.*** Melee Weapon Attack: 8 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 1d4 + 1.
>
>#### Reactions
>***Skirmisher.*** You can move up to half your speed as a reaction when an enemy ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
>
>***Uncanny Dodge.*** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can halve the attack's damage against you.
>
>
>#### Bonus Actions
>***Charge.*** If you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can use your bonus action to make a hoof attack.
>
>***Cunning Action.*** You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. You may also your Cunning Action to carefully aim your next attack. As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
>
>***Sudden Strike.*** If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a bonus action. This attack can benefit from your Sneak Attack even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your Sneak Attack against the same target more than once in a turn.

***Race: Centaur.***

***Class: Rogue.*** Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

***Roguish Archetype: Scout.*** You are skilled in stealth and surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing you to scout ahead of your companions during expeditions. Rogues who embrace this archetype are at home in the wilderness and among barbarians and rangers, and many Scouts serve as the eyes and ears of war bands. Ambusher, spy, bounty hunter â€“ these are just a few of the roles that Scouts assume as they range the world.
