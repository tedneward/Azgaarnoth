>***Weapon Bond.*** You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated.

#### Description
Ideals: Nation/Neutrality/Discovery

Appearance: Tattoos

Talents: Distinctive speaking voice

Mannerisms: Squints

Interactions with others: Argumentative with others

Bond: Protective of close family members

Flaw: Possession of forbidden lore

***Race: Aasimar.*** 

***Fallen Aasimar.*** An aasimar who was touched by dark powers as a youth or who turns to evil in early adulthood can become one of the fallen -- a group of aasimar whose inner light has been replaced by shadow.

***Class: Fighter.*** Fighters share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. They are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

***Martial Archetype: Eldritch Knight.*** The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.

***Feat: Arcanist.*** You study the arcane arts. (If you are a member of a mage school, your cantrip and spell may be different than these given.)

***Feat: Adept of the Mage School.*** Your ambition and loyalty to the school has been recognized. (Must be a member of a mage school.)

***Feat: Eldritch Adept.*** Studying occult lore, you have unlocked eldritch power within yourself.

***Feat: Resilient.*** You are harder to kill than most.
