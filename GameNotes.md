# Generalized Game Notes
Welcome to Azgaarnoth.

## Guide
Start with the [Overview](Overview.md) to get a sense of the world and its history. The [map](Azgaarnoth.jpeg) is a view of the world from the top, and several sections have zoomed-in pieces of it to better highlight certain areas. Each map should have a ruler legend in the lower-right corner to offer scale.

## Playing in Azgaarnoth
Azgaarnoth is a world that is the collision of three major Earth-ish cultures (Western, Arabic, and Asian) alongside a more traditional Tolkien-esque "bad guy horde" (the Hordes). However, several deliberate steps have been thrown in to distance Azgaarnoth's nations and cultures from the traditional fantasy trope.

For starters, Azgaarnoth lies south of the equator, thus the various climates grow hotter to the north, and colder to the south. More than that, the world has been in steady decline for the last several milennia, and is just starting to pull its way back out. Owing to the near-constant state of conflict over the last ten milennia, the population of Azgaarnoth is quite light, as population counts go, though certainly large numbers of creatures that would never sit for a census count also populate the world. Major cities are 25,000 in size; most cities are closer to 5k to 10k beings.

Secondly, the "hordes" have fractured and split--twice. The "classic" orcs-and-goblin-hordes are in the far south, battling against a "dark" empire, whose "darkness" stems from an iron and unbending will to survive against that Horde. The second Hordes group are to the north of that, and they have begun to discover the power of civilization--and some of the restrictions and rules around it, putting them on a knife's edge of either sliding back into barbarism or moving to join the rest of the world in civilized discourse. The third is even further north, and further down the path of societal growth. Made up of stragglers who chose not to flee south, this group was ruthlessly united by a far-thinking minotaur two milennia ago, and is by far the most racially-egalitarian, not only of the Hordish world, but all of Azgaarnoth. Yithia--the lands of the Principality of Yithi and the Theocracy of Zhi--is a land that truly cares more for what one does than how one was born. This is the Asian-inspired culture, complete with many of the traditionlly Asian approaches to the world, including a strong faith in acnestral spirits and mysticism, and Yithia sports a hot, wet, grassland-and-swamp climate to go with that Asian mindset.

Thirdly, the Arabic nations--the Al'Uma--do not ride over wide dunes of sand, but grasslands. The land is still hot, but water is plentiful, and grasslands stretch from horizon to horizon. This distinctly Arab-influenced culture is split between two religious figures from their history, related by theology but distanced by doctrine, and the two battle each other incessantly only when they do not battle their more ancient enemies, the Hordes--even though those Hordes migrated south (and then south again) ages ago. The Al'Uma slowly teeter towards religious chaos as the unifying force that held them together slowly seems to be less and less relevant.

Lastly, the "Western" nations, Liria and her rebellious spawn (Travenia, Travesimia, Bedia, and so on) are nations exhausted by conflict from both inside and out. Liria was once a proud empire stretching from one corner of the map to the other, doing battle against her ancient Hordish enemies. But the stress of governance and fighting an implacable foe led to first one rebellion, then another and another and another, all of which she was unable to dispute, and unable to reclaim. Such rebellious children found governance no easier, however, and each in turn faced their own internal rebellions as well. An uneasy peace has settled across the nations of the West, but ancient distrust and unforgotten history could easily flare into open war once again.

If there is one thing the Western nations agree upon, however, it is their historical battle with the Hordes to the east, and their mututal distrust of the lands of Dradehalia to the south, where a dark, mysterious, and genuinely frightening figure has forged a brutal weapon out of the darkest of crises. The Dread Emperor rules Dradehalia with an iron fist, and nothing is known of this figure--not even if his rule for the past centuries years is by one person, or if each successor takes up the name and mantle to keep their enemies guessing. The Dread Emperor came to power by being willing to do whatever was necessary to ensure his nation's survival against the Hordes of Ulm crashing down upon his people--but in the time since, a more disturbing question arises: Is the Dread Emperor willing to let go of whatever dark and foul magics and deeds he felt necessary to secure his peoples' freedom, or will he seek to conquer the known world, in the name of that "security"?
