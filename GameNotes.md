# Generalized Game Notes

## Homebrew Rules
I like these rules, and look to use them in the campaign. (The Silver Monetary Standard I will quietly slip in to places.)

### Magic Item Attunement
You can attune three magic items, or a number equal to your proficiency bonus, whichever is greater.

### Decisiveness Bonus (DB)
A player's character receives a +1 bonus to any die roll during the round *if* they can announce their action within 3 seconds of the start of their turn.

### Bonus Action Slots
Each character has three "slots" in which they can store items that can be reached as a bonus action. Potions kept here can be quaffed as a bonus action; scrolls kept here can be pulled out and used immediately as an action (casting time pending), and so on. Includes weapons.

### The Silver Monetary Standard
Roughly, one silver is what a day's room and board in a low-quality inn goes for.

100cp = 1sp
100sp = 1gp

Any non-magical gear in the PHB is converted from gp to sp.

### Burrow
*movement option*

A creature that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. Most forms of burrowing (such as the burrow spell) don't allow you to burrow through solid rock.

A creature's reach with melee attacks is not considered to extend into the floor, walls, ceiling, or other obstacles. Thus a creature who burrows into the ground will trigger opportunity attacks before it gains total cover from the ground.

### Tremorsense
*sense*

A creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the creature and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.

## Game Source Material
Sourcebooks used, all D&D 5th Edition unless noted otherwise:

All copyrights are held by their respective owners; anyone not a part of my play group should feel obligated to obtain the original materials for any purpose beyond that of playing in my group.

Note that much of this material is moving over into specific entries, so I can better control the customization and application of the material to the world. Not all material from each book is relevant to this world, so I am incorporating and weaving it in as time (and game demand) permits, so as to present a more seamless whole. In time, the goal will be that aside from the basic rules, one would need nothing else but this repository to play within this world. (GM'ing it would be another matter entirely.)
