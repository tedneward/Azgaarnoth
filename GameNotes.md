All copyrights are held by their respective owners; I have only included the PDFs of freely-available material from the D&D website as a convenience to my players, and anyone not a part of my play group should obtain the materials from there, instead.

Note that much of this material is moving over into specific entries, so I can better control the customization and application of the material to the world.

## Races
The world used to belong to the [Eldar](/Races/Eldar.md) but they have long disappeared. [Humans](/Races/Human.md) are the numerically dominant (~50%) race. Dwarves and elves are plentiful, not restricted to traditional roles or geography, and are referred to as the [Firstborn](/Races/Firstborn.md). Dragonborn, tieflings, and aasimar were/are [Created](/Races/Created.md). Players seeking to play a non-traditional race almost certainly come from the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md) somewhere in their background.

*The Book of Dragons* describes platinum dragonborn, dragonkin, and half-dragons as playable races. These are all present in Azgaarnoth.

## Classes

### [Mystic](/Supplements/UAMystic3.pdf)
Mystics are found in a number of mage schools, and are thicker than thieves in the Great Library of the [Order of the Brass Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Brass.md). In fact, it is said that mystics were the first thing that the Library began collecting.

The various mystic Orders are scattered throughout the culture of Azgaarnoth:
* The Order of the Immortal is usually found among the [Mercenary Companies](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md) and [Dueling Colleges](/Organizations/DuelingColleges.md).
* The Order of the Awakened is a [Mage School](/Organizations/MageSchools/MageSchools.md).
* The Order of the Nomad is most often found among the barbarians of the Ravenlands.
* The Order of the Soul Knife is found within several [Dueling Colleges](/Organizations/DuelingColleges.md), though they do not advertise, preferring instead to approach those who display talent and introduce them to the discipline. (Doing so immediately "retires" them from active competition, and Soul Knife duelists usually become clandestine or take up a more mercenary career.)
* The Order of the Wu Jen is a [Mage School](/Organizations/MageSchools/MageSchools.md), most often found in [Zhi](/Nations/Zhi.md)
