# Generalized Game Notes
Sourebooks used, all 5th Edition unless noted otherwise:
* "Player's Handbook"
* "Dungeon Master's Guide"
* "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes"
* "Xanathar's Guide to Everything"
* "*The Book of Dragons*" (written by Conner McCall)

All copyrights are held by their respective owners; I have only included the PDFs of freely-available material from the D&D website as a convenience to my players, and anyone not a part of my play group should obtain the materials from there, instead.

Note that much of this material is moving over into specific entries, so I can better control the customization and application of the material to the world.

## Races
The world used to belong to the [Eldar](/Races/Eldar.md) but they have long disappeared. [Humans](/Races/Human.md) are the numerically dominant (~50%) race. Dwarves and elves are plentiful, not restricted to traditional roles or geography, and are referred to as the [Firstborn](/Races/Firstborn.md). Dragonborn, tieflings, and aasimar were/are [Created](/Races/Created.md). Players seeking to play a non-traditional race almost certainly come from the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md) somewhere in their background.

*The Book of Dragons* describes platinum dragonborn, dragonkin, and half-dragons as playable races. These are all present in Azgaarnoth.

## Classes

### Barbarian
* *Path of the Dragon* barbarians (from *The Book of Dragons*) is almost always part of a [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md) in some fashion--either his/her tribe is an ally to the Order, or the barbarian was somehow influenced significantly by the Order, but in some non-trivial way, the Order weighs heavily on the barbarian.


### Bard
The various Bardic Colleges are formal organizations within Azgaarnoth; while a bard does not need to study at the respective college to follow the path (or gain the powers), most do in order to be officially recognized by the College and thus gain the backing of the organization in times of need.
* The [College of Creation](/Organizations/BardicColleges/Creation.md) is quite popular among the [Al'Uma](/Religions/Al'Uma.md), though of course the bards are singing of the [Eldar](/Races/Eldar.md) when they speak of the power of creation. The Colleges can be found in many Al'Uman cities, and in a few outside of Al'Uma as well.
* The [College of Glamour](/Organizations/BardicColleges/Glamour.md) is quite popular among the [Mercenary Companies](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md) as they incite the troops to greater and greater ideals, or tell the oral histories of the companies around the campfire during the march. This College is often found in any city which has a mercenary company wintering nearby.
* The [College of Lore](/Organizations/BardicColleges/Lore.md) is one operated out of the Great Academy of the [Brass Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Brass.md). These bards are often scholars and are paid by the Academy to discover new facts about Azgaarnoth.
* The [College of Swords](/Organizations/BardicColleges/Swords.md) is the least-restrictive of the Bardic Colleges, accepting nearly anyone of any musical or athletic talent. These bards are often found out in the sketchiest places of the world, and many have found employment as an agent of the [Copper Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Copper.md). The College itself provides campuses in almost any major city in Azgaarnoth.
* The [College of Valor](/Organizations/BardicColleges/Valor.md) is one of the most-restrictive of the Bardic Colleges, and is found in [Flakew](/Cities/Flakew.md) operated by the [Lirian Imperial Court](/Nations/Liria.md). They are frequently charged with wandering the countryside and inspiring the people to press onwards in Liria's struggles to recover from the blows she has suffered since the [Fall of the Eldar](/History/Ancient.md). Many of the other nations, including [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md) have followed suit, and as such bards of this college but opposing nations have frequently gotten into "battles of the bards" in roadside taverns as each tries to out-inspire the other(s).
* The [College of Whispers](/Organizations/BardicColleges/Whispers.md) is rumored to be run by the [Copper Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Copper.md), although it is also said that they are operated by the [Dread Emperor](/People/DreadEmperor.md), or any of the other nations of Azgaarnoth. It is entirely possible (and likely) that, like the College of Valor, there are multiple colleges of Whispers within Azgaarnoth.
* The *College of Dragonsong* (from *The Book of Dragons*) is one operated by the [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md), specifically the [Brass](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Brass.md). Anyone choosing this college should expect be deeply involved in the Order's activities in some fashion.


### Dragonbound (from *The Book of Dragons*)
Dragonbound are always either members of the [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md) or the [CultOfTheWyrm](/Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md); given that actual dragons (as opposed to their agents or the Order) are exceedingly rare in the world, a dragonbound will be an immediate target for both groups as soon as even the slightest whisper of their existence leaks forth--campaigns involving a dragonbound should expect to be fast, furious, and epic.


### Druid
Druids following the Circle of Dragons (from *The Book of Dragons*) will almost inevitably come under the eye of the [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md), most likely one of the [Copper](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Copper.md), for security.


### Fighter
Dragon Knight Martial Archetypes (from *The Book of Dragons*) are members of a [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md), usually the [Gold](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Gold.md) or the [Bronze](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Bronze.md).

Dragon Slayer Martial Archetypes (from *The Book of Dragons*) are only available to characters who have close ties to the [Dread Emperor](/People/DreadEmperor.md) of [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md); any Dragon Slayer met by any member of a [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md) will often be attacked on sight.

### Monk
Monastic orders are found in many corners of Azgaarnoth, often in less-trafficked areas. Many of these monasteries are actually mobile, meaning a master who has one or more apprentices following her, learning from their master's wisdom and example. All three Ways (Way of the Open Hand, Way of Shadow, and Way of the Four Elements) are available. Open Hand monks often have one or more connections to a [Mercenary Company](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md). Shadow monks are affiliated with Rogues' Guilds as well as with the [Order of the Copper Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Copper.md). Four Elements monks are found anywhere in the world, but within the [Al'Uma](/Cultures/AlUma.md), *al'maera* revere these monks in particular for their affinity to the air and water.

Monks wishing to follow the Monasic Tradition of the Way of the Dragon (from *The Book of Dragons*) will be a member of either the [Gold](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Gold.md) or [Bronze](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Bronze.md) [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md). Seeking to learn this Way will often require joining the Order or finding a master from the Order to teach it.


### [Mystic](/Supplements/UAMystic3.pdf)
Mystics are found in a number of mage schools, and are thicker than thieves in the Great Library of the [Order of the Brass Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Brass.md). In fact, it is said that mystics were the first thing that the Library began collecting.

The various mystic Orders are scattered throughout the culture of Azgaarnoth:
* The Order of the Immortal is usually found among the [Mercenary Companies](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md) and [Dueling Colleges](/Organizations/DuelingColleges.md).
* The Order of the Awakened is a [Mage School](/Organizations/MageSchools/MageSchools.md).
* The Order of the Nomad is most often found among the barbarians of the Ravenlands.
* The Order of the Soul Knife is found within several [Dueling Colleges](/Organizations/DuelingColleges.md), though they do not advertise, preferring instead to approach those who display talent and introduce them to the discipline. (Doing so immediately "retires" them from active competition, and Soul Knife duelists usually become clandestine or take up a more mercenary career.)
* The Order of the Wu Jen is a [Mage School](/Organizations/MageSchools/MageSchools.md), most often found in [Zhi](/Nations/Zhi.md)

### Paladin
Those paladins swearing an *Oath of the Dragon* Sacred Oath (from *The Book of Dragons*) will be either a member of either the [Gold](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Gold.md) or [Bronze](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Bronze.md) [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md); at later levels they may be invited to join the [Platinum](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Platinum.md).

### Ranger
Rangers who wish to join a Conclave of Dragonstalkers (from *The Book of Dragons*) will only find such Conclaves in the south in [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md). Should the Ranger Dragonstalker become known as such anywhere outside of that nation, they will be viewed with suspicion or outright hostility, most particularly in [Liria](/Nations/Liria.md).

### Wizard
The [Psionics Arcane Tradition](/Supplements/UA-PsychicSoulPsionics.pdf) is embodied in the [MindMage](/Organizations/MageSchools/MindMage.md) mage school, and most practitioners of this tradition hail from that school. A few "wilder" wizards may also have the tradition and are willing to teach, but these will be few and far between.
