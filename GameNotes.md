# Generalized Game Notes
Sourebooks used, all 5th Edition unless noted otherwise:
* "Player's Handbook"
* "Dungeon Master's Guide"
* "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes"
* "Xanathar's Guide to Everything"

## Races
The world used to belong to the [Eldar](/Races/Eldar.md) but they have long disappeared. [Humans](/Races/Human.md) are the numerically dominant (~50%) race. Dwarves and elves are plentiful, not restricted to traditional roles or geography, and are referred to as the [Firstborn](/Races/Firstborn.md). Dragonborn, tieflings, and aasimar were/are [Created](/Races/Created.md). Players seeking to play a non-traditional race almost certainly come from the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md) somewhere in their background.

*The Book of Dragons* describes platinum dragonborn, dragonkin, and half-dragons as playable races. These are all present in Azgaarnoth.

[Dragonmarked](/Supplements/UA_Dragonmarks.pdf) are generally "born wild" and, once known, very quickly hunted down by either the [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md) or the [Cult of the Wyrm](/Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md), to either recruit or destroy. Unlike in Eberron, dragonmarked are not part of a particular [noble House](/Organizations/Houses/Houses.md), but bloodlines do carry, and many of the noble Houses carry the dragonmark within their bloodlines... as do most of the other races by this point in Azgaarnoth's history. It is believed that the dragonmark dates back to the very earliest days of the [Eldar](/Races/Eldar.md), and that the Eldar handed out the dragonmark to favored [Firstborn](/Races/Firstborn.md) or [humans](/Races/Humans.md) as rewards for excellent service. No [Created](/Races/Created.md) have ever borne a dragonmark.


## Classes

### Barbarian
When considering barbarian paths, consider these facts:
* [Path of the Ancestral Guardian](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#PathoftheAncestralGuardian) barbarians are most commonly found among the [United Hordes](/Nations/Tragekia.md) or [Yithi](/Nations/Yithi.md).
* [Path of the Beast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#PathoftheBeastUA) barbarians are often found at the fringes of civilization, in [North Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md); some may have emerged amongst the chaos in [Chidia](/Geography/Chidia.md) but will generally want to keep their bestial nature a little disguised.
* [Path of the Berserker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#PathoftheBerserker) is actually a very common path for barbarians who join up with one of the [Mercenary Companies](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md).
* [Path of the Storm Herald](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#PathoftheStormHerald) barbarians can be found in quite a few places, most notably in the [Ravenlands](/Geography/Ravenlands.md), the [United Hordes](/Nations/Tragekia.md), or [North Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md).
* [Path of the Totem Warrior](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#PathoftheTotemWarrior) barbarians are usually found among the [Yithi](/Nations/Yithi.md) or [Zhi](/Nations/Zhi.md).
* [Path of the Wild Soul](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#PathoftheWildSoulUA) barbarians are rare, and often found in [Zhi](/Nations/Zhi.md) owing to that nation's deep emphasis on the appreciation of beauty. Many of them journey into [Yithi](/Nations/Yithi.md), or beyond, in search of greater beauty.
* [Path of the Zealot](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#PathoftheZealot) barbarians are quite common among the [Al'Uma](/Cultures/AlUma.md), particularly among the nomads, but are also frequently bound to one of the [Pantheonic gods](/Religions/Pantheon.md) or even, at times, the [Kaevarian Church](/Religions/KaevarianChurch.md), though in the latter case usually in [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md).
* [Path of the Depths](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#PathoftheDepthsPartnered) barbarians are always (almost without exception) of the *al'maera* of the [Al'Uma](/Religions/AlUma.md), and are often sworn to destroy some enemy of the [Undersea](/Geography/Undersea.md), most often the one that caused the trauma to the barbarian in the first place.
* *Path of the Dragon* barbarians (from *The Book of Dragons*) is almost always part of a [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md) in some fashion--either his/her tribe is an ally to the Order, or the barbarian was somehow influenced significantly by the Order, but in some non-trivial way, the Order weighs heavily on the barbarian.

### Bard
The various Bardic Colleges relate thusly in Azgaarnoth:
* The [College of Creation](/Organizations/BardicColleges/Creation.md) is quite popular among the [Al'Uma](/Religions/Al'Uma.md), though of course the bards are singing of the [Eldar](/Races/Eldar.md) when they speak of the power of creation.
* The [College of Glamour](/Organizations/BardicColleges/Glamour.md) is quite popular among the [Mercenary Companies](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md) as they incite the troops to greater and greater ideals, or tell the oral histories of the companies around the campfire during the march.
* The [College of Lore](/Organizations/BardicColleges/Lore.md) is one operated out of the Great Academy of the [Brass Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Brass.md). These bards are often scholars and are paid by the Academy to discover new facts about Azgaarnoth.
* The [College of Swords](/Organizations/BardicColleges/Swords.md) is the least-restrictive of the Bardic Colleges, accepting nearly anyone of any musical or athletic talent. These bards are often found out in the sketchiest places of the world, and many have found employment as an agent of the [Copper Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Copper.md).
* The [College of Valor](/Organizations/BardicColleges/Valor.md) is one of the most-restrictive of the Bardic Colleges, and is found in [Flakew](/Cities/Flakew.md) operated by the [Lirian Imperial Court](/Nations/Liria.md). They are frequently charged with wandering the countryside and inspiring the people to press onwards in Liria's struggles to recover from the blows she has suffered since the [Fall of the Eldar](/History/Ancient.md). Many of the other nations, including [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md) have followed suit, and as such bards of this college but opposing nations have frequently gotten into "battles of the bards" in roadside taverns as each tries to out-inspire the other(s).
* The [College of Whispers](/Organizations/BardicColleges/Whispers.md) is rumored to be run by the [Copper Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Copper.md), although it is also said that they are operated by the [Dread Emperor](/People/DreadEmperor.md), or any of the other nations of Azgaarnoth. It is entirely possible (and likely) that, like the College of Valor, there are multiple colleges of Whispers within Azgaarnoth.
* The *College of Dragonsong* (from *The Book of Dragons*) is one operated by the [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md), specifically the [Brass](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Brass.md). Anyone choosing this college should expect be deeply involved in the Order's activities in some fashion.


### Cleric
Several major religions dot the surface of Azgaarnoth:
* The [Pantheon](/Religions/Pantheon.md) is the classic multitheistic panoply of gods and goddesses arranged (more or less) by domain of the cosmos. Within the Pantheon, the following domains are available: Arcana (from *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide*), [Life](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#LifeDomain), [Death](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#DeathDomain), [Grave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#GraveDomain), [Trickery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#TrickeryDomain), [War](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#WarDomain), [Tempest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#TempestDomain), [Forge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#ForgeDomain), [Knowledge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#KnowledgeDomain), [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#LightDomain), [Twilight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#TwilightDomainUA), Shadow, [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#NatureDomain), Draconic (from *The Book of Dragons*).

* The [Al'Uma](/Religions/AlUma.md) believe that the world has entered its current state because mortals did not worship the beings that maintained it, and therefore it is mortals' responsibility to correct that, by either worship, combat, or both. Typically a [Zalabasa](/Nations/Zalabasa.md)n cleric will be of [War](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#WarDomain),  [Life](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#LifeDomain), or [Order](/Supplements/UA_OrderDomain.pdf), an [Alalihat](/Nations/Alalihat)ian cleric will be  [Life](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#LifeDomain), [Order](/Supplements/UA_OrderDomain.pdf), or [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#LightDomain), an [Almalz](/Nations/Almalz.md)ish cleric will have all domains available except Death, Grave, or Twilight, and an *al'maeran* cleric will almost always choose either [Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#NatureDomain) (with an emphasis on the sea) or [Tempest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#TempestDomain).

* The [Kaevarian Church](/Religions/KaevarianChurch.md) is a monotheistic religion that actually encompasses all of the Pantheon (and the Eldar) as agents of a singular entity (Kaevar). Generally these clerics will be of  [Life](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#LifeDomain), [Order](/Supplements/UA_OrderDomain.pdf), [Knowledge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#KnowledgeDomain), [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#LightDomain) or [Unity](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/cleric#UnityDomainUA) domains, but a player wishing to be Kaevarian of a different domain can make the theological argument that since "all is Kaevar", so, too, should this domain be represented, and have solid theological ground on which to stand. Most Kaevarians would reject anything to do with chaos or evil; however, the branches of the Kaevarian Church in [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md) have been known to flirt with those domains as part of the [Dread Emperor](/People/DreadEmperor.md)'s plans.

* Draconic Domain (from *The Book of Dragons*) clerics are always a member of the [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md), or (for evil clerics) a member of the [Cult of the Wyrm](/Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md), depending on whether they follow a metallic or chromatic dragon.


### Dragonbound (from *The Book of Dragons*)
Dragonbound are always either members of the [Draconic Order]() or the [CultOfTheWyrm](); given that actual dragons (as opposed to their agents or the Order) are exceedingly rare in the world, a dragonbound will be an immediate target for both groups as soon as even the slightest whisper of their existence leaks forth--campaigns involving a dragonbound should expect to be fast, furious, and epic.

### Druid
Druids follow the path of [Druidism](/Religions/Druidism.md) and carve their own path.

Druids following the Circle of Dragons (from *The Book of Dragons*) will almost inevitably come under the eye of the [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md), most likely one of the [Copper](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Copper.md), for security.


### Fighter
Champion Martial Archetypes are frequently found in [Mercenary Companies](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md). They are often not the leader of the company, but used as a rallying point during combat.

Battle Master Martial Archetypes are frequently found in [Mercenary Companies](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md), and often at some point study at the Great Academy maintained by the [Order of the Bronze Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Bronze.md).

Eldritch Knight Martial Archetypes are often found near or around [Mage Schools](/Organizations/MageSchools/MageSchools.md), particularly the [FieryFist](/Organizations/MageSchools/FieryFirst.md) or [CrimsonSunrise](/Organizations/MageSchools/CrimsonSunrise.md) schools; that said, there are dozens of mage schools that focus on combat magic, and an Eldritch Knight would be welcome in any of them.

Dragon Knight Martial Archetypes (from *The Book of Dragons*) are members of a [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md), usually the [Gold](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Gold.md) or the [Bronze](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Bronze.md).

Dragon Slayer Martial Archetypes (from *The Book of Dragons*) are only available to characters who have close ties to the [Dread Emperor](/People/DreadEmperor.md) of [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md); any Dragon Slayer met by any member of a [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md) will often be attacked on sight.

[Psychic Warrior Martial Archetypes](/Supplements/UA-PsychicSoulPsionics.pdf) are only available to characters who have close ties to the [MindMage](/Organizations/MageSchools/MindMage.md) mage school. They will be welcome among any [Mercenary Company](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md) if they wish to take employment.


### Monk
Monastic orders are found in many corners of Azgaarnoth, often in less-trafficked areas. Many of these monasteries are actually mobile, meaning a master who has one or more apprentices following her, learning from their master's wisdom and example. All three Ways (Way of the Open Hand, Way of Shadow, and Way of the Four Elements) are available. Open Hand monks often have one or more connections to a [Mercenary Company](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md). Shadow monks are affiliated with Rogues' Guilds as well as with the [Order of the Copper Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Copper.md). Four Elements monks are found anywhere in the world, but within the [Al'Uma](/Cultures/AlUma.md), *al'maera* revere these monks in particular for their affinity to the air and water.

Monks wishing to follow the Monasic Tradition of the Way of the Dragon (from *The Book of Dragons*) will be a member of either the [Gold](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Gold.md) or [Bronze](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Bronze.md) [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md). Seeking to learn this Way will often require joining the Order or finding a master from the Order to teach it.

### [Mystic](/Supplements/Psionics_and_Mystic_V2.md)
Each of the Mystic Orders is a [Mage School](/Organizations/MageSchools/MageSchools.md). They do not advertise that they use psionics, but all magi know that these two orders do things "a little differently".

### Paladin
Paldin *Oaths of Devotion* are often sworn to the [Order of the Gold Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Gold.md). *Oath of the Ancients* usually swear to the [Eldar](/Races/Eldar.md) alongside the elves and druids. *Oath of Vengeance* is often sworn amongst the knights of [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md) against the [Ulmhorde](/Nations/Ulm.md), and many are in fact following the example set by the [DreadEmperor](/People/DreadEmperor.md) in doing so.

Those paladins swearing an *Oath of the Dragon* Sacred Oath (from *The Book of Dragons*) will be either a member of either the [Gold](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Gold.md) or [Bronze](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Bronze.md) [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md); at later levels they may be invited to join the [Platinum](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Platinum.md).


### Ranger
Rangers who wish to join a Conclave of Dragonstalkers (from *The Book of Dragons*) will only find such Conclaves in the south in [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md). Should the Ranger Dragonstalker become known as such anywhere outside of that nation, they will be viewed with suspicion or outright hostility, most particularly in [Liria](/Nations/Liria.md).

### Rogue
The [Soulknife Roguish Archetype](/Supplements/UA-PsychicSoulPsionics.pdf) usually manifest on their own, with no master needed, but rumors persist of a Rogues' Guild of assassins that seek to bring all of the Soulknives in the world under their control (or at least within their influence).

### Warlock


### Wizard
The [Psionics Arcane Tradition](/Supplements/UA-PsychicSoulPsionics.pdf) is embodied in the [MindMage](/Organizations/MageSchools/MindMage.md) mage school, and most practitioners of this tradition hail from that school. A few "wilder" wizards may also have the tradition and are willing to teach, but these will be few and far between.
