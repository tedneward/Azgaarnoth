# Generalized Game Notes
Welcome to Azgaarnoth.

## Guide
Start with the [Overview](Overview.md) to get a sense of the world and its history. The [map](Azgaarnoth.jpeg) is a view of the world from the top, and several sections have zoomed-in pieces of it to better highlight certain areas. Each map should have a ruler legend in the lower-right corner to offer scale.

## Playing in Azgaarnoth
Azgaarnoth is a world that is the collision of three major Earth-ish cultures (Western, Arabic, and Asian) alongside a more traditional Tolkien-esque "bad guy horde" (the Hordes). However, several deliberate steps have been thrown in to distance Azgaarnoth's nations and cultures from the traditional fantasy trope.

For starters, Azgaarnoth lies south of the equator, thus the various climates grow hotter to the north, and colder to the south. More than that, the world has been in steady decline for the last several milennia, and is just starting to pull its way back out. Owing to the near-constant state of conflict over the last ten milennia, the population of Azgaarnoth is quite light, as population counts go, though certainly large numbers of creatures that would never sit for a census count also populate the world. Major cities are 25,000 to 50,000 in size; most cities are closer to 5k to 10k beings.

In the [center](/Geography/Liria.md) and [western](/Geography/Bedia.md) portions of the Azgaarnothian map, the "Western" nations, [Liria](/Nations/Liria.md) and her rebellious spawn ([Travenia](/Nations/Travenia.md), [Travesimia](/Nations/Travesimia.md), [Bedia](/Nations/Bedia.md), and others), are nations exhausted by conflict from both inside and out. Liria was once a proud empire stretching from one corner of the map to the other, doing battle against her ancient Hordish enemies. But the stress of governance and fighting an implacable foe led to first one rebellion, then another and another and another, all of which she was unable to dispute and unable to reclaim. Such rebellious children found governance no easier, either. Each in turn faced their own internal rebellions as well. An uneasy peace has settled across the nations of the West, but ancient distrust and unforgotten history could easily flare into open war once again, particularly if looming threats fade and leave no easy enemy to unite against. To the southwest, on the continent of [Chidia](/Geography/Chidia.md), three major powers engage in near-constant warfare with one another, battling by proxy there, lest the carnage of war strike too close to homes too recently ravaged and barely recovered.

To the northeast, where the land is still hot, but water is plentiful and grasslands stretch from horizon to horizon, the religious-dominant nations of [Al'Uma](/Geography/AlUma.md), formed of tribes of horse-borne who ride over those wide grasslands, where they wrestle with each other over theology, ancient grievances, and sometimes just for fun. This distinctly Arab-influenced culture is split between two religious figures from their history, related by theology but distanced by doctrine, and the two battle each other incessantly only when they do not battle their more ancient enemies, the Hordes--even though those Hordes migrated south (and then south again) ages ago. The Al'Uma slowly teeter towards religious chaos as the unifying force that held them together slowly seems to be less and less relevant.

In the east and southeast, the Hordes themselves have fractured and split--twice. The ["classic" orcs-and-goblin-hordes](/Nations/Ulm.md), the Hordes of Ulm, are in the far south, battling against [a "dark" empire](/Nations/Dradehalia.md), Dradehalia, whose "darkness" stems from an iron and unbending will to survive against that Horde. The [second group of Hordes](/Nations/Tragekia.md), the United Hordes of Tragekia, lie to the north of Ulm. The Tragekians have begun to discover the power of civilization--and some of the restrictions and rules around it--and rest on a knife's edge of either sliding back into barbarism or moving to join the rest of the world in civilized discourse. The third of the Hordish collectives is even further north, and further down the path of societal growth. Made up of stragglers who chose not to flee south, this group was ruthlessly united by a far-thinking minotaur two milennia ago, and is by far the most racially-egalitarian, not only of the Hordish world, but all of Azgaarnoth. [Yithia](/Geography/Yithia.md)--the lands of the [Principality of Yithi](/Nations/Yithi.md) and the [Theocracy of Zhi](/Nations/Zhi.md)--is a land that truly cares more for what one does than how one was born. This is the Asian-inspired culture, complete with many of the traditionlly Asian approaches to the world, including a strong faith in acnestral spirits and mysticism, and Yithia sports a hot, wet, grassland-and-swamp climate to go with that Asian mindset.

To the south stands the lands of [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md) and the [Ulmhorde](/Nations/Ulm.md), both forbidding and foreboding. Dradehalia, where a dark, mysterious, and genuinely frightening figure has forged a brutal weapon out of the darkest of crises. Known only by the moniker of "Dread Emperor", he rules with an iron fist, and nothing further is known--not even if his rule for the past centuries is by one person, or if each successor takes up the name and mantle to keep their enemies guessing. The Dread Emperor came to power by being willing to do whatever was necessary to ensure his nation's survival against the howling Hordes of Ulm (who keep to the pillaging and plundering "old ways" of the Hordes) crashing down upon his people--but in the time since, a more disturbing question arises: Is the Dread Emperor willing to let go of whatever dark and foul magics and deeds he felt necessary to secure his peoples' freedom, or will he utilize them and enhance them, seduced by them to seek to conquer the known world, all in the name of that "security"?

To the far west, wilderness has reclaimed much of what once (according to legend) was civilized ground--where once roads and cities might have flourished, only ruins and overgrown forest now stands. Northern Bedia is a landmass easily rivalling that of any other in Azgaarnoth, yet currently hosts only two minor cities, and a small handful of villages, towns. Deep forests, tall mountains, and rich wildnerness offer opportunity and danger in equally vast quantities.

In short, Azgaarnoth finds itself at something of a crossroads--while the unyielding enemy against which they have struggled for several milennia seems to be slowing down and/or looking to integrate more with the world, the unity they once had has long since fractured and split. With so many different axes of alliance and power, so many different groups working to cross-purposes (even if they seek the same end result), and so many different players on the world's stage looking to advance their own cause (or tear down another's), will Azgaarnoth ever reach a point of true peace? Or will all slowly but surely backslide into increasing chaos and anarchy, until nothing but the barest rudiments of society exist, trampled repeatedly under the iron-shod boots of weary soldiers following orders dispatched from the iron-clad grips of warlords, dictators, and would-be consquerors?

All assuming something more dark isn't waiting in the shadows for the right time to strike, of course....

## Character-creation Starting point

### Races

Azgaarnoth was first populated by the [Eldar](/Races/Eldar.md), who made the [Firstborn](/Races/Firstborn.md) ([dwarves](/Races/Dwarves.md) and [elves](/Races/Elves.md) and their kin), then later the [Humans](/Races/Humans.md) and the [Created](/Races/Created.md). Outside of the Eldar's control, however, another force descended upon Azgaarnoth: the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md), consisting of many races ([Orcs](/Races/Orc.md), [Hobgoblins](/Races/Hobgoblins.md) and [Minotaurs](/Races/Minotaurs.md) being only three of many), and waged incessant war on the Eldar for thousands of years before "settling into" the current political structure. Even the oceans serve as a source, as the [Undersea](/Races/Undersea.md) races have begun to exert their presence on the surface, and the lands beneath the surface, the Underdark, hold their own nations and civilization.

Note that as a player, you can either use the legacy D&D 5e rules for racial construction, or if you choose, examine the [Ancestry and Culture](/Races/AncestryAndCulture.md) section. *(More detail needs to be there, but it's basically a "let's talk backstory" exercise with the GM.)*

### Classes

All the traditional classes are here: [Barbarian](/Classes/Barbarian.md), [Bard](/Classes/Bard.md), [Cleric](/Classes/Cleric.md), [Druid](/Classes/Druid.md), [Fighter](/Classes/Fighter.md), [Monk](/Classes/Monk.md), [Paladin](/Classes/Paladin.md), [Ranger](/Classes/Ranger.md), [Rogue](/Classes/Rogue), [Sorceror](/Classes/Sorcerer.md), [Warlock](/Classes/Warlock.md) and [Wizard](/Classes/Wizard). In addition, several new classes roam the Azgaarnothian lands: [Artificer](/Classes/Artificer.md)s look to build the weapons and tools they need to get by in the world, [Mystic](/Classes/Mystic.md)s peer into the shadows using the power of their mind, [Pale Master](/Classes/PaleMaster.md)s prefer to explore the darker areas of necromancy and undeath, and [Shaman](/Classes/Shaman.md)s work with the spirit world all around them to guide and protect them.

Additionally, for those players whose characters have reached some success and are looking for futher specialization, several [prestige classes](/Classes/Prestige.md) are available for multiclass: [Adamant Champion](/Classes/Prestige/AdamantChampion.md), [Banneret](/Classes/Prestige/Banneret.md), [Crypt Lord](/Classes/Prestige/CryptLord.md), [Glyph Caster](/Classes/Prestige/GlyphCaster.md), [Guardian](/Classes/Prestige/Guardian.md), [Incarnate](/Classes/Prestige/Incarnate.md), [Leader](/Classes/Prestige/Leader.md), [Rune Scribe](/Classes/Prestige/RuneScribe.md) and [Tattoo Adept](/Classes/Prestige/TattooAdept.md). *(I haven't used prestige classes before, so let's talk before you get your heart set on them--we may need to tinker.)*

### Organizations

Curious to know where and how your character fits in to the Azgaarnothian fabric of society? Csondier the various [cultures](/Cultures/Cultures.md) and [Backgrounds](/Cultures/Backgrounds.md) available. *(Note that this is not particularly strongly fleshed-out yet.)* 

Then take a look at the various [organizations](/Organizations/Overview.md) that make up the world. Nobility, arcane, divine, militant, merchant, monastic, and roguish, there's any number of different forces at work trying to shape Azgaarnoth's future.

### Religions

Azgaarnoth holds many different beings as divine: the [Kaevarian Church](/Religions/KaevarianChurch.md) is monotheistic, believing that Kaevar, the One, is the only being worthy of veneration. The [Trinitarians](/Religions/Trinitarian.md) broke from Kaevar millennia ago, believing in the Three-in-One instead. The [Al'Uma](/Religions/AlUma.md), on the other hand, put their faith in the Prophet... or his Disciple, the Apostate... instead. Still others quietly believe in the [Dailian Heresy](/Religions/Dail.md) and seek to avoid drawing on any divine power whatsoever, lest they reduce the gods to nothing. Others hold beliefs in a [pantheon of deities](/Religions/Pantheon.md), while still others seek to find the [divine in nature](/Religions/Druidism.md) or in [spirits](/Religions/Spirits.md). No one religion dominates the world--and most have strong opinions over which one should.

### History

Curious as to the history of Azgaarnoth? Start with the [Timeline](/History/Timeline.md), or perhaps dive into the [Ancient](/History/Ancient.md) tales told around the tables of scholarly discussion. Or perhaps you prefer to understand the [modern world](/History/Modern.md), instead. *(Keep in mind some of this evolved a little as I was creating, so if there's some inconsistencies, let me know, I'd like to find and resolve them.)*

All copyrights are held by their respective owners; anyone not a part of my play group should feel obligated to obtain the original materials for any purpose beyond that of playing in my group.

Note that much of this material is moving over into specific entries, so I can better control the customization and application of the material to the world. Not all material from each book is relevant to this world, so I am incorporating and weaving it in as time (and game demand) permits, so as to present a more seamless whole. In time, the goal will be that aside from the basic rules, one would need nothing else but this repository to play within this world. (GM'ing it would be another matter entirely.)
