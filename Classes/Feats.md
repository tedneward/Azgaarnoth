## Aberrant [Dragonmark](/Races/Dragonmarked.md)
*Prerequisite: No existing dragonmark.*

The twelve original dragonmarks, passed down from the Eldar through countless generations, have prven to be reliable and predictable, and their powers are constructive. They create; they heal; they protect.

But there is another kind of dragonmark: marks that are unpredictable and dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Someone with such a mark can kill with a touch or control minds with a glance. Aberrant marks often appear when people from different dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason such unions are absolutely forbidden by the Twelve. But aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike; even if they grant the same power, they may appear and manifest in different ways. If two aberrant marks might grant fire bolt, one mark may be formed from scar tissue while another is traced on the skin in lines of cold fire.

You have manifested such an aberrant dragonmark. Determine its appearance and the flaw associated with it.

While aberrant dragonmarks can be disturbing, on the surface an aberrant mark seems no more dangerous or threatening than the powers of a sorcerer. So, what makes them significant? Aberrant marks always have flaws. These may not actively hurt a character, but they are always a burden in some way---a burden that could drive a weak-willed person to madness. If you develop an aberrant mark, you can choose a flaw from this list, or you and the DM can develop a unique flaw of your own.

**Aberrant Mark Flaw**
1d8 | Aberrant Mark Flaw
--- | ------------------
1 | Your mark is a source of constant pain.
2 | Your mark whispers to you, though you may not understand what it says.
3 | In times of stress, your mark may trigger a cantrip effect involuntarily.
4 | The skin around your mark has an unusual appearance: burned, scaly, withered, etc.
5 | Mundane animals become uneasy around you.
6 | You have dramatic mood swings any time you use your mark.
7 | Your appearance changes in some minor way every time you use your mark.
8 | You have horrific nightmares after you use your mark.

You gain the following benefits.
* Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You learn a cantrip from the sorcerer spell list. In addition, choose a 1st-level spell from the sorcerer spell list. You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
* You can increase the power of your aberrant spells at the risk of your own vitality. When you cast a spell with your aberrant mark, you can use one of your Hit Die to increase the spell's level by 1. Immediately after you cast the spell, roll the Hit Die. You take damage equal to the number rolled.


## Acrobat
You become more nimble, gaining the following benefits:

* Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.
* As a bonus action, you can make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you succeed, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement until the end of the current turn.


## Actor
Skilled at mimicry and dramatics, you gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You have an advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person.
* You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.


## Adept of the Mage School
*Prerequisite: 4th Level, [Arcanist feat](#arcanist), member of [a mage school](../Organizations/MageSchools/index.md)*

Your ambition and loyalty to the school has been recognized, granting you these benefits:

* **Heightened Magic.** You learn one 2nd-level spell of your choice. The 2nd-level spell must be from the spells available to your school. You can cast this feat's 2nd-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
* One of the following abilities, depending on the school; note the GM may add/edit this list:

    * **Life Channel.** You can channel your lifeforce into the power of your magic. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you fails on a saving throw against a spell you cast, you can expend a number of Hit Dice equal to the level of the spell. Roll a number of Hit Die equal to half the number of Hit Dice expended (rounded up) and the damage the triggering creature takes increases by an amount equal to the total rolled of those dice.
    * **Magical Balance.** When you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, and roll a 9 or lower on the d20, you can use your reaction to balance fate and treat the roll as a 10. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
    * **Protective Ward.** When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend a spell slot and weave protective magic around the target. Roll a number of d4s equal to the level of the spell slot expended and reduce the damage the target takes by the total rolled on those dice + your spellcasting ability modifier.


## Aerial Mounted Combatant
You have learned how to ride a flying mount during both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. This means you are a dangerous foe to face while mounted. While you are mounted and aren't incapacitated, you gain the following benefits:

* You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount. You also have advantage on any ground-bound creature while you are in flight.
* You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.
* If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

This feat may be a prerequisite for other aerial combat feats.


## Agent of Order
*Prerequisite: 4th Level, [Scion of the Outer Planes (Lawful Outer Plane) Feat](#scion-of-the-outer-planes)*

* **Stasis Strike**. Once per turn when you damage a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can deal an extra 1d8 force damage to the target, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the ability score increased by this feat) or be restrained by spectral bindings until the start of your next turn. These bindings manifest as chains, gears, encasing stone, or some other symbol of stasis. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

* You gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If you are already proficient with them, you double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with them.
* As an action, you can identify one potion within 5 feet of you, as if you had tasted it. You must see the liquid for this benefit to work.
* Over the course of any short rest, you can temporarily improve the potency of one potion of healing of any rarity. To use this benefit, you must have alchemist's supplies with you, and the potion must be within reach. If the potion is drunk no more than 1 hour after the short rest ends, the creature drinking the potion can forgo the potion's die roll and regains the maximum number of hit points that the potion can restore.

* You learn one cantrip of your choice from the artificer spell list, and you learn one 1st-level spell of your choice from that list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. Whenever you gain a level, you can replace one of these spells with another spell of the same level from the artificer spell list.
* You can cast this feat's 1st-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.

## Baleful Scion

You gain a bonus to one damage roll of the spell equal to the number rolled. This bonus applies to one creature of your choice that you can see damaged by the spell; you can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
* **Card Tricks.** You learn the [prestidigitation](../Magic/Spells/prestidigitation.md) cantrip and can use it to create illusions that duplicate the effects of stage magic. When you use [prestidigitation](../Magic/Spells/prestidigitation.md) in this way, you can conceal the verbal and somatic components of the spell as mundane conversation and card-handling.
* **Hidden Ace.** When you finish a long rest, you can choose one spell you know and imbue it into a card; the chosen spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and its level must be less than or equal to your proficiency bonus. While the card is imbued with the spell, you can use your bonus action to flourish the card and cast the spell within. The card then immediately loses its magic.


## Channeler
You are one of the rare people who have the innate talent to control raw magic and express it in raw, fiery form.

This grants the following benefits:

* If you already have channeling dice, you gain one more; otherwise, you have two channeling dice, which are d6's. These channeling dice are used to fuel the uses described below. A channeling die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended channeling dice when you finish a long rest. If you are in an area where spells are suppressed or cannot be cast (such as an antimagic field spell), you cannot use channeling dice. You can only spend 1 channeling die per turn.
* When you take cold damage or damage from a spell, you can use your reaction to expend 1 or more channeling dice and regain hit points equal to the total number rolled on your channeling dice.
* Whenever you inflict fire damage with a spell or cantrip, you can use your bonus action to expend 1 or more channeling dice to inflict extra damage against one target of that fire damage (even if that target took no fire damage due to immunity or a similar effect). The target takes force damage equal to your total channeling dice roll, and you can push the target up to 10 feet away from you.
* As an action, you can expend 1 channeling die to cast [detect magic](../Magic/Spells/detect-magic.md).
* Whenever you spend 1 or more channeling dice, you shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you spend 4 or more channeling dice at once, these radii are doubled.
* As long as you have at least one unexpended channeling die remaining, you are considered naturally adapted to cold climates, and you have the ability to start fires with a touch. As an action, you can magically ignite a flammable object you touch with your hand--an object such as a torch, a piece of tinder, or the hem of drapes.
* You learn the [produce flame](../Magic/Spells/produce-flame.md) cantrip.


## Charger
When you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make one melee weapon attack or to shove a creature. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack's damage roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and you succeed).

* Increase your Constitution or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency with cook's utensils if you don't already have it.
* As part of a short rest, you can cook special food, provided you have ingredients and cook's utensils on hand. You can prepare enough of this food for a number of creatures equal to 4 + your proficiency bonus. At the end of the short rest, any creature who eats the food and spends one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points regains an extra 1d8 hit points.
* With one hour of work or when you finish a long rest, you can cook a number of treats equal to your proficiency bonus. These special treats last 8 hours after being made. A creature can use a bonus action to eat one of those treats to gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.


## Cohort of Chaos
*Prerequisite: 4th Level, [Scion of the Outer Planes (Chaotic Outer Plane) Feat](#scion-of-the-outer-planes)*

You can channel the cosmic forces of chaos that drive the multiverse toward both freedom and disarray. Your actions are still yours to choose, but you gain these benefits:

* **Ability Score Increase**. Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* **Chaotic Flare**. When you roll a 1 or a 20 on an attack roll or a saving throw, the magic of chaos flows through you. Roll on the Chaotic Flares table to determine what happens. A flare lasts until the end of your next turn, and a new flare can't occur until after the first flare ends.

d4 | Flare
-- | -----
1  | **Disruption Field**. Waves of energy ripple in a 10-foot sphere centered on you. Every creature other than you that starts its turn in that area, or that moves into that area for the first time on a turn, takes 1d8 force damage.
2  | **Battle Fury**. A creature of your choice that you can see is filled with reckless fury. The creature has advantage on attack rolls and disadvantage on ability checks.
3  | **Unbound**. When you move, you can use some or all of your walking speed to teleport once, along with any equipment you're wearing or carrying, up to the distance used to an unoccupied space that you can see.
4  | **Wailing Winds**. Howling winds swirl around you in a 60-foot radius. You and any creature in that radius has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.

You can also forcibly release a chaotic flare as a bonus action, rolling on the table as normal to determine the effects. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


## Confusing Onslaught
*Prerequisites: Chaotic alignment, Gnoll*

The gnolls charge, howling wildly and their chaotic attack confuses their opponents.

The first time you charge in combat, creatures you target during that charge become flat-footed.


## Critter Friend
*Prerequisite: Gnome (forest)*

Your friendship with animals mystically deepens. You gain the following benefits:
* You gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. If you're already proficient in it, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with it.
* You learn the [speak with animals](../Magic/Spells/speak-with-animals.md) spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn the [animal friendship](../Magic/Spells/animal-friendship.md) spell, and you can cast it once with this feat, without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.


## Crossbow Expert
Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:

* You ignore the loading quality of crossbows with which you are proficient.
* Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
* When you use the Attack action and attack with a one handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a hand crossbow you are holding.


## Crusher

* Increase your Strength or Dexterity by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack that deals bludgeoning damage, you can move it 5 feet to an unoccupied space, provided the target is no more than one size larger than you.
* When you score a critical hit that deals bludgeoning damage to a creature, attack rolls against that creature are made with advantage until the end of your next turn.


## Defensive Duelist
*Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher*

When you are wielding a finesse weapon with which you are proficient and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.


## Deft Strike
*Prerequisite: proficiency in Perception or Investigation*

Given enough time, you can find weak points in an opponent's armor and exploit them. You can use an action to search for weak points in another creature's armor, natural or not. Make an Investigation check contested by the creature's Armor Class. If you succeed, your next attack ignores all armor bonuses that the creature has, and its effective AC against your attack becomes 10 + the creature's Dexterity
modifier.

You can only gain this benefit if you are wielding a weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage. If you are using a ranged weapon, the creature must be within 30 feet of you for you to gain this benefit.


## Destined
*Prerequisite: must have backstory elements and DM's approval to take this feat*

You are part of a tapestry of purpose beyond your reckoning, and you are destined for great things, not to be stymied by the whims of luck or karma. You know that you will leave a mark on the story that unfolds around you, and perhaps even on the world.

You gain the following benefits:

* You increase one ability score of your choice by 1.
* Choose two backgrounds that are different than the one you started with. You gain those backgrounds' features in addition to your original background feature. This does not grant you additional proficiencies or equipment.
* You have 3 destiny points. When you make an ability check and see the total but before you know the result of the check, you can spend 1 Destiny Point to change the number you rolled on the d20 to 15.

If you take this feat, decide with your DM how you met your dragon familiar. Why did she agree to accompany you? What are her bonds and flaws?

Eventually, the dragon's nature will require her to leave and seek her own fortune. This time may be years down the road, but it is inevitable. Worse, she might die in combat. When that time comes, discuss with your DM how to resolve this conflict of character.

You are one of these few, a spellscarred savant. You wear your scar as a badge of power and a fell warning to your foes. You have learned to harness the dark gift of your spellscar and channel its disrupting power. The erratic forces behind your spellscar are yours to command now.

Your mastery of your spellscar allows you to tap into raw magical energy, either to harm others with its sizzling power or invigorate your own body. As your power grows, you can wield the fury of this raw magic as easily as a warrior does a blade, calling down the untempered essence of magic gone mad to burn foes to ash. This grants you the following abilities:

* **Flamespeed.** You can use a bonus action to increase your speed by 10 feet until the end of your next turn. Blue flame momentarily licks the ground where your feet touch it. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
* **Larger than Life.** When you make a melee attack, you can increase that attack's reach by 5 feet. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
* **Sight of the Unseen.** As a bonus action, or as a reaction when light around you dims, you gain the ability to see in both dim light and darkness as if they were bright light, but only out to a range of 5 feet. You can only end this effect during your turn, but doing so does not require an action. However, if the space you are in is exposed to bright light while this effect is active, you suffer disadvantage on sight-based Wisdom (Perception) checks until the end of your next turn. While this effect is active, your eyes are backlit with a dancing blue flame.
* **Spellscarred Strike.** When you strike an enemy, you can lash out with a flicker of blue fire that passes through their flesh and removes something vital. As an action, you can make an unarmed strike against a target within 5 feet. You may use either your Strength modifier or your Dexterity modifier to modify the attack roll, but you do not add either ability modifier to damage. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage and 1d4 force damage. The next time the target makes an attack roll before the end of its next turn, it coughs up sickly blue-black blood, and must either accept disadvantage on that attack roll or take 1d8 necrotic damage. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until after the end of your next turn.


## Spell Sniper

* When you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll, the spell's range is doubled.

Your training in the ways of the Knights of Solamnia grants you these benefits:

* **Martial Training.** You gain proficiency with medium armor and martial weapons.
* **Defensive Rider.** You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off a mount.
* **Encouraging Rally.** When another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes a saving throw, you can use your reaction to inspire them. If the target can hear you and understand you, it gains advantage on the saving throw. Once you use this reaction, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.


## Stealthy
You know how best to hide. You gain the following benefits:
* Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency in the Stealth skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.

## Stench of Death
*Prerequisites: Gnoll*

Known to languish in piles of filth and carrion, gnolls sometimes reek of things worse than urine.

You exude a terrible scent as a 15-foot aura that nearly every other creature finds repulsive. All living creatures (except those with the stench aura ability) within the aura must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the gnoll's character level + Constitution modifier) or be sickened for 5 rounds. Creatures that succeed at the saving throw cannot be sickened by the same creature's stench aura for 24 hours. A [delay poison](../Magic/Spells/delay-poison.md) or [neutralize poison](../Magic/Spells/neutralize-poison.md) spell or similar effect removes the effect from the sickened creature. This is a poison effect.


## Strike of the Giants
You have absorbed primeval magic that gives you an echo of the might of giants. Choose one of the kinds of giants listed below. As a bonus action, you can call on the power of your giant magic to imbue your attacks with additional power. The next time you hit a target with a melee or thrown weapon attack within the next minute, the attack has an additional effect depending on the origin of your giant magic:

* **Hill Giant**. The target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
* **Stone Giant**. The target takes an extra 1d6 force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you in a straight line.
* **Frost Giant**. The target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.
* **Fire Giant**. The target takes an extra 1d8 fire damage.
* **Cloud Giant**. The target takes an extra 1d4 thunder damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or you become invisible to it until the start of your next turn.
* **Storm Giant**. The target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.

The saving throw DC for these effects equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Constitution modifier.

You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

* Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

If you already know this spell, its range increases by 30 feet when you cast it. Its spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
* As a bonus action, you can try to telekinetically shove one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, roll your Psionic Talent die, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat) or be moved toward you or away from you a number of feet equal to 5 times the number you rolled. A creature can willingly fail this save.


## Telepathic

You awaken the ability to mentally connect with others. You gain the following benefits:
* Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Your communication doesn't give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.
* If your Psionic Talent die is available, you can cast the [detect thoughts]() spell, requiring no components. When you start casting the spell, your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size. Your spellcasting ability for the spell is the ability increased by this feat.

If one of the bond dies, the other faces deep anguish, insanity, and often death.

Non-gnolls in 60' radius must make Will save DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha mod or become shaken for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per additional 5 rolled over the DC.

## Tracker
You have spent time hunting creatures and honed your skills, gaining the following benefits:

* Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You learn the [hunter's mark](../Magic/Spells/hunters-mark.md) spell. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again.

If used as part of a full attack action, the bite is considered a secondary attack and is made at your full base attack bonus -5, and it adds only half your Strength modifier to damage.

* You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.

## Weapon Master
You have practiced extensively with a variety of weapons, gaining the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency with four weapons of your choice. Each one must be a simple or a martial weapon.


## Wild Talent
You awaken to your psionic potential, which enhances your mind or body. Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20, to represent this enhancement.

You also harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of which is a d6.

You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways:

* **Psi-Boosted Ability**. When you make an ability check with the ability increased by this feat, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check. You can choose to do so before or after rolling the d20, but before you know whether the check succeeded or failed.
* **Psi-Guided Strike**. Once on each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll that uses the ability increased by this feat, you can roll your Psionic Talent die after you make the damage roll and then replace one of the damage dice with the number rolled on the Psionic Talent die.

***Changing the Die's Size.*** If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example, if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it's a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest.

Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6.
Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

If you have a Psionic Talent die from another source, such as a class feature, you don't get more than one die; use only the one with the largest starting size.

***Psi Replenishment.*** As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can't use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long rest.


## Wintry Breath
*Prerequisites: Winter gnoll, Con 13+*

## Wonder Maker
*Prerequisite: Gnome (rock)*

* When you make a device with your Tinker trait, you have the following additional options for what you make:

  * **Lifter**: This device can be used as a block and tackle, allowing its user to hoist five times the weight the user can normally lift.
  * **Timekeeper**: This pocket watch keeps accurate time.

You also learn the [longstrider](../Magic/Spells/longstrider.md) and [pass without trace](../Magic/Spells/pass-without-trace.md) spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
