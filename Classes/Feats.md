# Feats
These feats, unless noted, are available to any character race or class. Any prerequisites must be met before the feat can be taken, however.

## Aberrant [Dragonmark](/Races/Dragonmarked.md)
*Prerequisite: No existing dragonmark.*

The twelve original dragonmarks, passed down from the Eldar through countless generations, have prven to be reliable and predictable, and their powers are constructive. They create; they heal; they protect.

But there is another kind of dragonmark: marks that are unpredictable and dangerous to both the bearer and the people around them. Someone with such a mark can kill with a touch or control minds with a glance. Aberrant marks often appear when people from different dragonmarked families produce a child, and for this reason such unions are absolutely forbidden by the Twelve. But aberrant dragonmarks can appear on members of any race, at any age, regardless of bloodline. No two aberrant dragonmarks are exactly alike; even if they grant the same power, they may appear and manifest in different ways. If two aberrant marks might grant fire bolt, one mark may be formed from scar tissue while another is traced on the skin in lines of cold fire.

You have manifested such an aberrant dragonmark. Determine its appearance and the flaw associated with it.

While aberrant dragonmarks can be disturbing, on the surface an aberrant mark seems no more dangerous or threatening than the powers of a sorcerer. So, what makes them significant? Aberrant marks always have flaws. These may not actively hurt a character, but they are always a burden in some way—-a burden that could drive a weak-willed person to madness. If you develop an aberrant mark, you can choose a flaw from this list, or you and the DM can develop a unique flaw of your own.

**Aberrant Mark Flaw**

*Prerequisite*: Psionic Talent feature or Wild Talent feat

You awaken the ability to mentally connect with others. You gain the following benefits:
* Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Your communication doesn’t give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.
* If your Psionic Talent die is available, you can cast the detect thoughts spell, requiring no components. When you start casting the spell, your Psionic Talent die decreases by one die size. Your spellcasting ability for the spell is the ability increased by this feat.

## Theologian
Your extensive study of religion rewards you with the following benefits:
* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency in the Religion skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.
* You learn the [thaumaturgy]() and [detect evil and good]() spells. You can cast [detect evil and good]() once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

## Tough
Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice your level when you gain this feat. Whenever you gain a level thereafter, your hit point maximum increases by an additional 2 hit points

## Tower of Iron Will
*Prerequisite*: Psionic Talent feature or Wild Talent feat

Your mind’s defenses are formidable. After you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the saving throw, potentially causing it to succeed.

## War Caster
*Prerequisite: The ability to cast at at least one spell*

You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:
* You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage.
* You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands.
* When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.

## Weapon Master
You have practiced extensively with a variety of weapons, gaining the following benefits:
* Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency with four weapons of your choice. Each one must be a simple or a martial weapon.

## Wild Talent
You awaken to your psionic potential, which enhances your mind or body. Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20, to represent this enhancement.

You also harbor a wellspring of psionic power within yourself, an energy that ebbs and flows as you channel it in various ways. This power is represented by your Psionic Talent die, the starting size of which is a d6.

***Psionic Talent Options***. You can use your Psionic Talent die in the following ways:
* **Psi-Boosted Ability**. When you make an ability check with the ability increased by this feat, you can roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the check. You can choose to do so before or after rolling the d20, but before you know whether the check succeeded or failed.
* **Psi-Guided Strike**. Once on each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll that uses the ability increased by this feat, you can roll your Psionic Talent die after you make the damage roll and then replace one of the damage dice with the number rolled on the Psionic Talent die.

***Changing the Die’s Size***. If you roll the highest number on your Psionic Talent die, it decreases by one die size after the roll. This represents you burning through your psionic energy. For example, if the die is a d6 and you roll a 6, it becomes a d4. If it’s a d4 and you roll a 4, it becomes unusable until you finish a long rest.

Conversely, if you roll a 1 on your Psionic Talent die, it increases by one die size after the roll, up to its starting size. This represents you conserving psionic energy for later use. For example, if you roll a 1 on a d4, the die then becomes a d6.
Whenever you finish a long rest, your Psionic Talent die resets to its starting size. When you reach certain levels, the starting size of your Psionic Talent die increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

If you have a Psionic Talent die from another source, such as a class feature, you don’t get more than one die; use only the one with the largest starting size.

***Psi Replenishment***. As a bonus action, you can calm your mind for a moment and restore your Psionic Talent die to its starting size. You then can’t use Psi Replenishment again until you finish a long rest.
