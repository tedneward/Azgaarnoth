# Deathless Axiom: Elegy of Revenge
Those who are drawn to the elegy of revenge have been all but consumed by a tragedy in their life and find solidarity in devoting their research interests to revenants. Driven by vengeance to right how they were wronged, these pale masters are relentless in their pursuit of delivering punishment, going so far as to return to walk among the living if they die before their retribution has been inflicted.

## Undead Graft: Skin of the Damned
Beginning when you select this elegy at 3rd level, you flay the skin from your body and replace it with the unkempt fleshy remains of an undead creature.

Some of the qualities possessed by your graft's previous owner are intrinsically bestowed on to you. You gain proficiency with martial weapons, medium armor, and shields. Additionally, you learn how to craft scourged weapons.

## Scourged Weapon
Starting at 3rd level when you choose this elegy, you can bind yourself to a weapon and use it to channel your unending thirst for vengeance.

You perform a ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest, over which time you stitch or encase undead skin onto a melee weapon or your choice (such as replacing the leather on a sword's hilt with flesh), and infuse it with necromantic magic. This weapon serves as a spellcasting focus for your pale master spells. 

The primary source of damage dealt by the weapon becomes necrotic damage and you can use your Strength or Intelligence modifier for the attack and damage rolls when attacking with it. Any unique properties the weapon possesses (such a +1 bonus) are retained by the weapon. 

If the weapon is lost or destroyed, you can perform the ritual again on a new weapon. You gain the ability to have two scourged weapons at 12th level and three scoured weapons at 17th level.

## Vengeful Touch
Starting at 6th level, when you hit a creature with an attack from a scourged weapon, it can cause great trepidation. The target takes an additional 2d8 necrotic damage must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed until you deal damage to it, or until the end of your next turn.

When the paralysis ends, the target becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see you, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.

You can use this feature once per long rest at 6th level. You gain an additional use at 12th level and again at 17th level.

Expended uses are regained when you finish a long rest.

## Strength in Death
Starting at 6th level, you can cast the feign death spell using one of your spell slots, but it does not count towards your number of prepared spells. When you cast feign death, the willing creature has immunity to all damage except psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is diseased or poisoned when you cast the spell, these effects are cured.

## Create Wight
At 10th level, you are able to taint the remains of a recently slain creature. You choose the corpse of a creature that has died in the last 24 hours and grant it a semblance of life that is fed by your violence and hatred, raising as a wight under your control.

The wight turns to ash when it drops to 0 hit points or when 1-hour passes. The wight is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the wight, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the wight, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The DM has the wight's statistics.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Loathsome Rebirth
Starting at 14th level, if the you are killed, your soul lingers. After 24 hours, your soul inhabits and animates another humanoid corpse on the same plane of existence (picked by the DM). You retain all of your character's statistics in your new form, but none of your old gear unless you retrieve it from the corpse of your previous body.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you inhabit your most recent form for at least 10 days. If you die before 10 days pass, your soul passes into the afterlife.
