# Deathless Axiom: Elegy of Enduring
The pursuit of immortality is what drives pale masters to enter into this elegy, as they are fascinated with the gifts possessed by liches. While missing much of the prowess of their undead idols, these pale masters are only just beginning their quest. Perhaps through greater devotion, one day it may be possible for an enduring pale master to ascend completely...

## Undead Graft: Skeletal Arm
Beginning when you select this elegy at 3rd level, you remove your arm and replace it with a skeletal appendage. 

Your undead graft becomes a spellcasting focus for your magic, allowing you to cast spells with it and perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands. Additionally, you may attack with your graft as if it were a simple weapon with which you are proficient. To do so, you make a melee spell attack against a creature, dealing 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit.

At 6th level, your graft gains a +1 bonus to melee attacks and damage rolls. This increases to a +2 bonus at 12th level and a +3 bonus at 17th level.

## Practised Spellcaster
Your study of the dark arts expands your spellcasting prowess beyond other pale masters.

At 3rd level, you are able to select 2 additional cantrips from the pale master spell list, which don't count against your number of Cantrips Known. You can change these cantrips when you gain a new pale master level.

## Paralyzing Touch
Starting at 6th level, when you hit a creature with a melee spell attack from your undead graft, you can instill rigor mortis. The target takes an additional 2d8 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become paralysed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

You can use this feature once per long rest at 6th level. You gain an additional use at 12th level and again at 17th level. Expended uses are regained when you finish a long rest.

## Invigorate the Dead
Starting at 6th level, you can cast the animate dead spell using one of your spell slots, but it does not count towards your number of prepared spells. When you cast animate dead, each skeleton or zombie animated has its maximum number of hit points. Additionally, each undead created with this spell adds your spellcasting modifier to its attack and damage rolls.

## Undead Cohort: Flameskull
At 10th level, you are able to taint the remains of a recently slain creature. You choose the corpse of a creature that died in the last 24 hour and instill the foul mimicry of life, animating its head as a flameskull under your control. 

The flameskull turns to ash when it drops to 0 hit points or when 1-hour passes. The flameskull is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the flameskull, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you).

If you don’t issue any commands to the flameskull, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The DM has the flameskull’s statistics.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Deathless Vigor
Your research of liches has taught you how to make a rudimentary phylactery, which serves as the pinnacle of your obsession with immortality.

At 14th level, you bind a small part of your soul to an object of your choosing, which serves as your phylactery. Upon death, you gain a new body in 1d10 days that appears within 5 feet of your phylactery. Your new form looks similar to your old one.

While working in a similar manner to a lich's phylactery, the one you create with your deathless vigor feature does not possess the same power and is destroyed when used upon your death. You are able to create another rudimentary phylactery but must spend 10 days and 5,000 gp to do so. You can only bind yourself to one rudimentary phylactery at a time.
