# Sacred Oath: Oath of the Stalker
The Oath of the Stalker is that of the paladin that metes out justice to those that deserve it. 

## Tenets of the Stalker
* **Let no Foe Escape.** I will pursue my foe to the ends of the earth, no matter how long it takes to track down my enemy, I will.
* **Responsible for my Hunt.** If my foe harms anyone in their path while beeing stalked, I am responsible, and must do what I can to make amends to those affected.
* **Relentless Pursuit.** I will not let anyone stand in my way of my, or relent to neither authority nor kin in the pursuit of my foe.
* **Tempered with Wisdom.** I will not pursue my foe foolheartedly and always be aware that of other foes or ambushes along my path. I acknowledge and believe that not every foe is in need of killing.
