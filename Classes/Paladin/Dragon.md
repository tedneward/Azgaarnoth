# Paladin Sacred Oath: Oath of the Dragon
The Oath of the Dragon sets a paladin on a path of patient warfare. Their long lives give them time to set plans in motion that take decades or centuries to complete, always against the other side of the eternal war; when dealing with dragons, it is impossible to keep from taking a side.

The [Draconic Order](Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md) is, in many respects, the pinnacle of the Oath of the Dragon, but not all paladins within the Order swear their oaths to the dragons, nor are all Dragonsworn paladins a part of the Order; some will swear to a dragon or powerful entity within the [Cult of the Wrym](/Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md), and some will swear to the even more sinister [Cult of the Nightwyrm](/Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md).

Regardless of the color of the dragon's scales, paladins swearing this Oath are powerful beings deserving of respect and, like their namesake, a little awe.

## Tenets of the Dragon
A paladin who undertakes this oath usually does so under the supervision and guidance of a powerful dragon or figure allied to the dragons, whom the paladin chooses to serve, though it is possible to take this oath simply by devoting oneself to the cause and the draconic ideals. Even if you don't serve a particular dragon or type of dragon, choose a type of dragon to emulate from the Dragon Type table. This choice will effect the abilities you obtain later in this class.

***Accumulate Wealth***. It is your duty to accumulate wealth, whatever form that might take. Save what you gain, keep it somewhere safe, and do not part with it without good cause. (The Order uses this wealth to effect change all across Azgaarnoth, and Cultists use this wealth to further their ends.)

***Elimination***. You play a crucial part in the eternal war between metallic and chromatic dragons. When you can, you must take any opportunity to destroy or weaken any dragon who would oppose you or your beliefs. It is your responsibility to ensure that dragons of your alignment are cared for and protected. Protect those who cannot defend themselves, and pledge loyalty to older dragons.

***Perspective***. Dragons live for centuries or millennia. Their plans take time to execute; often humanoids forget this, and look at the short-term rewards rather than the long-term. Maintain a long-term perspective.

***Reverence***. Dragons are the pinnacle of creation and they should be treated as such. Correct those who fail to see this, and commend those who do.

## Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Dragon Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.
**Oath of the Dragon Spells**
Paladin Level|Spells
-------------|------
3rd|absorb elements, chromatic orb
5th|earthbind, locate object
9th|elemental weapon, fear
13th|elemental bane, leomund's secret chest
17th|hold monster, geas

## Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options:
* **Dragon's Breath**. You can use your Channel Divinity to manifest the breath weapon of a dragon. The area and damage type of the breath are determined by the dragon type you chose when you took this oath. Each creature in that area must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by the dragon type. A creature takes damage equal to 2d10 + your paladin level on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. If you already have a breath weapon, the damage dice of your breath increases to d12 when you use this Channel Divinity option.
* **Frightful Presence**. You can use your Channel Divinity to suddenly appear frightening to your enemies. All creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you. A frightened creature can attempt the saving throw again at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Draconic Smite
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the ability to infuse your strikes with elemental power. When you use your Divine Smite ability, you can choose to deal a damage type other than radiant, determined by the dragon type you chose on the Dragon Type table.

When you reach 11th level, you can change the damage type of your Improved Divine Smite ability in the same fashion.

**Dragon Type**
Dragon Type|Damage Type
-----------|-----------
Black|acid
Blue|lightning
Brass|fire
Bronze|lightning
Copper|acid
Gold|fire
Green|poison
Red|fire
Silver|cold
White|cold

## Aura of Resistance
When you reach 7th level, you exude an aura of draconic power. You and all of your allies within 10 feet of you have resistance to the damage type specified by the Dragon Type table, according to the type you chose when you first took this oath. When you reach 18th level, the range of this aura extends to 30 feet.

## Draconic Immunity
When you reach 15th level, you gain immunity to the damage type given by your Draconic Type. In addition, your aging slows to a nearly imperceptible crawl. For every decade that passes, you age only 1 year.

## Dragon Aspect
When you reach 20th level, you gain the ability to take on the appearance of a mighty dragon. When you do this, you gain the following benefits for the next hour:
* Magical draconic wings sprout from your back, granting you a flying speed of 60 feet.
* Magical horns or spines sprout on your head and your eyes glow with draconic power. You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
* You can use your Dragon's Breath Channel Divinity option without expending a use of Channel Divinity. Instead, after using your Dragon's Breath, roll a d6 at the beginning of each of your turns. On a roll of 5 or 6, your Dragon's Breath recharges and you can use it again.
