# Sacred Oath: Oath of Shadows
The Oath of Shadows is a secretive code, sworn by those paladins who realize that they cannot do what they must by the light of day. They take to the night and shadows, cloaking themselves in power drawn from the shadowfell turning the darkness against their foes. Some are selfish blackguards seeking personal wealth, while others are vigilante heroes seeking to root out evil that is normally shielded by the law.

It is rumored that the [Order of the Copper Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Copper.md) has a branch buried deep within it that are Shadow Paladins sworn to this Oath, but the Coppers vehemently deny any such rumor. It is believed almost beyond a doubt that the [Dread Emperor](/People/DreadEmperor.md) has those within his service sworn to the Shadows, and some posit that his personal bodyguards, the Dread Guard, are all Shadow Paladins.

## Tenets of Shadows
Each paladin who swears to the Oath of Shadows decides for themselves what is truly right and wrong, and though they range from good to evil they are rarely lawful. Still they share certain tenets about how to enact their morality on the world.

**Cast a Great Shadow.** You know that just as a shadow can loom much larger than its source, the idea of you can be far more terrifying than you yourself. Use any dramatic flourish, imposing costume, or mysterious tactic you can to leave your foes telling fearful tales of you long after you have left them. The shadow you cast over your foes is your greatest weapon.

**Shades of Gray.** No one is perfectly good or evil. There is no moral black and white, only shades of gray. Even those with the best intentions can commit evil and even those who seem irredeemable can still change for the better. One should not slay the wicked in thoughtless haste, for they may not be so wicked forever, and the slayer may not be so righteous.

**Remain Cowled.** The night and shadow are your cloak and cowl guarding you from those who would stymie your efforts out of a misguided hunger for transparency and "truth." But darkness and deception are not inherently good or bad- they are tools that can be used for any cause. Stay within the safety of the darkness, and always keep your true nature private and hidden except from your most trusted allies.

**Do What Must Be Done.** Laws, norms, and rules have a purpose and a place, but you belong outside that place. You must do what you believe is correct in the privacy of your heart, even if it means being a vigilante, pariah, or criminal.
