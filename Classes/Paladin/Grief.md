# Sacred Oath: Oath of Grief
The Oath of Grief shuns false hope and seeks to remind the world of the hollow joke of its existence, its purposelessness, its futility, and its tragic horror. Life may seem good at times, but the only constant is that it will get worse. Comforting lies like love or a greater meaning to one's life which hide the true horror and madness of the world only teach people to swim against the vicious tide of life and drown. Only by accepting the cruel hand we are given can those of the Oath of Grief find the path to what meager existence can be tolerated.

## Tenets of Grief
The brutal realities that the Oath of Grief hold as tenets may be painfuL but they are better to accept than to deny.

**Expect the Worst.** Surviving is about minimizing pain, not finding happiness. Always expect to suffer and faiL and you'll never be disappointed Remind others of this inevitable truth.

**Beware Everyone.** Trust is fleeting, false, and foolish.  Never forget that everyone lies to themselves, and that you could be betrayed by anyone, especially at their lowest point.

**Let Go of Your Mind.** The quest to maintain one's sanity is a futile effort. Embrace the dynamic nature of your mind and accept that you will never truly understand your own depths.

**Reject False Hope.** Just as those thrown high into the air will suffer a steep falL those sent high by hope will inevitably crash down all the more hard when the cold reality hits them. Deny hope in yourself and others. Stay safely on the ground.

**Life Has No Meaning.** Do not believe in such silly lies.
