# Sacred Oath: Oath of Inquisition
Those who uphold the Oath of Inquisition are warriors of strict ideals and little compromise. Resolute in their vision of how the world should be, they root out dissent and remove opposition to their cause wherever they find it. Though many Inquisitors work for the greater good, and for evil, the line between those two absolutes can become very blurry when hard choices need to be made.

## Tenets of Inquisition

* **Duty.** We all have a responsibility to help make the world how it should be. I can show you the true way.
* **Fortitude.** I have faith in my beliefs, and nothing can shake my confidence that I am right.
* **Tenacity.** To retreat today might be a necessary evil, but I will return with tenfold might to destroy the what I have seen here.
* **Purity.** The wrong kinds of people cannot be tolerated. They will see things my way, or they will be excised.
