<h1 id="shaman">Shaman</h1>
<p>Speaking words that cause the fire before her to roar upwards with sudden life, a tall human woman thrusts an intricate wooden carving into the flames. Though her hand remains whole, the carving she holds burns to ash that slips between her fingers.</p>
<p>After examining a child that will not wake, a wizened dwarf leans back in his chair and falls asleep. After a few minutes, the dwarf awakens, along with the child.</p>
<p>Roaring the name of an ancient warrior, a female halforc charges forward, swinging a mace that glows with an eerie, spectral light.</p>
<p>Shamans serve as intermediaries between the mortal world and the realms of spirits, called by the spirits to speak for them among mortals. These spirits come in a variety of forms, ranging from elemental nature spirits to the souls of fallen ancestors, and often take on animalistic shapes. While most shamans revere the spirits for which they speak, they rarely worship them outright. More often, a shaman negotiates with the spirits, being granted power both as a means to fulfill the spirits' needs and as a reward for doing so.</p>
<p>Shamans are often the connection to the spirit realm for those who eschew or ignore the divine; as such, shamans are frequently found in <a href="../../Nations/Yithi/">Yithi</a> and <a href="../../Nations/Zhi/">Zhi</a>, including on the Council of Seers. The spirit world also seems to prefer those who live away from urban environments, such as in <a href="../../Nations/Bedia/">North Bedia</a> or in the <a href="/Geography/Ravenlands.md">Ravenslands</a>, but shamans have been called from within the slums of <a href="/Cities/Mighal.md">Mighal</a>, so clearly civilization is no barrier to the spirits. Many of the <a href="/Geography/AlUma.md"><em>al'maera</em></a> find themselves called as Speakers of Winds or Waters</p>
<h2 id="speakers-for-spirits">Speakers for Spirits</h2>
<p>Though a shaman usually awakens in response to a specific spirit's call, she is thereafter bound to the type of spirit that called her, not the individual spirit itself. As such, relationships between a shaman and the various spirits she encounters tend to be less absolute in their tone than that between a cleric and his god or a warlock and his patron. A shaman traveling to a new land must acquaint herself with entirely new spirits and persuade them to grant her some of their power. While holding to the spirits' obeisances is the easiest way to make these negotiations run smoothly, some spirits may require that a shaman perform some task with the power that they provide.</p>
<p>The powers bestowed upon a shaman by the spirits can range from minor alterations to her being (such as an extended lifespan or ability to understand languages) to ancient, powerful forms of magic. Some shamans are gifted with spiritual strength that allows them to fight as warriors of the spirits for which they speak, while others gain insight into the future and hidden truths of the world. While many of the spells available to a shaman are determined by her calling, all shamans share an understanding of certain forms of natural magic.</p>
<h2 id="heed-the-call">Heed the Call</h2>
<p>Though many may pay homage to spirits in their daily lives, the spiritual center of a community is not necessarily a shaman. It takes more than an understanding of rituals and traditions to truly speak for the spirits, and those best capable of serving a mortal community are no more likely to be called by the spirits than anyone else. Instead, it is more common for such individuals to be the ones to whom a shaman speaks, representing the spiritual needs of the mortals in the same way that the shaman represents the desires and needs of the spirits.</p>
<p>While a paladin or warlock makes a conscious decision to swear himself to greater powers, one cannot simply choose to walk the path of a shaman. That choice belongs as much to the spirits as to the shaman herself, and there is no set pattern that spirits follow as a whole. Individual spirits, however, may show some consistency in their selections, such as always calling members of a specific bloodline or those who have completed a series of trials. Other spirits can be unpredictable, calling shamans seemingly at random or according to some unknown, inscrutable purpose. Sometimes, spirits that have previously shown great consistency in their selections may call a shaman that breaks their usual conventions, usually in response to unusual or changing circumstances.</p>
<p>Every shaman experiences the call differently. One might suddenly possess memories of people and events long since past, or begin to hear voices in the wind. The shaman may find herself speaking with bizarre creatures in her dreams, or suddenly understanding the leaps and crackles of flames as though they were a language of their own. Initially, the signs of the call are subtle, growing stronger as time passes until the shaman finally makes contact with the spirits that have called her and agrees to speak for them.</p>
<p>Once a shaman has answered the call, she is forever marked as a speaker of the type of spirit that called her, and can call upon and be called by any such spirits. While the individual spirit that first issued the call may have a specific task in mind for the shaman, she is under no obligation to serve that spirit's interests, and can negotiate her terms or seek other spirits of the same type to grant her power. Deals between spirits and shamans are most often temporary arrangements, though shamans that are attached to a single location will often negotiate with the local spirits to receive power constantly in exchange for regular service. Many shamans, however, feel more loyalty to the type of spirit they speak for than any individual spirit, and may wander in search of spirits that need their aid. Others may find themselves sent to strange lands on quests given to them by spirits with unusual needs. Spirits will usually grant power to these wandering shamans even if they do not currently require a speaker, understanding that they may someday have to rely on the good will of a wanderer.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-shaman">Creating a Shaman</h2>
<p>As you create a shaman, the most important question to consider is the type of spirit to which your character is called and which of the obeisances your character is closest to. You should also think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Did you come from a land where shamanic ways are common, perhaps receiving training from an elder shaman? Or were you raised in a region that had forgotten the ways of shamanism, making you an oddity in the area of the campaign? Do you take your spiritual responsibilities seriously, viewing your interactions with the spirit and mortal worlds as an important part of who you are? Or do you consider spirits to be little more than a convenient avenue to power?</p>
<p>How did you experience your call to serve as a shaman? Did you suffer a traumatic event, after which the fire spoke to you of its healing power? Did another shaman help you interpret the visions that you had been having and decide to train you? Or did you simply gain a slow understanding of the world around you, culminating in the realization that every part of the world had a spirit, and that you could commune with them? </p>
<p>Once you've chosen a calling and settled on the experience of being called, consider your shaman's relationship to the spirits she speaks for and work with your DM to determine how big a part your calling will play in your adventuring career. The requests of the spirits you encounter might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures. Since you will probably deal with a multitude of different spirits in the course of your adventures, it may well be the case that some spirits will ask only minor tasks of you, while others may send you on larger quests.</p>

<h2 id="shamanic-calling">Shamanic Calling</h2>
<p><em>1st-level shaman feature</em></p>
<p>At 1st level, you have felt the call of the spirits guiding you towards a shamanic path. You have become a <a href="/Classes/Shaman/Ancestors.md">Speaker of the Ancestors</a>, a <a href="/Classes/Shaman/Dreams.md">Speaker of Dreams</a>, a <a href="/Classes/Shaman/Flames.md">Speaker of Flames</a>, a <a href="/Classes/Shaman/Stones.md">Speaker of Stones</a>, a <a href="/Classes/Shaman/Waters.md">Speaker of Waters</a>, or a <a href="/Classes/Shaman/Winds.md">Speaker of Winds</a>. Your choice grants you calling spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level, and additional benefits at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>
<p>The spirits that call shamans are not extraplanar beings, but local, worldly spirits. However, unlike a warlock, a shaman is not bound to a single entity. While she may initially work with one specific spirit, once she has accepted the call, she will likely meet and deal with many different spirits of her calling.</p>
<p>All spirits, even those that commune with shamans of the same calling, are very different beings, and a shaman will encounter a variety of different attitudes as she pursues her calling. Shamans of the same calling may bring news to one another of particularly notable spirits, or may issue warnings against dealing with more capricious or malicious ones.</p>
<p>Some shamans prefer to commune with and draw power from a specific spirit or group of spirits, rather than calling upon local spirits. By carrying a talisman or token from a spirit--a branch burned by the flames of a specific fire spirit, the bone from the body of a specific ancestral spirit's body, and so on--a shaman can commune with that spirit from a distance, allowing her to call upon its power even in strange lands.</p>
<h3 id="obeisance">Obeisance</h3>
<p>Every shamanic calling has several obeisances through which a shaman can honor the spirits for which she speaks. A shaman who has heard the call of the spirits usually already displays the values associated with at least one of that calling's obeisances, or else has some hidden potential that the spirits are aware of.</p>
<p>While spirits can be fickle, they are rarely strict. A shaman need not act in accordance with all of the obeisances of her calling in order to call upon the spirits. Many shamans only display the values of one or two of their calling's obeisances. However, a shaman whose actions and values stand in opposition to all of the obeisances of her calling may encounter difficulties in dealing with the spirits.</p>
<p>A shaman who stands against obeisance might have to spend a full night in communion with local spirits to gain their trust, or she might go on a vision quest, led by the spirits, in order to gain understanding of one of her calling's obeisances and accept it as a part of her. However, a shaman who stands against obeisance and, for whatever reason, does not want to work to gain the trust of spirits or accept one of her obeisances can also search for another option. As all spirits are different individuals, it is possible to find a spirit that does not adhere to the standards of the rest of its kind and does not require the usual obeisance. By carrying a talisman or token of such a spirit, a shaman that stands against obeisance can continue to wield spiritual power.</p>
<h3 id="calling-spells">Calling Spells</h3>
<p>Each shamanic calling has a list of spells--its calling spells--that you gain at the shaman levels noted in the calling description. Once you gain a calling spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
<p>If you have a calling spell that doesn't appear on the shaman spell list, the spell is nonetheless a shaman spell for you.</p>
<h2 id="spirit-magic">Spirit Magic</h2>
<p><em>1st-level shaman feature</em></p>
<p>Drawing on the power of spirits, as directed by your calling, you can cast spells to shape the world around you.</p>
<h3 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h3>
<p>You know one cantrip of your choice from the shaman spell list. You learn additional shaman cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Shaman table.</p>
<h3 id="spirit-points">Spirit Points</h3>
<p>Rather than spell slots, you use spirit points to cast your spells. These points represent your reservoir of spiritual energy. The Shaman table shows how many spirit points you have. To cast one of your shaman spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a number of spirit points equal to the level of the spell that you are casting. You can increase a spell's level in this way, but cannot exceed the level shown in the Maximum Spell Level column of the Shaman table. You regain all expended spirit points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have 5 spirit points. You can cast one 3rd-level spell and one 2ndlevel spell, two 2nd-level spells and one 1st-level spell, five 1st-level spells, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="preparing-spells">Preparing Spells</h3>
<p>You prepare the list of shaman spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the shaman spell list. When you do so, choose a number of shaman spells equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level equal to or lower than the level shown in the Maximum Spell Level column of the Shaman table.</p>
<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of shaman spells requires time spent in meditation and communion with spirits: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
<h3 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h3>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC of a shaman spell you cast and when making an attack.</p>
<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
<h3 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h3>
<p>You can use a spiritual totem as a spellcasting focus for your shaman spells.</p>

<h2 id="shamanic-invocations">Shamanic Invocations</h2>
<p><em>2nd-level shaman feature</em></p>
<p>In your dealings with spirits, you have been granted <a href="Invocations/">shamanic invocations</a>, fragments of ancient knowledge that imbue you with powerful abilities and magic. </p>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain one shamanic invocation of your choice. When you gain certain shaman levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Shaman table.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.</p>
<h2 id="spiritual-gift">Spiritual Gift</h2>
<p><em>3rd-level shaman feature</em></p>
<p>At 3rd level, the spirits to which you are called bestow a gift upon you as a mark of your calling. You gain one of the following features of your choice.</p>
<h3 id="gift-of-savagery">Gift of Savagery</h3>
<p>You can use your action to create a spirit weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the shape that this weapon takes each time you create it, from a wooden mace to a set of ghostly claws, but this shape only affects whether the weapon deals bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage. Regardless of its appearance, your spirit weapon is a melee weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage, and you are proficient in its use. This weapon does not have any weapon properties such as finesse or two-handed, but is treated as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. However, the weapon is not otherwise magical, and it can be targeted normally by spells like <a href="../../Magic/Spells/magic-weapon/">magic weapon</a> and <a href="../../Magic/Spells/elemental-weapon/">elemental weapon</a>.</p>
<p>Your spirit weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or you die.</p>
<h3 id="gift-of-sight">Gift of Sight</h3>
<p>When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.</p>
<p>Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.</p>
<h2 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h2>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h2 id="hidden-lore">Hidden Lore</h2>
<p>At 11th level, the spirits bestow upon you a piece of hidden lore. Choose one 6th-level spell from the shaman spell list as this hidden lore. You can cast your hidden lore spell once without expending spirit points. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
<p>At higher levels, you gain more shaman spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9thlevel spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Hidden Lore when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h2 id="timeless-body">Timeless Body</h2>
<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.</p>
<h2 id="spiritual-master">Spiritual Master</h2>
<p>At 20th level, you can entreat nearby spirits to aid you in dire circumstances as an action, calling upon them to grant you access to all the magic available to a shaman. For 1 minute, you can cast any spell of 5th level or lower from the shaman spell list as if you had prepared it.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p></div>
