# Warlock Patron: The Seeker
Your patron is an inscrutable being who travels the Astral Plane in search of knowledge and secrets. In return for your patron’s gifts, you wander the world seeking lore that you can share with the Seeker.

## Expanded Spell List
The Seeker lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

**Seeker Expanded Spells**
Spell Level | Spells
1st | feather fall, jump
2nd | levitate, locate object
3rd | clairvoyance, sending
4th | arcane eye, locate creature
5th | legend lore, passwall

## Shielding Aurora
Starting at 1st level, you can invoke the Seeker’s power to protect you from harm. As a bonus action, you create a whirling aurora of brilliant energy that swirls around you. Until the end of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage, and if a hostile creature ends its turn within 10 feet of you, it takes radiant damage equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier. 

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Pact Boon: Pact of the Star Chain
At 3rd level, a character dedicated to the Seeker can select this option instead of one of the warlock’s existing Pact Boon options.

The Seeker grants you a chain forged from starlight, decorated with seven gleaming motes of brightness. While  the chain is on your person, you know the [augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/augury) spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. 

Additionally, you can invoke the Seeker’s power to gain advantage on an Intelligence check while you carry this item. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

If you lose your Star Chain, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from the Seeker. The ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous chain. The chain disappears in a flash of light when you die.

The exact form of this item might be different depending on your patron.

## Astral Refuge
At 6th level, you gain the ability to step into an astral refuge. As an action, you disappear from the world for a brief moment and enter the Astral Plane, taking advantage of its timeless nature. While in your astral refuge, you can take two actions to cast spells that target only you. After using those two actions, you return to the space you occupied and your turn ends.

## Far Wanderer
At 10th level, you no longer need to breathe, and you gain resistance to fire damage and cold damage.

## Astral Sequestration
Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to sequester yourself and your allies on the Astral Plane. 

By performing a special ritual over the course of 5 minutes, you shift yourself and up to ten willing creatures you can see to the Astral Plane. You and those creatures gain the benefits of a short rest while sequestered on the Astral Plane. You then return to the spaces you all occupied when you used this ability, with no time having passed in the world.

During this short rest, you and the creatures you sequester can make use of any options available during a rest that affect only you and the creatures you sequester.

Once you use this ability, you  cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.
