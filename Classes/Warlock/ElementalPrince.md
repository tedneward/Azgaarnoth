# Otherworldly Patron: Elemental Prince
Your patron is a primordial spirit of elemental destruction, dedicated to one of the four elements that together comprise the building blocks of the material plane. The primal forces you command are often directed towards evil, but also hold the potential for acts of creation. Examples of patrons able to invest you with these powers include Olhydra, Imix, Yan-C-Bin and Orgremoch.

When you choose this subclass, pick Fire, Water, Earth or Air, depending on the nature of your patron. You may also choose a patron that exists at the intersection of the elements, such as Magma (Fire/Earth), Ice (Water/Air), Ooze (Water/Earth), or Ash (Fire/Air).

## Expanded Spell List
The Elemental Evil lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The Elemental Evil Expanded Spells table shows the spells that are added to the warlock spell list for you, depending on your patron's nature: fire, water, earth or air. Options are also provided for elementals hailing from the liminal planes of Ice, Magma, Ooze and Ash which form the borders between their larger cousins.

Earth | ***Unyielding.*** When you are subjected to an effect that would move you, knock you prone, or both, you can use your reaction to be neither moved nor knocked prone.
Fire  | ***Heated Body.*** A creature that touches you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you takes 5 (1d10) fire damage.
Water | ***Invisible in Water.*** You are invisible while fully immersed in water, or in heavy rain. Light rain turns you translucent and you are considered lightly obscured.
Air   | ***Windbreaker.*** If you would be hit with a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to cause the attack to miss.
