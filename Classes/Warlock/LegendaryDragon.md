# Warlock Patron: The Legendary Dragon
Your patron is a dragon of truly ancient origin, who has unlocked secrets of the multiverse still unknown to most of the cosmos. This dragon could be a gold wyrm who has watched over a kingdom for millenia, or perhaps he is a shadow dragon living in the Shadowfell, looking for ways to spread his corrupting influence. He could be a powerful dracolich that saw the dawn of the world, posing as a benevolent silver dragon.

Dragons are versatile creatures, and take a variety of forms; work with your DM to determine who your patron is and why they have chosen you (or accepted your request for power). How did you learn of their existence, or vice versa? The dragon's identity determines its motives, alignment, and ultimately how it treats you as your patron. Choose (or roll) on the list of possible Legendary Dragons below. If you have ideas for other Legendary Dragon patrons, ask your DM about them.

> ### Legendary Dragons
> Legendary Dragons as Patrons
> Generally, a Legendary Dragon needs to be at least of the Ancient age category, though it would be most desirable to have one as old as a Great Wyrm. 
> The Legendary Dragon Otherworldly Patron is unique because it openly offers (and encourages) the possibility of open interaction between warlock and patron (unless the patron is an extraplanar dragon, which obviously makes things a bit trickier). As a DM, carefully consider who this dragon is and why they are important. Also consider: what is the dragon getting out of this deal? Does the warlock owe her patron a share of earned treasure, and if so, what kind of treasure does that dragon prefer? Or is the warlock to find other domitable servants to further the dragon's ends?
> The Legendary Dragon also differs from most other patrons because dragons can feasibly be killed. What effect does this have on the warlock with whom the dragon shares its power? Is the dragon terrified of death and searching for a way to claim immortality? What happens to the warlock's power if/when the dragon dies?
> ***Dracoliches.*** Though a dracolich has forsaken its draconic nature for undeath, that doesn't mean it can't bestow its draconic abilities upon its followers. When determining which damage type the warlock uses, first determine the dracolich's original dragon type. This type determines the damage type, according to the Dragon Patron table.

## Expanded Spell List
The Legendary Dragon lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

**Legendary Dragon Expanded Spells**
Spell Level|Spells
-----------|------
1st|chromatic orb, command
2nd|locate object, see invisibility
3rd|elemental weapon, protection from energy
4th|compulsion, polymorph
5th|geas, legend lore

## Dragon Lore
When you make this pact at 1st level, you learn secrets told only among the dragon race. You can speak, read, and write Draconic, and you can add double your proficiency bonus to any Persuasion or Deception skill check made to interact with dragons, if you are already proficient in those skills.

In addition, you gain proficiency in one of the following: Arcana, Nature, History, or Religion. If you make an ability check with your chosen ability, and the information is draconic in nature, you may double your proficiency bonus.

## Dragon's Breath
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to manifest your patron's breath weapon. You can cast dragon's breath at the level of your highest spell slot without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can only cast it on yourself, and instead of choosing the damage type, the damage type is determined by the nature of your patron, as given in the Dragon Patron table.

Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Dragon's Resistance
When you reach 10th level, your patron bestows on you a portion of its resistant ability. You gain resistance to the damage type specified by the type of your Dragon Patron.

## Dragon's Presence
Starting at 14th level, you can channel the great and terrible presence of your patron. As an action, you can appear terrifying to your enemies, and you take on traits of your patron: horns, fiery eyes, spectral wings, a tail, or other like things. You exude a terrifying aura with a radius of 60 feet for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), for up to one minute. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the area or enters the area for the first time on its turn, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened of you until your concentration ends. At the end of each of its turns, it can attempt the save again. On a successful save, it can't be affected by your Dragon's Presence for the next 24 hours.

Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
