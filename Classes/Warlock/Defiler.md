# Otherworldly Patron: The Defiler
You have made a pact with a magical entity that defiles and corrupts. Your patron is a source of foul blight and toxicity, such as a hag coven, a powerful elder ooze, a yuan-ti archpriest, an archfiend of corruption, a noxious disease-spreading undead, or even a poisonous spirit of nature, such as a mysterious three-headed snake, That Which Rots, or the crocodilian Dragon of the Swamp.
Defilers have clear motivations, yet their methods for reaching their goals are often circuitous and inscrutable to their followers. Defilers are not always eviL but they universally desire to spread their form of corruption, blight, disease, or poison to the world Some see this as a gift, while others knowingly strive to cause torment.
