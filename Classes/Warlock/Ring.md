# Warlock Pact: Pact of the Ring
All warlocks who swear this pact wear a simple loop of dark, crystalline iron as a symbol of their station and power.

The pact's chief practitioners are the Warlock Knights of [Curvaulle](../../Cities/Curvaulle.md), spellcasting noble elites of that city's brutal, slave-based (only taken from the [Ulmhorde](../../Nations/Ulm.md), of course) feudal system. Their warped knightly order is based on an otherworldly being, a colossus known as Telos that supposedly fell onto [Curvaulle](../../Cities/Curvaulle.md), who serves as the patron of their pacts. Little is known of Telos's nature, though recent rumors state this being once had a hateful rivalry with a now-dead god known as Seriach, the Hell-Hound Whisperer (and some say a vestige of Seriach seduces renegade Warlock Knights to make new pacts, with the Whisperer as their patron). The [Curvaulle](../../Cities/Curvaulle.md)an lords harvest a substance called ironfell from Telos's body. It is hard as steel when worked, though more crystalline in structure and duller in luster. It is from ironfell that [Curvaulle](../../Cities/Curvaulle.md)'s Warlock Knights forge their pact rings.

Warlock Knights are chosen from among the most ruthless and capable in [Dradehalia](../../Nations/Dradehalia.md). A few titles have passed hereditarily, but only to heirs who have demonstrated their worthiness. Their hierarchy is loosely based on common feudal traditions. Knights without land are known as Executors, and these petty nobles serve as emissaries, spies, soldiers, and assassins for greater Warlock Knights. Landed knights, also known as Fellthanes, have absolute power over their holdings and maintain private armies. They are vassals to more powerful figures known as Vindicators. The greatest vindicators make up the Ironfell Council, which revolves around the Voice of Telos.

When you gain the Pact Boon feature at 3rd level as a warlock, you can add the following to your choices for that feature.

## Pact of the Ring
You bear a nigh-indestructible ring. If the ring is lost or somehow destroyed, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to create a replacement. While you bear this ring, once during your turn when you hit with an attack roll for a melee weapon or a cantrip, you can inflict extra radiant damage equal to your Charisma bonus on one target you hit with that attack. If the damage for the attack already includes your Charisma bonus (such as if you hit with eldritch blast and have the Agonizing Blast eldritch invocation), you cannot inflict this extra damage. An attack which includes this extra damage blazes with a violet, starlight glare.

##  New Eldritch Invocations
At 2nd level, a warlock gains the Eldritch Invocations feature. Here are new options for that feature, in addition to those in the [standard Warlock listing](../Warlock.md). If an eldritch invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn the invocation. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisite. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

***Ironfell Blade.*** *Prerequisites: 5th level, Pact of the Ring feature*. When you take the attack action on your turn and attack with a melee weapon that inflicts slashing or piercing damage, you can attack with that weapon twice, instead of once.

***Shard Star Warrior.*** *Prerequisites: 15th level*. When you make an attack roll for a melee weapon or a cantrip, you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 if you have not already inflicted a critical hit that turn.

***Starlight Hex.*** *Prerequisites: 5th level*. When you cast the hex spell using a warlock spell slot, the initial target you choose as its first subject immediately takes 1d8 magical radiant damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is blinded until the end of its next turn Also, whenever you inflict necrotic damage with your hex spell, you may choose for it to be radiant damage instead.

***Iron Sky Starfall.*** *Prerequisite: 9th level, [eldritch blast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/eldritch-blast) cantrip, Pact of the Ring feature*. When you hit a creature with your eldritch blast, you can cast hold person as a bonus action using a warlock spell slot. The spell's target must be the creature you hit with eldritch blast.
