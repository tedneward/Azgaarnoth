<p>HAG'S HERITAGE
Prerequisite: Progenitor Patron
You have advantage on saving throws against being
charmed, magic can't put you to sleep, and you are a fey
instead of your normal creature type. Also, you gain
proficiency in your choice of either Deception, Perception,
or Stealth, and you can speak, read, and write your
choice of either AbyssaL Giant, PrimordiaL or Sylvan.
In addition, you can use an action to cover yourself
and anything you are wearing or carrying with a magical
illusion that makes you look like an ugly creature of
your general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends
if you take a bonus action to end it or if you die.
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, you could appear to
have no hair, but someone touching your head might
feel your hair, if you have any hair. Otherwise, a creature
must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and
succeed on a Intelligence (Investigation) check against
your warlock spell save DC to tell you are disguised
However, you also have the following flaws:
Foul Hunger. You must eat five times as much food
as normal for your size, but humanoid flesh counts as
five times as much food for you.
Hideous Countenance. Your true appearance is ugly,
and those who see your true form or your cursed form
may become disgusted or worse. Whenever a creature
sees either your true form or your cursed form for the
first time, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving
throw or else it becomes hostile toward you. A creature
prone to violence might attack you. Another creature
might seek to flee from you or make you leave the area
in nonviolent ways (at the DM's discretion1 depending
on the nature of your interaction with it.

disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<p>VAMPIRIC AsPECT
Prerequisite: Progenitor Patron
You have resistance to necrotic damage and you are an
undead in addition to your normal creature type, but
when a game effect targets you, you choose whether it
treats you as undead or as your normal creature type.
You can also choose one extra trait from your Cursed
Shapechanger feature. You gain the benefit of that trait
while in your cursed form. Finally, your Beast of the
Curse feature treats bats, rats, and wolves as your
chosen beasts, instead of your original choice.
However, you also have the following flaws:
Forbiddance. You can't enter a residence without an
invitation from one of the occupants.

have carried for at least one long rest, to take effect later.

rest before you can use it again.
