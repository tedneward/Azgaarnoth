# Prestige Class: Guardian
A brawny monk dives in the way of an arrow meant for their ally's throat, taking the blow without flinching. Faced with a boulder-hurling giant, a wizard wielding a longsword raises his hand to magically ward his allies against the assault before teleporting to strike the giant directly. As a devil strikes down the young prince, the paladin charged with his defense cries out to her god, calling down a pillar of divine light to burn the fiend for harming her companion.

These characters have all specialized as guardians, focusing the capable talents they already possessed as an adventurer to the pursuit of defending others. The guardian prestige class is nonmagical and its lessons are usually learned upon the fields of battle or by natural talent. Some care only to defend those loyal or useful to them, while others see life itself as worth defending no matter whose life it is.

## Prerequisite(s)
In order to multiclass as a guardian, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* **Constitution 15.** To be a guardian, one must be able to trust that they are doing the right thing by placing themselves between their allies and danger. Only someone who is tough and hearty can be a truly effective guardian.

* **Character level 6th.** The skills of a guardian are predicated on combat experience, well-honed instincts, and grit. You must be at least a 6th-level character before you can gain levels in the guardian prestige class.

* **Extra Attack or Shield Proficiency.** A guardian must be capable with the tools of war to both survive and protect.

To become a guardian, one must usually find a mentor to teach them the ways of self-sacrifice, as the willingness to put oneself in harm's way is not an instinct most living creatures embrace. This will typically take the form of some kind of short apprenticeship, perhaps even a stint in a mercenary company as a leader's bodyguard under the tutelage of another guardian.

## Guardian's Calling
*1st-level guardian feature*

You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of any opportunity attacks you make equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum +1).

In addition, your grit impresses those in need of protection. When you make a Charisma check to influence a humanoid that is missing any of its hit points, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum +1).

## Guardian's Mark
*1st-level guardian feature*

When you gain your first level in this prestige class, you also learn how to excel at foiling attacks and protecting your allies by menacing your foes. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn.

Also, when you deal damage to a creature using a spell, an effect that replicates a spell or a channel divinity feature, you can choose to mark that creature if it is within 30 feet of you and can see or hear you. The mark lasts until the end of your next turn. You can't mark more creatures in a turn in this way than the number determined by your guardian level as shown in the "Ability Marks" column of the [class table](#class-features).

A creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you while it is within your reach. Your mark ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature. There is no limit to the number of creatures you can have marked at once. 

In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make one melee weapon attack against it using your reaction. This attack counts as an opportunity attack. You can make this special attack up to a number of times as shown in the "Mark Attacks" column of the class table on the previous page, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

## Protection Specialty
*2nd-level guardian feature*

You specialize in a particular style of defending your allies. You choose one option from the list below:

* **Sacrificial Dive.** When a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to force the attack to hit you instead The attack hits you regardless of your AC or other abilities. Damage resistances, damage immunities, and condition immunities still apply--the attack still hits, but may have no effect.

* **Warding Magic.** *Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell* Choose one class you have levels in that you can learn or prepare spells as. If you prepare spells as that class, you always have [shield other](/Magic/Spells/shield-other.md) prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare as that class. If not, you learn [shield other](/Magic/Spells/shield-other.md), and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can learn as that class.

  [Shield other](/Magic/Spells/shield-other.md) also counts as a class spell of that class for you, and uses that class's spellcasting ability score. Example: If you chose wizard, [shield other](/Magic/Spells/shield-other.md) is also a wizard spell for you now, and Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

## Withstand Pain
*2nd-level guardian feature*
