# Prestige Class: Tattoo Adept
Loremasters claim that the practice of ritual tattooing among the ancestors of the dark elves arose to enforce law and stability in their rigid caste system, marking people as belonging to one caste or another. It is uncertain when and by what means tattoo adepts learned their skills, but tattoos are a long and well-honored tradition. Today, members of all major cultures can be found wearing tattoos and using tattoo magic.

## Prerequisite(s)
To gain levels as a tattoo adept, you must meet the following requirements (in addition to the multiclassing prerequisites for any classes you have):

* **Dexterity 13.** Tattoo adepts must have nimble hands.
* **Intelligence 13 or Charisma 13.** Tattoo adepts must have an aptitude for arcane magic.
* **Proficiency in the Arcana skill.** A tattoo adept must be knowledgeable regarding arcane lore.
* **Proficiency with tattooist’s supplies.** A tattoo adept must be skilled in the tattooist’s art.
* **Full arcane spellcasting class feature.** To become a tattoo adept, you must have the ability to cast spells from the bard, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list.
* **Character level 5th.** You must already be a 5th-level character before you can gain tattoo adept levels.

In order to be accepted as a pupil by an established tattoo adept, you must have demonstrated that you are a skilled magician and tattoo artist in your own right. You must maintain a tattoo parlor for a period of at least one year, and you must have produced exceptional tattoos for a handful of noteworthy individuals who can spread the word of your talent.

## Class Features
As a tattoo adept, you gain the following class features.

**Tattoo Adept**
Level|Cantrips Known|Spells Known|Spell Slots|Slot Level|Features
-----|--------------|------------|-----------|----------|--------
1st  | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1st | [Dancing Ink](#dancing-ink), [Spellcasting](#spellcasting), [Tattoo Focus](#tattoo-focus)
2nd  | 1 | 3 | 3 | 1st | [Quick Ink](#quick-ink), [Tattoo Mastery](#tattoo-mastery)
3rd  | 2 | 4 | 4 | 2nd | 
4th  | 2 | 4 | 4 | 2nd | [Eldritch Tattoo](#eldritch-tattoo)
5th  | 3 | 5 | 5 | 3rd | [Craft Tattoo](#craft-tattoo)

There is no level progression beyond the 5th level in tattoo adept, though certainly the character can continue to gain experience and apply it to other classes.

### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per tattoo adept level

**Hit Points per Level:** 1d6 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per tattoo adept level

## Spellcasting
*1st-level tattoo adept feature*

The following rules apply to your spellcasting.

**Cantrips.** At 1st level, you learn one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list.

**Spell Slots.** The Tattoo Adept table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your 1st-level spells. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level (or higher). You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

**Spells Known of 1st Level.** You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the wizard spell list. You gain a third 1st-level spell when you reach 2nd level.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Choose Intelligence or Charisma. That attribute is always your spellcasting ability for your tattoo adept spells. You use that attribute whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use it when setting the saving throw DC for a tattoo adept spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen spellcasting ability modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your chosen spellcasting ability modifier

**Multiclassing.** The tattoo adept is a full spellcaster; you add all of your levels in the tattoo adept class when determining your total spell slots.

## Dancing Ink
*1st-level tattoo adept feature*

You learn how to store magical energy in a tattoo to be released at a later time. At the end of a long rest, you may store any spell you know within a nonmagical tattoo on your person. To do so, you must expend a spell slot of a sufficient level to cast the spell. The stored spell can be no higher than one spell level below the highest you can cast (minimum 1st level), and no higher than 5th level in any case.

You can have only one spell stored in this way at a time. You can cast the stored spell a number of times equal to your Intelligence or Charisma modifier, at its usual level, without expending any spell slots. Once you have done so, your Dancing Ink tattoo fades but can be recharged by exercising this feature again.

## Tattoo Focus
*1st-level tattoo adept feature*

You can use your tattoos as a spellcasting focus to cast arcane spells.

## Quick Ink
*2nd-level tattoo adept feature*

You can inscribe a Dancing Ink spell at the end of a short or long rest.

## Tattoo Mastery
*2nd-level tattoo adept feature*

Your proficiency bonus is doubled when you make an ability check that uses tattooist’s supplies.

When you activate a one of your Dancing Ink tattoos or another magic tattoo that normally grants you some bonus or benefit for a duration, you can grant the effects to one willing creature you touch instead of yourself. You can’t transfer the ability to cast a spell or any permanent benefit.

## Eldritch Tattoo
*4th-level tattoo adept feature*

You can ink a tattoo on your person to duplicate one warlock eldritch invocation effect from the following list: [Armor of Shadows](../Warlock.md#armor-of-shadows), [Beast Speech](../Warlock.md#beast-speech), [Beguiling Influence](../Warlock.md#beguiling-influence), [Devil’s Sight](../Warlock.md#devils-sight), [Eldritch Sight](../Warlock.md#eldritch-sight), [Eyes of the Rune Keeper](../Warlock.md#eyes-of-the-rune-keeper), [Fiendish Vigor](../Warlock.md#fiendish-vigor), [Gaze of Two Minds](../Warlock.md#gaze-of-two-minds), [Mask of Many Faces](../Warlock.md#mask-of-many-faces), or [Misty Visions](../Warlock.md#misty-visions). While this tattoo is on your person, you are considered to be a warlock of equal level to your tattoo adept level, using your chosen spellcasting ability modifier (if necessary).

Only one such tattoo can be on your person at a time, though it can be replaced at any time. Once you have inked this tattoo, you cannot ink another one until you have finished a long rest.

When the tattoo's power is used, it glows on your skin, casting dim light in a 5ft radius for the duration of the effect. The eldritch invocation effect can be turned off at any time as a bonus action, and the light fades but the tattoo remains active until the tattoo adept chooses to replace it.

## Craft Tattoo
*5th-level tattoo adept feature*

You have begun the study of crafting magic [tattoos](/Magic/Tattoos.md). This follows all the usual rules of crafting magic items, as described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, save that when you create magic tattoos, you require only half the usual downtime.
