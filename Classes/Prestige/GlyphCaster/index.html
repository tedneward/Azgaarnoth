<h1 id="prestige-class-glyph-caster">Prestige Class: Glyph Caster</h1>
<p>Glyphs are believed to be an offshoot branch of magic dating back to the time of the ancient Eldar, and related distantly to the power of glyphs. Some scholars believe that the power of glyphs are a scaled-down version of Eldar glyphs, because mortals could not handle the full power of glyphs, but most importantly, glyphs interact with magic of all forms, enabling glyphs to transcend classes. Glpyh casters are highly respected among many races, particularly the dwarves, but much is demanded of them as well. Glyph casters guard their secrets jealously, and rarely if ever share them with outsiders.</p>
<p>Glyph casters apply their legendary affinity for crafting to the mysteries of both arcane and divine energies. These intensely focused spellcasters learn how to solidify the energy of a spell into a tangible object, saving it for later release or, in cases of dire necessity, shatter them to produce devastating explosions.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisite(s)</h2>
<p>To gain levels as a glyph caster, you must meet the following requirements (in addition to the multiclassing prerequisites for any classes you have):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intelligence 15, Wisdom 15, or Charisma 15.</strong> Whatever their spellcasting background, glyph casters must have a strong aptitude for magic.</li>
<li><strong>Constitution 13.</strong> Glyph casters must be hardy enough to withstand rigorous training.</li>
<li><strong>Proficiency in the Arcana or Religion skill.</strong> A glyph caster must have some understanding of arcane or theological lore to master the runic arts.</li>
<li><strong>Proficiency in artisan's tools.</strong> You must be able to work in stone, wood, or some other appropriate material to inscribe your glyphs.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting class feature.</strong> To become a glyph caster, you must have at least some competence in the magical arts.</li>
<li><strong>Character level 7th.</strong> You must already be a 7th-level character before you can gain glyph caster levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to gain levels as a glyph caster, you must find a mentor willing to teach you this art. Many glyph casters are members of the <a href="../Organizations/MageSchools/SchoolOfTheEldar.md">School of the Eldar</a>, but often are jealous, secretive, and difficult to engage with. To have any chance of learning their skills, prospective students often must perform acts of service before gaining entrance to the school. Independent glyph masters may also roam the lands, willing to teach, but many guard their secrets just as jealously.</p>
<h2 id="class-features">Class Features</h2>
<p>As a glyph caster, you gain the following class features.</p>
<p><strong>Glyph Caster</strong>
Level|Cantrips Known|Spells Known|Spell Slots Per Spell Level|Inscribed glyphs|Max glyph Level|1st|2nd|3rd|Features
-----|--------------|------------|---------------------------|---------------|--------------|---|---|---|--------
1st  |1|2|2|--|--|2|1st|<a href="#glyph-magic">Glyph Magic</a>, <a href="#spellcasting">Spellcasting</a>
2nd  |1|3|3|--|--|3|2nd|glyphstore
3rd  |2|4|4|2|--|3|3rd|glyph Adept
4th  |2|5|4|3|--|4|4th|glyphshatter
5th  |3|6|4|3|2|4|5th|glyph Master</p>
<p>There is no level progression beyond the 5th level in glyph casting, though certainly the character can continue to gain experience and apply it to other classes.</p>
<h3 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h3>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per glyph caster level</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points per Level:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per glyph caster level</p>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>The glyph caster prestige class provides you a spellbook at no charge, if you don't already have one.</p>
<h2 id="glyph-magic">Glyph Magic</h2>
<p><em>1st-level glyph caster feature</em></p>
<p>You can inscribe a spell you know as a glyph or sigil onto an object or surface. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 5 feet square. If you choose an object, the object must be no smaller than a cup or flask and no larger than a lute or backpack, and it must be made of a material you can etch upon using your artisan's tools.</p>
<p>To inscribe the glyph, you must cast the spell as a ritual (even if it is not normally a ritual spell). The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. Once inscribed with a spell, the glyph remains in place, but inert, until it is triggered or dispelled.</p>
<p>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found. Once the glyph spell is triggered, the glyph or sigil remains etched in the surface, but the magical energy within dissipates and cannot be used again. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p>
<p>A glpyh spell is used in one of two ways: as a helpful glyph or a trap glyph.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Helpful Glyph:</strong> The inscribed spell must target one or more creatures. Choose a creature other than yourself when you create the glyph. That creature can use an action to trigger the glyph by touching it or speaking its name aloud. In either case, the creature must be within 10 feet of the glyph, whether it is inscribed on an object or a surface. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast, targeting the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell targets multiple creatures, the creature that triggered the glyph may decide what other creatures within range are targeted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trap Glyph:</strong> The inscribed spell must target a single creature or an area. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the glyph and attack the creature that triggered it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the surface on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyph inscribed upon an object, the most common triggers include grasping, opening, or lifting that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph.</p>
<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations etc.), or alignment. </p>
<p>You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>
<p><strong>Inscribed Glyphs.</strong> The Glyph Caster table shows the number of times you can inscribe a spell as a glyph. At 1st level, you can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum glyph Level.</strong> The Glyph Caster table shows the maximum level of spell slot you may inscribe within a glyph.</p>
<h2 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h2>
<p><em>1st-level glyph caster feature</em></p>
<p>As a student of the oldest form of written magic, you have a spellbook containing the spells you know.</p>
<p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> At 1st level, you know one cantrip of your choice from the cleric, sorcerer, or wizard spell lists. You learn additional cleric, sorcerer, or wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the glyph Caster table.</p>
<p><strong>Spellbook.</strong> At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing two 1st-level spells of your choice from the cleric, sorcerer, or wizard spell lists. Your spellbook is the repository of the spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Glyph Caster table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</p>
<p><strong>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</strong> The Spells Known column of the Glyph Caster table shows when you learn more cleric, sorcerer, or wizard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cleric, sorcerer, or wizard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the cleric, sorcerer, or wizard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. That attribute is always your spellcasting ability for your glyph caster spells. You use that attribute whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use it when setting the saving throw DC for a glyph caster spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your chosen spellcasting ability modifier</p>
<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your chosen spellcasting ability modifier</p>
<p><strong>Ritual Casting.</strong> You can cast a glyph caster spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p>
<p><strong>Multiclassing.</strong> Glyph Casters are full spellcasters, and you add all of your levels in the glyph caster class when determining your total spell slots.</p>
<h2 id="glyphstore">Glyphstore</h2>
<p><em>2nd-level glyph caster feature</em></p>
<p>You can "store" a spell. You cast the spell as a ritual (even if it is not normally a ritual spell). The spell does not have its usual effect when cast in this way. Instead, the glyphstored spell appears as a glowing, immaterial glyph floating near you, giving off dim light in a 5-foot radius. It may be targeted normally with dispel magic spells and similar effects. The glyphstored spell lasts until you finish your next long rest or you fall unconscious.</p>
<p>While your glyphstored spell lasts, you may trigger it as a reaction, at which time it takes effect normally as if you had just cast it. You determine targets and other variable aspects of the spell when you trigger it.</p>
<p>A glyphstored spell counts as an inscribed glyph.</p>
<h2 id="glyph-ward">Glyph Ward</h2>
<p><em>3rd-level glyph caster feature</em> </p>
<p>While you have at least one glyphstored spell, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
<p>Further, as a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you may sacrifice a glyphstored spell to take half damage from that attack. The glyphstored spell dissipates with no other effect when sacrificed in this way.</p>
<h2 id="glyphshatter">Glyphshatter</h2>
<p><em>4th-level glyph caster feature</em></p>
<p>You can use an action to cause two of your glyphstored spells to collide, releasing a blast of arcane energy. Each creature within a 30-foot radius originating from you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d6 force damage for each level of spell slots stored in the colliding glyphs. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage.</p>
<p>You can bend the magical energies to avoid one or more creatures within range. Choose a number of creatures equal to your chosen spellcasting ability (minimum 1 creature). The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the Glyphshatter, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.</p>
<h2 id="glyph-master">Glyph Master</h2>
