<h1 id="prestige-class-leader">Prestige Class: Leader</h1>
<p>An armored fighter, banner held high, surges past enemies and beckons her allies forward. In the misty alleyway behind a tavern, a sly rogue points to his enemies and details tactics to his allies hiding with him. A devious wizard raises zombies and orders them to join formation with his living allies while he continues weaving dark spells. A bestial druid summons wolves to her defense, taking the shape of a dire wolf herself and leading the pack's charge with a rallying howl</p>
<p>These characters are each not only their base class, but a leader too. Leaders vary in their tactics - some mostly wield weapons or spells and only occasionally bark orders, while others spend a majority of time in combat simply observing, moving, and communicating with their allies to win.</p>
<p>The leader prestige class is nonmagical and its secrets are usually learned upon the fields of battle or through natural talent. The abilities gained by being a leader are almost all useless without allies to command and support. This is what it means to be a leader - to rely on others who all rely on you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Player Note: You're Not Automatically in Charge
This class goes by the name "Leader" to describe the class's support abilities, but it isn't the same as an official title among your adventuring group. A character who takes the Leader prestige class does not have any special authority among their group. The prestige class grants mechanical abilities, but not clout in the narrative. A group can even have multiple who take the leader class! Talk with your group to decide any actual leader.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisite(s)</h2>
<p>In order to advance as a leader, you must meet the following prerequisites (in addition to the multiclassing prerequisites for your existing class or classes):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wisdom, Charisma, or Intelligence 13.</strong> A good leader requires at least good planning, vision, or talent.</li>
<li><strong>Wisdom and Charisma 11.</strong> Those who cannot understand and influence others cannot be a leader.</li>
<li><strong>Character level 5th.</strong> Without a certain level of experience under your belt, you will have a hard time leading your allies to victory and gaining the respect of your peers.</li>
<li><strong>Proficiency in a Leadership skill.</strong> You must have proficiency in at least one of Animal Handling, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Religion, Performance, or Persuasion to gain levels as a leader.</li>
</ul>
<p>The leader must be in a position where they can command others. The two main ways to achieve this are to either lead or head an organization (or portion thereof) of at least five people, but you may discuss with your DM whether you can fulfill other criteria to meet this important prerequisite (such as perhaps changing an NPC's alignment to match your own). Frequently the opportunity to lead comes with a rise in military rank, nobility, ascension within a merchant guild, and so on, that often comes with a rise in character level.</p>
<p>Note that acceptance to the <a href="../Organizations/DraconicOrder/Bronze.md">Academy of the Bronze Dragon</a> is sufficient in its own right to begin levels in this prestige class, and that many students of the Academy do not leave until they have attained 5th level in this prestige class. (The Academy will often take students that don't have the prerequisites and "farm them out" as fosters with the other Orders to help them reach the necessary levels before beginning their leadership studies in earnest.)</p>
<h2 id="class-features">Class Features</h2>
<p>As a leader, you gain the following class features:</p>
<p><strong>Leader Prestige Class</strong>
Level|Stratagems Known|Genius Uses|Features
-----|----------------|-----------|--------
lst  |2|-|Stratagems of Command
2nd  |2|1|Moment of Glory, Stroke of Genius
3rd  |3|1|Leadership Expertise, Perfect Coordination
4th  |3|2|Ability Score Improvement
5th  |4|2|Leader's Presence</p>
<p>There is no level progression beyond the 5th level in leader, though certainly the character can continue to gain experience and apply it to other classes.</p>
<h3 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h3>
<p><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> ld8 per leader level</p>
<p><strong>Hit Points per Level:</strong> ld8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per leader level</p>
<h3 id="proficiencies">Proficiencies</h3>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> None</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> None</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose one from Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, or Persuasion</p>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>The leader prestige class does not grant any equipment.</p>
<h2 id="stratagems-of-command">Stratagems of Command</h2>
<p><em>1st-level leader feature</em></p>
<p>When you gain your first level in this prestige class, you gain access to abilities called Stratagems. You learn 2 Stratagems of your choice from the Stratagems List immediately when you reach 1st level, and learn additional Stratagems of your choice from the list as you gain levels in this prestige class, as shown on the class table. When you gain a level in this prestige class, you may choose one Stratagem that you know and replace it with a different one.</p>
<p>Stratagems are not magical and cannot be counterspelled or dispelled. They can be used at-will at any time, and do not have a limited number of uses. You can only use Stratagems that you know.</p>
<p>All stratagems describe affecting an "ally" or "allies." Stratagems can only affect allied creatures as an "ally" target if they meet all of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ally targets must willingly allow you to affect them (or must be charmed and unwillingly allow you to do so)</li>
<li>Ally targets must be able to see and hear you (even via telepathy, illusion, or other magic)</li>
<li>Ally targets must be able to take reactions (even if they have already used their reaction this round)</li>
<li>Ally targets must not have used a Stratagem of Command themselves since the start of their last turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have used a Stratagem, you cannot use any Stratagems until the start of your next turn.</p>
<h2 id="moment-of-glory">Moment of Glory</h2>
<p><em>2nd-level leader feature</em></p>
<p>You learn how to respond as a leader in times of extreme crisis. You gain each of the abilities listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All According to Plan.</strong> When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you who can see and hear you makes a weapon attack, but before they roll you can use your reaction to grant that creature advantage on the attack. If the attack hits, it becomes a critical hit.</li>
<li><strong>Believe in Yourself.</strong> When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you who can see and hear you fails a saving throw, you can use your reaction to allow that creature to reroll the saving throw. They must use the new roll.</li>
<li><strong>Don't You Die on Me.</strong> You can use an action to touch one creature that has 0 hit points and is not stabilized. The creature is restored to 1 hit point, and it can also choose to spend up to a number of hit dice equal to half your proficiency bonus, regaining hit points as it would if it had spent those hit dice at the end of a short rest. In addition, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to its total number of hit dice + your proficiency bonus for 1 minute.</li>
<li><strong>It's Now or Never.</strong> When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you who can see and hear you and can take actions begins their turn, you can use your reaction to impart a sense of extreme urgency upon them. That creature can immediately Dash and Disengage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have used any of these abilities, you cannot use any of them again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h2 id="stroke-of-genius">Stroke of Genius</h2>
<p><em>2nd-level leader feature</em></p>
<p>You can use a bonus action to activate one of your Stratagems that normally requires an action, or use one of your Stratagems that normally requires a bonus action or reaction without that requirement. You can do so even if you've already used a Stratagem this round, and doing so doesn't prevent you from using another Stratagem before the start of your next turn.</p>
<p>Once you have done so, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest. The number of uses increases to 2 when you reach 4th level.</p>
<h2 id="leadership-expertise">Leadership Expertise</h2>
<p><em>3rd-level leader feature</em></p>
<p>Your experience as a leader has taught you lessons and might have motivated you to seek out new lessons from the masters of your field You excel beyond the normal capabilities of those pursuing the art of leadership. Choose one of the following skills or tools: Animal Handling, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Performance, Persuasion, or Religion, or navigator's tools, any gaming set, or any musical instrument. You must choose a skill or tool that you already have proficiency with. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability checks you make that use that proficiency.</p>
<p>In addition, choose one of the following benefits to permanently gain:
* <strong>Battlefield Conductor.</strong> You treat your leader class features and stratagems that describe 30 feet or 60 feet as if those ranges were doubled.
* <strong>Formation Master.</strong> You can move through friendly creatures' spaces without treating them as difficult terrain, and when you provoke an opportunity attack by moving into a friendly creature's space, that opportunity attack has disadvantage.
* <strong>Frontline Commander.</strong> When you use a Stratagem of Command, your speed increases by 10 feet until the end of your next turn. This effect does not stack.
* <strong>Versatile Communicator.</strong> If a leader feature requires that creatures be able to see and hear you, instead it only needs to be able to see or hear you, including via telepathy, illusion, or other magic.</p>
<h2 id="perfect-coordination">Perfect Coordination</h2>
<p><em>3rd-level leader feature</em></p>
<p>When another friendly creature who can see and hear you (telepathic hearing counts) would start its turn, it can choose to use its reaction to delay its turn. Its turn does not start when it normally would It begins to wait for your signal and the next turn begins instead.</p>
<p>Each time a turn ends, you may use your reaction to signal any friendly creatures that are waiting for it which you can see. Those creatures begin their delayed turns. If there are multiple delayed turns, you choose the order in which they occur. After these turns are taken, the creatures' initiatives change to match the new order. Effects that occur at the start or end of the creature's turn both happen when the turn is delayed, not when the delayed turn is finally taken.</p>
<p>A creature can choose to ignore the signal but it will not take its delayed turn. A creature who does not take its delayed turn loses its delayed turn and takes its next turn in the normal initiative order.</p>
<h2 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h2>
<p>When you reach 4th level you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h2 id="leaders-presence">Leader's Presence</h2>
<p><em>5th-level leader feature</em></p>
<p>Your very presence begins to affect those you lead and fight with, propeling them to new heights under your watch. A creature cannot benefit from the same kind of presence more than once at the same time. Choose one of the following benefits to permanently gain whenever you are not incapacitated:</p>
<h3 id="soothing-presence">Soothing Presence</h3>
<p>You and creatures of your choice that can see and hear you are soothed by your very presence and leadership. Whenever an affected creature regains hit points from a class feature that restores more than 4 hit points or from spending hit dice, it regains additional hit points equal to half your proficiency bonus (if more than one hit die is spent, each hit die gains the bonus).</p>
<p>If a spell causes an affected creature to regain hit points, it regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus or twice the spell's level whichever is higher. Divide this bonus in half if the spell duration is anything longer than Instantaneous, if the casting time is less than 1 action, or if the spell can heal more than one creature per casting.</p>
<h3 id="distracting-presence">Distracting Presence</h3>
<p>Other creatures of your choice that can see and hear you are distracted, vexed, confused, disarmed, or intimidated by your very presence. Whenever an afflicted creature misses with an attack against you or a creature within 30 feet of you, you vex it, giving it disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of that tum.</p>
<p>A missed attack cannot trigger this presence if the attack roll had disadvantage from this presence.</p>
<p>You must be able to take reactions to give an attack disadvantage with this presence.</p>
<h3 id="riotous-presence">Riotous Presence</h3>
<p>You and creatures of your choice that can see and hear you are incensed and invigorated by your style of leadership and your very presence. Affected creatures increase their speed by 10 feet.</p>
<p>In addition, whenever an affected creature reduces a foe to 0 hit points or scores a critical hit, the entire team is encouraged. The first time any other affected creature deals damage before the start of your next tum, it increases the damage dealt to one creature of its choice by an amount equal to twice your proficiency bonus.</p>
<h3 id="tactical-presence">Tactical Presence</h3>
<p>You and creatures of your choice that can see and hear you are reassured by your tactical leadership and the strategic brilliance exuded by your very presence. Whenever affected creatures roll initiative and you are not surprised, they gain a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1).</p>
<p>In addition, when an affected creature other than you hits a
target that is within 60 feet of you that you can see with a weapon attack and there is at least one other affected
creature within 5 feet of the target, the attack deals bonus damage equal to 1 + half your proficiency bonus. An attacker
can only benefit from this bonus damage once per turn.</p>
<h3 id="insightful-presence">Insightful Presence</h3>
<p>Other creatures of your choice that can see and hear you are reassured, calmed, and cautioned by your presence. Affected creatures gain a bonus to Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Insight), and Intelligence (Investigation) checks equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum +1).</p>
<p>In addition, when a creature that you can see, hear, or sense makes an attack against an affected creature, you apply a -3 penalty to the attack roll. </p>
<p>Once this penalty has been applied to aid an affected creature, it cannot be applied to aid that creature again until the start of the affected creature's next turn.</p>
<h3 id="inspiring-presence">Inspiring Presence</h3>
<p>Other creatures of your choice that can see and hear you are bolstered by the inspiring nature of your very presence and countenance. Affected creatures gain a +2 bonus to saving throw rolls and Charisma ability checks.</p>
<p>In addition, whenever an affected creature gains temporary hit points, you increase the temporary hit points gained by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum +1).</p>
