# Prestige Classes
Many of the character concepts that were once prestige classes or paragon paths in earlier editions of D&D are now options available to 1stlevel characters. In general, the game's design aims for maximum flexibility, making options available to all characters. As such, prestige classes build on the game's broad range of basic options to represent specialized options and unique training.

## Using Prestige Classes
A prestige class requires a high level of skill before a character can master even its basic elements. Prestige classes might confer lost lore, allow access to an inscrutable form of magic, grant mastery of an exotic fighting style, or be built around the knowledge harbored by a secret society.

Mechanically, a prestige class is a character class that requires the same training and focus as any other class. You enter a prestige class by way of the normal multiclassing rules. However, you cannot enter a prestige class until you are at least 3rd level--and many prestige classes have even higher level requirements. 

Most prestige classes require characters to complete specific deeds in order to gain access to the class. You cannot advance in a prestige class until its gatekeepers--typically those who harbor the class's lore--agree to accept you.

A prestige class typically offers access to unique game mechanics available only to members of that class. Such mechanics reflect specific lore, secrets, or techniques impossible to master without earning the respect and trust of those who already possess that knowledge.

### Joining a Prestige Class
In order to join a prestige class, you must first check with your Dungeon Master. A DM can opt to include or disallow prestige classes in the game. Typically, a prestige class requires you to undertake specific actions in the game so that your character can begin pursuing that class. If those actions aren't already possible in your campaign, talk to your DM about integrating the prestige class that interests you.

A prestige class uses the normal D&D multiclassing rules (see chapter 6, "Customization Options," in the Player's Handbook). When your character is ready to advance a level, you can choose to gain a level in a prestige class. Your levels in all your classes, including prestige classes, are added together to determine your character level.

#### Prerequisites
Taking up a prestige class through multiclassing involves meeting certain prerequisites, just as with multiclassing into a standard class. You must meet the ability score prerequisites for your current class and for the prestige class in order to qualify for it.

A prestige class requires a minimum character level and a minimum score in at least one ability, as well as requiring that you complete a specific deed--finding a magic item, defeating a monster, surviving a particular challenge, and so on--before being able to take up that class.

#### Experience Points
Just as with the standard rules for multiclassing, the experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice
Each prestige class specifies the hit points you gain from it. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes and prestige classes to determine your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you simply pool them together.

#### Proficiency Bonus and Proficiencies
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. A prestige class specifies whether it grants proficiencies when you enter it.

#### Prestige Class Features
You gain prestige class features just like normal class features. Sometimes, a prestige class can improve features you have gained from other classes. If a prestige class grants Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, or Unarmored Defense, that feature is treated the same way as if you had gained it from multiple standard classes.

#### Spellcasting
Some prestige classes grant spellcasting. Each prestige class provides details on how to determine your overall spellcasting ability, using the rules for spellcasting and multiclass characters.
