<h1 id="prestige-class-guardian">Prestige Class: Guardian</h1>
<p>A brawny monk dives in the way of an arrow meant for their ally's throat, taking the blow without flinching. Faced with a boulder-hurling giant, a wizard wielding a longsword raises his hand to magically ward his allies against the assault before teleporting to strike the giant directly. As a devil strikes down the young prince, the paladin charged with his defense cries out to her god, calling down a pillar of divine light to burn the fiend for harming her companion.</p>
<p>These characters have all specialized as guardians, focusing the capable talents they already possessed as an adventurer to the pursuit of defending others. The guardian prestige class is nonmagical and its lessons are usually learned upon the fields of battle or by natural talent. Some care only to defend those loyal or useful to them, while others see life itself as worth defending no matter whose life it is.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisite(s)</h2>
<p>In order to multiclass as a guardian, you must meet the following prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Constitution 15.</strong> To be a guardian, one must be able to trust that they are doing the right thing by placing themselves between their allies and danger. Only someone who is tough and hearty can be a truly effective guardian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Character level 6th.</strong> The skills of a guardian are predicated on combat experience, well-honed instincts, and grit. You must be at least a 6th-level character before you can gain levels in the guardian prestige class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extra Attack or Shield Proficiency.</strong> A guardian must be capable with the tools of war to both survive and protect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To become a guardian, one must usually find a mentor to teach them the ways of self-sacrifice, as the willingness to put oneself in harm's way is not an instinct most living creatures embrace. This will typically take the form of some kind of short apprenticeship, perhaps even a stint in a mercenary company as a leader's bodyguard under the tutelage of another guardian.</p>
<h2 id="class-features">Class Features</h2>
<p>As a guardian, you gain the following class features.</p>

<h3 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h3>

<p><strong>Hit Points per Level:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per guardian level</p>
<h3 id="proficiencies">Proficiencies</h3>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> None</p>
<p><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> None</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> None</p>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>The guardian prestige class does not grant any equipment.</p>
<h2 id="guardians-calling">Guardian's Calling</h2>
<p><em>1st-level guardian feature</em></p>
<p>You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of any opportunity attacks you make equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum +1).</p>
<p>In addition, your grit impresses those in need of protection. When you make a Charisma check to influence a humanoid that is missing any of its hit points, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum +1).</p>
<h2 id="guardians-mark">Guardian's Mark</h2>
<p><em>1st-level guardian feature</em></p>
<p>When you gain your first level in this prestige class, you also learn how to excel at foiling attacks and protecting your allies by menacing your foes. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>Also, when you deal damage to a creature using a spell, an effect that replicates a spell or a channel divinity feature, you can choose to mark that creature if it is within 30 feet of you and can see or hear you. The mark lasts until the end of your next turn. You can't mark more creatures in a turn in this way than the number determined by your guardian level as shown in the "Ability Marks" column of the <a href="#class-features">class table</a>.</p>
<p>A creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you while it is within your reach. Your mark ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature. There is no limit to the number of creatures you can have marked at once. </p>
<p>In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make one melee weapon attack against it using your reaction. This attack counts as an opportunity attack. You can make this special attack up to a number of times as shown in the "Mark Attacks" column of the class table on the previous page, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h2 id="protection-specialty">Protection Specialty</h2>
<p><em>2nd-level guardian feature</em></p>
<p>You specialize in a particular style of defending your allies. You choose one option from the list below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sacrificial Dive.</strong> When a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to force the attack to hit you instead The attack hits you regardless of your AC or other abilities. Damage resistances, damage immunities, and condition immunities still apply--the attack still hits, but may have no effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Warding Magic.</strong> <em>Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell</em> Choose one class you have levels in that you can learn or prepare spells as. If you prepare spells as that class, you always have <a href="../../../Magic/Spells/shield-other/">shield other</a> prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare as that class. If not, you learn <a href="../../../Magic/Spells/shield-other/">shield other</a>, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can learn as that class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../Magic/Spells/shield-other/">Shield other</a> also counts as a class spell of that class for you, and uses that class's spellcasting ability score. Example: If you chose wizard, <a href="../../../Magic/Spells/shield-other/">shield other</a> is also a wizard spell for you now, and Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p>
<h2 id="withstand-pain">Withstand Pain</h2>
<p><em>2nd-level guardian feature</em></p>
<p>Your resolve grows, and you become able to steel yourself against injuries that would fell a lesser warrior. As a bonus action on your turn, or as a reaction before you take damage from a creature that is marked by you, you can focus your will and gain temporary hit points equal to ld4 + your guardian level + half your total level. These temporary hit points disappear after 1 minute.</p>
<p>You can use this ability up to a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once) and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h2 id="powerful-reprisal">Powerful Reprisal</h2>
<p><em>3rd-level guardian feature</em>
You practice and master unique abilities that you use to strike against enemies who defy your bulwark.</p>
<p>Choose two of the techniques below to learn permanently. When you gain another level in the guardian class, you can choose to change one of the techniques you learned for this feature to a different technique.</p>
<p>When a creature within 60 feet of you that is marked by you and that you can see deals damage to a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to perform one of these techniques, with that enemy as your target. If a technique enables you to make a melee weapon attack, that attack counts as an opportunity attack.</p>
<p>You can use this feature up to two times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level the number of uses per long rest increases to three.</p>
<h3 id="divine-reprisal">Divine Reprisal</h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Channel Divinity feature</em></p>
<p>When you use this technique, you can immediately use your Channel Divinity for a Channel Divinity option that would normally require an action or bonus action to activate. If you do so and the Channel Divinity option you chose can target creatures, you must target either the triggering enemy or the creature that was damaged Immediately after using this technique, you regain hit points equal to half your level + twice your Constitution modifier.</p>
<h3 id="furious-reprisal">Furious Reprisal</h3>
<p>When you use this technique, you become furious at the triggering enemy until the end of your next turn. While furious, your speed increases by 10 feet and you have advantage on weapon attacks made against the triggering enemy. If they are melee weapon attacks, they also count as opportunity attacks.</p>
<p>If you have the Rage class feature, you can enter your rage when you use this technique, consuming a use as normal. If you are raging and furious when you make a melee weapon attack against the triggering enemy, you score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.</p>
<h3 id="leaping-reprisal">Leaping Reprisal</h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Step of the Wind feature or a base flying speed</em></p>
<p>When you use this technique, you can jump up to 60 feet and up to 20 feet high to a space within 5 feet of the triggering enemy, or fly up to 60 feet to that space if you have a flying speed Then you make a melee weapon attack against the triggering enemy with advantage and a bonus to the damage roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum + 1)</p>
<h3 id="martial-reprisal">Martial Reprisal</h3>
<p>When you use this technique, you can draw or stow up to two extra weapons. You make one melee weapon attack or up to two ranged weapon attacks against the triggering enemy. These attacks have advantage and deal bonus damage equal to your Constitution modifier. Finally, you can draw or stow one more weapon at any time that turn.</p>
<p>If you hit with a melee weapon attack using this technique, the target must make a Strength saving throw. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. The target falls prone on a failed save. </p>
<h3 id="planar-reprisal">Planar Reprisal</h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell</em></p>
<p>When you use this technique, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, then make a weapon attack against the triggering enemy. This attack deals bonus force damage equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum + 1) and it counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance or immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
<h3 id="spell-reprisal">Spell Reprisal</h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell</em></p>
<p>When you use this technique, you can immediately cast a spell that normally requires a bonus action or an action to cast, as long as the expended slot level is not higher than your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). The spell must affect the triggering enemy and affect no other creatures except you.</p>
<h3 id="threatening-reprisal">Threatening Reprisal</h3>
<p>When you use this technique, you glare and shout at the creature fiercely. If the triggering enemy can see and hear you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. On a failed saving throw, the creature is frightened until the end of your next turn. While frightened in this way, the creature can't take actions, reactions, or bonus actions, and it can't make attacks unless the attack is granted by a legendary action.</p>
<h2 id="unwavering">Unwavering</h2>
<p><em>3rd-level guardian feature</em></p>
<p>Whenever you gain temporary hit points, you increase the temporary hit points gained by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus.</p>
<p>In addition, you can always find the vigor needed to aid and protect. You gain the following benefits at all times:
* While you are carrying a friendly creature, you add your Constitution score to your Strength score for the purposes of determining your carrying capacity.
* When you make a Strength check or Dexterity check to rescue a friendly creature from imprisonment, you gain a bonus to the roll equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum + 1). Examples: Lifting a portcullis, picking the lock on a cage, freeing an ally from a net or web, etc.
* While you are traveling or standing watch with others, you gain a bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum + 1) for the purposes of noticing hidden threats.</p>
<h2 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h2>
<p>When you reach 4th level you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. As normal you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<h2 id="unyielding">Unyielding</h2>
<p><em>5th-level guardian feature</em></p>
<p>Whenever you hit with an opportunity attack and deal damage to the target, you gain an additional bonus to the damage roll equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain the use of your reaction at the end of that turn.</p>
<p>In addition, when you finish a short rest and roll a hit die to regain hit points, you can choose to rero11 the die and use the new result instead You can use this to affect up to a number of hit dice equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>Finally, when you roll initiative and have no uses of the special attack granted by your Guardian's Mark feature remaining, you regain one use of the special attack.</p></div>
