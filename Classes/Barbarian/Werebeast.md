# Primal Path: Path of the Werebeast
The curse of lycanthropy can be a boon to those who embrace the power it provides. Barbarians that are used to the altered mental state of their rage often have less difficulty with controlling the curse and its corrupting influences on their behavior, but no one can easily tame their inner were-beast once it is unleashed
Most were-beast barbarians are actual lycanthropes, having been only recently bitten by another lycanthrope or corrupted by dark magic, like a cursed fur belt. Other were-beasts are the heir to a unique generational curse that transforms them, passed down from the hapless ancestor who earned the wrath of a hag, fiend, or god

BESTIAL BOND
At 3rd leveL your lycanthropic connection with the form of a beast grants you the special abilities of that beast. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, or if you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet, up to a maximum range of 150 feet.
In addition, you choose one of the following options for your bond: bear, boar, cobra, crocodile, rat, shark, tiger, or wolf. You gain a trait based on your choice.

Crocodile. You have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, you can hold your breath for 10 minutes, and your bite attack improves. Its weapon die increases to ldl0, and on a hit, you can use your bonus action to cause the target to become grappled by your bite. Until this grapple ends, you can't bite another target.

The transformation lasts for 2 hours or until you are reduced to Ohit points. You can use your action to end the transformation early, but only after at least 1 hour. The duration increases to 4 hours at 6th leveL 6 hours at 10th leveL 8 hours at 14th leveL and unending at 20th leveL although the minimum duration of 1 hour remains unchanged Your DM can waive the minimum duration for a transformation if they desire.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend one usage of your rage to use this feature again.
FERAL SHAPE
At 6th leveL you gain the ability to complete your bestial transformation. You can use an action on your turn to transform into a full beast based on your choice of were- beast. This transformation follows all the same rules as the druid's Wild Shape class feature, except for what is stated differently in this feature.
You can transform into only one creature and no others, which is based on your choice for your Bestial Bond feature, as shown in the table below:

Bond | Beast Form
---- | ------------
Bear | Brown Bear
Boar | Giant Boar
Cobra | Constrictor Snake 
Crocodile | Crocodile
Rat | Giant Badger 
Shark |Hunter Shark
Tiger | Tiger 
Wolf | Wolf

While transformed, your statistics for your hit points, AC, and ability scores remain unchanged, and you keep any special senses your normal form possesses. Instead of the beast's normal size, you choose to be either Large or Medium when you transform. If you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check, you use the beast's Dexterity score for the check instead of your own. You also benefit from the special traits for your bond's Were-Beast Form, but not the bonus to AC or damage rolls.
The transformation lasts for up to 1 hour, until you are reduced to Ohit points, or until you choose to end it as an action. When the transformation ends, you resume whatever form you were in when it began.
Once you transform, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. The number of uses per long rest increases to two at 10th leveL and the uses become unlimited at 20th level
In addition, your natural weapons in your Were-Beast Form and your Feral Shape form count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance or immunity.
LUNAR RESOLVE
Starting at 10th leveL while you are in your Were-Beast Form or your Feral Shape transformation, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or having your emotions changed by magic, and you are immune to any effect that can only target beasts unless you choose to be affected
In addition, when you use your Were-Beast Form or Feral Shape feature, you can regain hit points equal to twice your barbarian level Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
SECOND SKIN
At 14th leveL you start to feel more at home in your werebeast form than your true form. You might feel that this lycanthropic form, rather than the form you were born in, is what you were always meant to be.
While you are in your Were-Beast Form, the AC granted by your Unarmored Defense feature increases by 1, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't using silvered weapons. While you are raging, any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage that you take from such attacks is reduced by an amount equal to half your proficiency bonus and can't reduce your hit points below half of your hit point maximum.
Also, regardless of your form, you have advantage on saving throws against curses, diseases, and effects that would reveal your true form against your will
