# Ranger Conclave: Dragonstalker
Dragonstalkers are most well-known for their ability to hunt the beasts from which their name is derived: dragons. However, they have proven time and again to possess the versatility to take on other monsters of similar caliber. These rangers train with a specialized skill set focused on staying hidden from their quarry and throwing attacks that manage to find their way through even the toughest of hides.

Like the [Dragon Slayers](../Fighter/DragonSlayer.md) with whom they frequently associated, Dragonstalkers are welcome in some circles and highly suspicious in others.

## Aimed Strike
When you choose this conclave at 3rd level, you gain the ability to find and exploit weak points on your enemy. Once on each of your turns, if you have advantage on an attack roll, you can deal an extra 2d6 damage to the target. You don't need advantage on the attack roll if one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target. If you are using a ranged weapon, you must be within 30 feet of the target to use this ability, because of the accuracy and power required to pull off this manuever.

If you have a similar ability (such as the Rogue's Sneak Attack), you must choose to use one class feature or the other; you cannot use both on a single attack roll.

## Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Skulker
When you reach 7th level, you have learned to evade the detection abilities of even the most perceptive of creatures. You can spend one minute preparing yourself to mask your scent. While masked in this way, if the DM determines that you can hide from a creature, that creature gains no benefit from its blindsight or darkvision to percieve you. This effect lasts for one hour. Additionally, while hidden in this way, you can choose to move silently. While moving silently, your movement speed for that turn is halved.

This ability has no effect on creatures with tremorsense or truesight, or against spells such as true seeing. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Pierce
Once you reach 11th level, you have mastered the art of finding weak spots in hide, scales, and other natural armors of creatures. Once on each of your turns, you may choose to ignore a creature's natural armor for a single attack. For that attack, if the target is not wearing armor, the target's Armor Class becomes 10 + its Dexterity modifier. 

## Stalker's Knowledge
When you reach 15th level, your knowledge of your favored enemies is nearly unparalleled. Choose one of the following options. This choice cannot be changed.

* **Insight**. You have gained several insights into the combat abilities of your favored enemies. As an action, you can choose a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, which must be one of your favored enemies. When you do so, you learn one of the following statistics about the creature:
  * Armor Class
  * Current Hit Points
  * Str, Dex, or Con score

* **Ire**. You have an increased ability to slay your foes. You gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against all of your favored enemies.
* **Versatility**. You have experience stalking multiple kinds of monsters.  You may choose another favored enemy from the list that you choose from at 1st level.
