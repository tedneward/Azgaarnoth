# Ranger Conclave: Wrangler
The wranglers are masters of capture and nonlethal combat, using bolas (weighted ropes that wrap around a target's legs when thrown) and nets to take a target down without spilling blood.

> **SPECIAL RANGED WEAPONS**
> Weapon|Cost|Damage|Weight|Properties
> ------|----|------|------|----------
> Bola|3 sp| -- |1 lb.|Special, Thrown (30/90)
> 
> A Large or smaller creature hit by a bola is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, and cannot stand up again until it is freed. A bola has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 2 slashing damage to the bola (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the bola.

## Hindering Strikes
*3rd-level Wrangler feature*

You learn to hamstring your foes. When you hit and deal damage to a creature with a weapon attack, you can choose to hinder it until the start of your next turn, lowering its speed by 10 feet, or by 20 feet if it was an opportunity attack. This can affect a creature multiple times at once, so you can lower its speed to 0 if you hit with enough attacks.

## Ensnarement Mastery
*3rd-level Wrangler feature*

At 3rd level you begin to master the art of trapping your foes. Your range with a net increases to 15/30 feet, and you can ignore the restriction on the normal number of net attacks that a creature can make with one action or reaction.

You also gain proficiency with the bola. You add your Proficiency bonus to the DC for creatures to escape from your nets and bolas, and to the AC of your nets and bolas.

Nets that you throw gain a bonus to hit points equal to your ranger level and bolas gain half that bonus. Creatures that you hit with a bola or a net have disadvantage on checks to break free until the end of your next turn.

You can use your draw/stow on your turn to recover a nondestroyed bola or net from an incapacitated or dead creature within 5 feet of you. Also, when you make an attack with a bola or net, you can draw or stow an additional weapon immediately afterward.

## Slip the Snare
*7th-level Wrangler feature*

Your experience in snaring prey has given you new insight into making your escapes. Opportunity attacks and attacks from traps made against you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on ability checks made to escape from a grapple and on saving throws made to defend against traps. You can also move through enemies' spaces, but you still cannot end your turn in an occupied space.

## Multiattack
*11th-level Wrangler feature*

You choose one of the following two options to gain as a permanent benefit:
* **Crowd Control.** You can hinder multiple enemies by forcing them into each other's way. When you hit and deal damage to a creature with a weapon attack, you can choose to use your Hindering Strikes to lower the speed of each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target, even if you did not choose to lower the target's speed
* **Dual Snare.** You can wrap multiple enemies in your snares. When you attack a creature with a net or bola, you can choose to make the attack with the same weapon against one additional creature within 5 feet of the first. If both attacks hit, the two creatures are snagged together; while the snare holds (and neither escapes~ they are both grappled by the other, and destroying the snare frees both creatures.

## All Before Me Are Prey
*15th-level Wrangler feature*

You achieve total mastery of the art of capturing your foes, and no prey is too much for your snares. When a creature comes within 15 feet of you on its turn, you can use your reaction to make an attack against it using a bola or net.

Also, your bolas and nets can now affect huge creatures and formless creatures (who are normally immune to nets).

Finally, when you use your reaction to make an opportunity attack provoked by an enemy creature's movement, you can immediately make a second opportunity attack against that creature.
