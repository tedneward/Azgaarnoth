# Ranger Conclave: Deep Stalkers
Adventurers descending into the depths on desperate quests or in response to the promise of vast riches quickly come face to face with the evil that festers beneath the earth. Though many such characters are only too happy to escape back to the surface world again, rangers with the Deep Stalker archetype welcome each foray into the world below, striving to uncover and defeat the threats of the Underdark before those threats can reach the surface. Deep Stalkers scout for new passages into the Underdark, carefully mapping them and working to ensure they remain watched at all times. They venture into the depths on long, dangerous patrols, disappearing for months at a time. Many of them never return.

Many Deep Stalkers are elves, as those folk know all too well the threat posed by the drow. Many more came from the ranks of the dwarves (and gnomes, though less so), particularly during the eras of the Returns as the dwarves sought to reclaim all their ancestral homelands and underkeeps. Dragonborn also frequently took up the challenge, but more recently numerous of the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md) have taken this specialization to heart as they look to carve out a role for themselves in the world above and below.

Deep Stalkers master spells useful in navigating the Underdark, and their combat tactics focus on ambush, surprise, and stealth. They fight alone or in small groups in hostile territory, relying on clever tactics to carry the day.

## Underdark Scout
At 3rd level, you master the art of the ambush. On your first turn during combat, you gain a +10 bonus to your speed. If you use the attack action on that turn, you can make one additional attack.
You gain an additional benefit on all turns after your first turn. At the end of each such turn, you can attempt to hide as a bonus action if you meet the normal requirements for hiding. Deep Stalkers often use this ability to make ranged attacks, move beyond the scope of their foes’ darkvision, and then hide.

## Deep Stalker Magic
From 3rd level, you have darkvision with a range of 90 feet. You also gain access to additional spells at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 15th level. You are always able to cast these spells, and they do not count against your number of ranger spells known.

**Deep Stalker Spells**

## Iron Mind
At 7th level, you gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

## Stalker’s Flurry
Starting at 11th level, you have the ability to ensure that your attacks count. If you miss with an attack during your turn, you can immediately make an additional attack. You can gain one additional attack during your turn with this ability.

## Stalker’s Dodge
At 15th level, you master the ability to disrupt an opponent’s attacks. If a creature attacks you and does not have advantage on the attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant it disadvantage on the attack roll. You must use this ability before you know the result of the attack.
