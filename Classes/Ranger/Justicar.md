# Ranger Conclave: Justicar
You are a master of observation, intuition, and interrogation, equally at home hunting your prey down the streets of a crowded metropolis or across the savage wilderness. Rangers of your Conclave specialize in solving intricate mysteries and outwitting the most intelligent and devious opponents. Sometimes known as Thief Takers, Stalkers, or Sleuths, they bring justice to enemies with a combination of preternatural senses and perfect deductive logic. While others with such skills might confine their activities to one wilderness region or city-state, you pursue foes across any border or frontier.

The most famous of the Justicars are the Marshals of [Yithi](/Nations/Yithi.md). The success of that group has led several other nations to seek to follow in their example, with varying results.

## Justicar Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Justicar Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

**Justicar Spells**
You gain these spells at the ranger levels listed:
* 3rd level: [cause fear]()
* 5th level: [detect thoughts]()
* 9th level: [clarity of mind]()
* 11th level: [locate creature]() 
* 17th level: [legend lore]()

## Relentless Awareness
When you choose this ranger archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Perception skill. If you are already proficient with Perception, you may choose to become proficient with one of the following skills instead: Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Persuasion, or Survival. When determining your passive Perception score, you add double your proficiency bonus instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

In addition, whenever you fail an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) check, you can spend a ranger spell slot to reroll that check with advantage. You must use the second roll.

## Instant Deduction
Also at 3rd level, you can focus your deductive powers on a single target, analyzing its weaknesses and gaining insights on how to defeat it. As a bonus action, you can force a creature you can see that isn’t incapacitated to make a Charisma saving throw against your ranger spell DC. The target has disadvantage on this saving throw if it is your favored enemy. If the target fails, once during each of your turns, you can roll 1d6 and add the result to one of the following rolls of your choice:
* A damage roll for a weapon attack against the target
* A Charisma check to influence the target
* An Intelligence or Wisdom check to discern information about the target

These benefits last until you finish a short or long rest. They end early if you target a different creature with this feature.

## Penetrating Analysis
At 7th level, when you use your Instant Deduction feature on a creature you have spent at least 1 minute interacting with or observing outside of combat during the past hour, it has disadvantage on the Charisma saving throw.

In addition, when you use your Instant Deduction feature on a creature, you also learn something about them. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:
* An ability score of your choice
* Armor Class
* Current hit points.
* Total class levels (if any)
* Levels in a particular class (if any)

At the DM’s option, you might also deduce a fact about the creature’s history or one of its personality traits, if it has any.

## Twenty Moves Ahead
At 11th level, you can see through your opponent’s deceptions and anticipate their actions. When a creature that is the target of your Instant Deduction feature misses you with an attack roll, that creature provokes an opportunity attack from you. In addition, all Charisma (Deception) checks against you are made with disadvantage.

## Predictive Deduction
Beginning at 15th level, while a creature that you have successfully used your Instant Deduction feature on within the last hour is also the target of a spell on which you are maintaining concentration, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks against that creature, and on any saving throw which that creature forces you to make.
