# Roguish Archetype: Trapper

## Trap Mastery
*3rd-level trapper feature*

You learn the secrets of arranging precisionperfect traps to catch your enemies in their most vulnerable moments. 

You gain proficiency with your choice of either Alchemist's Supplies, Poisoner's Kit, or Tinker's Tools.

You also learn how to create and arrange amazing traps with which to catch your enemies. Arranging a trap takes 1 minute of uninterrupted work, and to do so you must both have the trap's materials and meet the trap's requirements. If a trap's materials include a tool, proficiency is not required, and the tool is not expended in the making of the trap.

To place a trap in a lock, you can use a door or any other object that can lock, and you can choose whether the trap activates upon unlocking or upon opening. If not placed in a lock, a trap activates when a creature other than you moves within the activation range of the trap. When you arrange a trap, you can choose to reduce its activation range to a lower value. A trap will attempt to target as many creatures other than you as it can when it activates, preferring closer targets, but it will always target the activating creature. A trap will only activate once and then fall apart.

You can only use this feature to arrange a trap a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). When you finish a long rest, you restore all uses of this feature.

You know how to make a number of traps equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) chosen from the list below as the number increases. You can choose to replace one trap you know with a different trap when you gain a rogue level.

Traps that require your enemies to make an ability check or a saving throw against a DC use your Trap DC, which equals 8 + your Intelligence modifier+ your proficiency bonus.

When you finish arranging a trap, it is hidden. If an enemy isn't aware of your trap's existence, it has disadvantage on saving throws to defend against the trap's activation effect.

A foe can detect your traps by using an action to make a Wisdom (Perception) ability check against your Trap DC. Once a trap is detected, a creature can take an action on its turn to walk and act very carefully and become unable to trigger the trap by moving until the end of its turn.

A creature who is aware of a trap can also use an action to touch the trap and make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) ability check against your Trap DC. The creature has disadvantage on this ability check. On a success, the creature disarms your trap and it falls apart harmlessly. On a failure, the creature activates the trap.

## Caltrop Mastery
*3rd-level trapper feature*

You gain proficiency with fine caltrops, allowing you to use them for attacks with improved caltrop effects. An attack with fine caltrops doesn't target a creature, but targets a 5-foot diameter circular area on the ground.

**SPECIAL RANGED WEAPONS**
Weapon|Cost|Dmg|Weight|Properties
------|----|---|------|----------
Fine Caltrops|5 sp| -- |1 lb.|Special, Thrown (40 ft.)

Any creature that enters the area of your fine caltrops while the caltrops remain on top of the ground must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Trap DC. Any creature who cannot see the caltrops (if they are scattered in dense foliage, obscuring mist, etc., it requires a Wisdom (Perception) check against your Trap DC to find them) has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature that is aware of the caltrops and chooses to move at half speed through the area (see PHB, page 151) still makes the saving throw, but with advantage. On a failed saving throw for fine caltrops, a creature takes piercing damage equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). On a successful saving throw, a creature takes no damage.

## Precision Planning
*3rd-level trapper feature*

You can use your Sneak Attack when one of your traps deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage to a creature. You can also your use your Sneak Attack when you deal damage with fine caltrops, but only up to a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) regaining all uses when you finish a short or long rest.

## Hidden Threats
*9th-level trapper feature*

You learn the secrets of hiding and detecting traps of all kinds. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect hidden doors, mechanisms, and traps, and your caltrops, fine caltrops, and traps that you arrange using your Trap Mastery feature grant enemies disadvantage on Perception checks made to detect them.

In addition, you gain the ability to completely ignore the effects of your own caltrops and fine caltrops. 

## Wide Spread
*13th-level trapper feature*

You learn how to make the most out of a handful of caltrops, throwing them wide but efficiently so that they cover a broader area. When you make an attack with fine caltrops, the diameter of the area they effect is 15 feet.

Also, when a trap you arranged with your Trap Mastery feature activates and targets one or two creatures, you can target an additional creature within 5 feet of one target as well, and when you arrange a trap that affects an area, you double the size of that area.

## Perfect Timing
*17th-level trapper feature*

You learn how to coordinate your strikes with your traps perfectly. You can now both deal damage normally with your Sneak Attack and deal Sneak Attack damage using your Precision Planning feature on the same turn, though you can still use each ability only once per turn.

In addition, when you deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature using your Precision Planning feature, you gain advantage on weapon attacks made against that creature until the end of that turn.

Finally, you can use Precision Planning an unlimited number of times without having to rest.
