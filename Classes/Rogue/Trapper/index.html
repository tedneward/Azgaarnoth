<p>There are those who will slide a blade into an enemy's ribs, those who would drip poison into their drinks, and then there are those who take the utmost pride in making the enemy's death look like an accident.

description = &quot;***Roguish Archetype: Trapper.*** There are those who will slide a blade into an enemy's ribs, those who would drip poison into their drinks, and then there are those who take the utmost pride in making the enemy's death look like an accident. Given just a little bit of time and materials, a Trapper can turn an hallway into a blood trough, a doorway into a portal to death, or a house into a morgue.&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="trap-mastery">Trap Mastery</h2>
<p><em>3rd-level trapper feature</em></p>
<p>You learn the secrets of arranging precision-perfect traps to catch your enemies in their most vulnerable moments. </p>
<p>You gain proficiency with your choice of either Alchemist's Supplies, Poisoner's Kit, or Tinker's Tools.</p>
<pre><code>def level3(npc):
    npc.proficiencies.append(choose(&quot;Choose: &quot;, [&quot;Alchemist's supplies&quot;, &quot;Poisoner's kit&quot;, &quot;Tinker's tools&quot;]))
</code></pre>
<p>You also learn how to create and arrange amazing traps with which to catch your enemies. Arranging a trap takes 1 minute of uninterrupted work, and to do so you must both have the trap's materials and meet the trap's requirements. If a trap's materials include a tool, proficiency is not required, and the tool is not expended in the making of the trap.</p>
<p>To place a trap in a lock, you can use a door or any other object that can lock, and you can choose whether the trap activates upon unlocking or upon opening. If not placed in a lock, a trap activates when a creature other than you moves within the activation range of the trap. When you arrange a trap, you can choose to reduce its activation range to a lower value. A trap will attempt to target as many creatures other than you as it can when it activates, preferring closer targets, but it will always target the activating creature. A trap will only activate once and then fall apart.</p>

If an enemy isn't aware of your trap's existence, it has disadvantage on saving throws to defend against the trap's activation effect. A foe can detect your traps by using an action to make a Wisdom (Perception) ability check against your Trap DC. Once a trap is detected, a creature can take an action on its turn to walk and act very carefully and become unable to trigger the trap by moving until the end of its turn. A creature who is aware of a trap can also use an action to touch the trap and make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) ability check against your Trap DC. The creature has disadvantage on this ability check. On a success, the creature disarms your trap and it falls apart harmlessly. On a failure, the creature activates the trap.&quot;)
