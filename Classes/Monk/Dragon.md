# Monastic Tradition: Way of the Dragon
The monks who follow the Way of the Dragon learn to channel their ki to emulate draconic power within their fighting styles.

Rumors swirl around these monks, usually around the idea that a dragon is at the head of a monastary studying the Way of the Dragon. Regardless of the truth of that, each Dragon monastery studies a particular dragon type, and that dragon's type will have an enormous sway over the monks of that monastary; not only on what disciplines they study, but on their actions within the wider world.

This monastic tradition is different from the [Way of the Ascendant Dragon](AscendantDragon.md), in that this tradition is one which studies dragonkind as a whole, rather than a particular species (within the chromatic or metallic spectrum). The Ascendant Dragons believe their style provides greater versatility, and thus, superior skill.

Dragon monks are often closely associated with the [Cult of the Wyrm](/Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md), largely because many of the Dragon monasteries are, in fact, run by Wyrmcult dragons. However, this does not mean all Dragon monks are evil--far from it. Many would be horrified to find they were in fact perpetrating the actions of evil. Nevertheless, Dragon tradition monks can often be found allied with the Wyrmcult, and as such frequently find themselves at odds with the [Knights of the Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md), at least at first.

## Dragon Disciple
When you choose this discipline at 3rd level, you learn draconic disciplines that teach you to channel your ki to harness draconic techniques. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it. 

You know the Dragon's Knowledge discipline, as well as one additional draconic discipline, which are detailed in the "Draconic Disciplines" section below. You learn an additional draconic discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

Whenever you learn a new draconic discipline, you can also replace one draconic discipline that you already know with a different discipline.

***Casting Draconic Spells***. Some draconic disciplines allow you to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.

Once you reach 5th level in this class. you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of a draconic discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level as dragon's breath does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 9th-level monk and use Dragon's Breath to cast dragon's breath, you can spend 4 ki points to cast it as a 3rd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 3 ki points plus 1).

The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.
