# Monastic Tradition: Way of Mercy
Monks of the Way of Mercy learn to manipulate the life force of others to bring aid to those in need. They are wandering physicians to the poor and hurt. However, to those beyond their help--whether ailing or evil--they bring a swift end as an act of mercy.

Monks of Mercy are revered everywhere they travel, and no sentient creature on Azgaarnoth will deliberately attack a monk of Mercy without extreme provocation. (In return, however, most creatures will also expect the same sort of pacifism out of a Mercy monk, and violations of that expectation can often turn extremely violent.) The monks maintain a monastery--what they call a *hospital*--in the capital of every nation of Azgaarnoth, and many Masters of Mercy travel with a small retinue of other Mercy monks as a sort of "traveling hospital" to the various villages, towns, cities, and holdings. The monks are also willing to take any sort--from the smallet kobold to the boldest giant--as an initiate, so long as they abide by the Law of Mercy.

## Hand of Healing
*3rd-level Way of Mercy feature*

Your mystical touch can mend wounds. As an action, you can spend 1 ki point to touch a creature and restore a number of hit points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.

When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the unarmed strikes with a use of this feature without spending a ki point for the healing.

## Hands of Harm
*3rd-level Way of Mercy feature*

You use your ki to inflict wounds. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 1 ki point to deal extra necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

## Physician's Touch
*6th-level Way of Mercy feature*

You can administer even greater cures with a touch, and if you feel it's necessary, you can use your knowledge to cause harm.

When you use Hand of Healing on a creature, you can also end one disease or one of the following conditions affecting the creature: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or stunned.

When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you can subject that creature to the poisoned condition until the end of your next turn.

## Flurry of Healing and Harm
*11th-level Way of Mercy feature*

You can now mete out a flurry of comfort and hurt. When you use Flurry of Blows, you can now replace each of the unarmed strikes with a use of your Hand of Healing, without spending ki points for the healing.

In addition, when you make an unarmed strike with Flurry of Blows, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without spending the ki point for Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only once per turn.

## Hand of Ultimate Mercy
*17th-level Way of Mercy feature*

Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As an action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 ki points. The creature then returns to life, regaining a number of hit points equal to 4d10 + your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died while subject to any of the following conditions, it revives with them removed: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, and stunned. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
