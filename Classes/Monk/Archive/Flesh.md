# Monastic Tradition: Way of Flesh
The Way of the Flesh teaches of the body as something which changes based on need. The corporeal form is only a shell, and that shell must serve the needs of the soul. The abilities of these monks sometimes engender fear or revulsion in onlookers, but merely reflect the monk's superior understanding of and mastery over their own forms.

## My Body, a Weapon
At 3rd level, you learn to twist your flesh into the right weapon for your current need. You can spend a ki point to change one or both of your hands into fleshy monk weapon(s) of your choice. This transformation lasts 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. Whilst transformed in this way, the affected limb(s) gain all qualities of the weapon they are mimicking, but you lose your fingers and thumbs. The weapons cannot be detached from your body short of permanently chopping off that body part.

## Morphing
At 3rd level, you can spend a ki point to render your body fluid until the end of your next turn, during which time you can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

## Remoulding
Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to change your appearance substantially. You can use a bonus action to cast alter self, requiring no components.

## Rupture
At 11th level, your form is malleable enough that it can recover from almost any wound. You can spend 3 ki points to accelerate your healing process. For the next hour, you regain 1 hit point at the start of each of your turns (10 hit points each minute). 

Your severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, this ability instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.

## Mitosis
At 17th level, your command of over your body reaches new heights, allowing you to create a copy of yourself as an action by splitting yourself in half. When you do so, you split your hit points and ki points between yourself and the clone, which otherwise shares all your statistics, obeys your telepathic commands and acts on your initiative. You cannot have more than one Mitosis clone at any one time.

After 1 hour, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points, the copy dissolves.
