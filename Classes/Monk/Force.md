# Monastic Tradition: Way of the Binding Force
Your monastic tradition centers around a mysterious and powerful force that binds together all living things. As a follower of this tradition, you learn to manipulate the binding force to manipulate the minds of others, move objects, or to wreak havoc upon your foes in combat. Monks of this tradition believe that the Force That Binds Us All is a force more powerful than even the gods, and that it guides and shapes the direction of the world is subtle ways. Their job, then, is to listen to the Will of the Binding Force (which they will often refer to as just "the Will"), and heed the guidance it offers on the path it wants the world to take ("the Way").

Some scholars believe that the Way of the Binding Force is an offshoot of [mystics](../Mystic.md) and their psionic abilities, others suggest that Force monks tap into the power of arcana (or divinity), while still others believe it to be an entirely different sort of power altogether. Force monks often travel alone, seeking to dispense justice in matters that find them, or sometimes taking on matters that they perceive require correction. Not openly good, but certainly not evil, the Way of the Binding Force almost seems Druidic in its belief system, yet, as Force monks will be quick to point out, "even Nature must find its Way within the Will of the Binding Force".

## Disciple of the Binding Force
*3rd-level Way of the Binding Force feature*

You learn magical disciplines that harness the power that interconnects all living things. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.

You know the Forceful Abilities discipline and one other force discipline of your choice. You learn one additional discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

Whenever you learn a new discipline, you can also replace one discipline that you already know with a different  discipline.

### Casting Discipline Spells
Some disciplines allow you to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.

Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of a discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as catapult does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Forceful Throw to cast [catapult](../../Magic/Spells/catapult.md), you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 ki points plus 1). The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.

**Spells and Ki Points**

Monk Levels|Maximum Ki Points for a Spell
-----------|-------------------
5th–8th|3
9th–12th|4
13th–16th|5
17th–20th|6
