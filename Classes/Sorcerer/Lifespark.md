# Sorcerous Origin: Lifespark
Life is a powerful source of magic. Those who have a gift for that spark know how to harvest it at precisely the proper moment, providing a boost to their spellcasting that many sorcerers envy.  

Most kingdoms forbid the practice of lifespark sorcery, since the heart of its power is consumptive and destructive, encouraging its practitioners to take life wantonly and for selfish purposes. Some lifespark sorcerers try to hew to a higher moral standard, only consuming the spark of evil creatures or in service to a greater good, but many others find the lifespark power intoxicating, and embrace the darkness that comes with its practice.























## Portent of Blood
Beginning at 1st level, when you choose this origin, you can select guidance when you learn a sorcerer cantrip.

## Prophetic Reflexes
At 1st level, when you cast a divination spell, you can choose a number of creatures you can see equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures gain a +1 bonus to initiative checks. This bonus lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. You cannot use the fea- ture again until you finish a rest.

## Life Spark
Starting at 6th level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon or spell attack, you capture a portion of its fleeting soul and forge 1 life spark. Once per turn, you can expend a life spark to gain a benefit depending on the nature of creature whose essence you captured.

You can hold a number of life sparks equal to your Constitution modifier. At the end of a long rest, any unspent life sparks fade into the great beyond.

Some life spark powers require your target to make a saving throw to resist its effects. Calculate the saving throw DC as follows: **Life Spark save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

**Aberration.** You can expend an aberration life spark as a bonus action to gain a +2 bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.

**Beast.** You can expend a beast life spark as an action to cast [speak with animals](../../Magic/Spells/speak-with-animals.md) without the expenditure of a spell slot.

**Celestial.** You can expend a celestial life spark as a bonus action to gain resistance to all damage until the end of your next turn.

**Dragon.** You can expend a dragon life spark to gain an advantage on your next saving throw. This advantage lasts until the end of your next turn.

**Elemental.** When you hit a creature with a weapon or spell attack, you can expend an elemental life spark to deal an extra 1d8 points of damage. The extra damage can be either bludgeoning or fire (your choice).

**Fey.** When you hit a creature with a weapon or spell attack, you can expend a fey life spark as a bonus action to beguile or frighten the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened (your choice) until the end of your next turn.

**Fiend.** You can expend a fiend life spark as a bonus action to gain resistance to fire damage until the end of your next turn.

**Giant.** You can expend a giant life spark to gain advantage to Strength checks until the end of your next turn.

**Monstrosity.** You can expend a monstrosity life spark as a bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + half your sorcerer level.

## Vessel of Ghosts
At 14th level, you can retain the fleeting essence contained within a life spark. At the end of a long rest, you can expend one or more hit dice. Instead of gaining hit points, you can prevent 1 life spark from disappearing with each hit die you expend.

## Wellspring of Life
At 14th level, the very presence of a life spark revitalizes your strength and well-being. If you possess at least one life spark at the end of a short rest, you or one other creature within 10 feet can regain hit points as if you expended 1 hit die.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again after a long rest.

## Shape Life Spark
When you achieve 18th level, you can manipulate the fleeting essence contained within a life spark. When you expend a life spark, you can benefit from any one of the listed life spark powers regardless of the creature's nature when you captured it.
