# Sorcerous Origin: Soulless
You don't exist. Not really. You were born without a soul, or that's what they tell you. It makes you special, but you don't feel any different...not that you have anything to compare it to. People have always treated you differently, as if there were nothing behind your eyes but darkness.

Your sorcerous blood can manifest in a number of peculiar ways:

1d6 | Soulless Bloodline Quirks
--- | -----------------------------
1 | Animals run away from you and won't come close unless forced
2 | Children scream and cry if you try and touch them
3 | You never dream. It's only darkness in there.
4 | Priests and clerics sometimes flinch away from you involuntarily
5 | You don't seem to age as fast as everyone else. You're not sure by how much.
6 | There's a shadow behind your eyes that intimidates people meeting you.

## Soulless Magic
You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Soulless Spells table. Each spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can't be replaced when you gain a level in this class.

Sorcerer Level | Soulless Spells
-------------- | ----------------
1st | unseen servant, dissonant whispers
3rd | pass without trace, invisibility
5th | nondetection, gaseous form
7th | dimension door, greater invisibility
9th | mislead, modify memory

## No Soul
Starting at 1st level, you are immune to any magic that would read your mind, affect your dreams or interact with your personality traits. You have no soul, and thus cannot trade it away to the devil or make any similar trade. You cannot be raised from the dead or become undead for any reason.

## Gone
Starting at 6th level, you can slip between the gaps in reality, becoming unreal for a moment. As an action, you spend 1 sorcery point to become invisible and intangible. You cannot cast any spells, move or take any actions whilst in this form. For the duration, no-one can remember you ever existed, and they rationalise away any evidence to the contrary. This effect lasts for 1 minute, then fades.

## I Would Not Stop for Death
Starting at 14th level, you can choose to ignore death - (you are, after all, not really alive). If you would die, you can spend 1 sorcery point to ignore the damage instance or effect which would have slain you. The cost of this ability increases permanently by 1 each time you use it, to a maximum of 20.

## The Cat Who Walked Alone
Starting at 18th level, you can move around during your Gone ability. You can move through walls and objects, but if your Gone ability ends while you are inside an object you are shunted to the nearest available empty space and you take 4d10 force damage.
