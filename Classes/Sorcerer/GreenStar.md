# Sorcerous Origin: Green Star of Ilhagos
The Green Star of Ilhagos, as it's referred to by those who have studied it, fell to the ground in the first age of the world, shattering and sending splinters all across the world.The Green Star Adepts infuse their bodies with the essence of this enchanted meteorite, changing themselves to living foci to channel their magical power.

Your power draws from this gem somehow; you or your ancestors perhaps were near when it shattered, releasing great power into the world, or you were born near the presence of a sliver. Whatever the cause, the jade power dwells within you.

## Green Star Spells
Starting at 1st level, your tie to the Star changes your mind in subtle but profound ways. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Green Star Spells table. The spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can't be replaced when you gain a level in this class.

## Jade Skin
At 1st level, your skin thickens and hardens, with tiny shards of emerald crystals growing where calluses and scars would mark your skin. While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

Additionally, as a bonus action, you can make your emerald crystals glow, which sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. You can dismiss this effect at will.

## Jade Flame
Starting at 1st level, you are able to call forth power of the Star.

As a bonus action, you magically wreathe parts of yourself in swirling fire. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

* You shed bright green light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

* Your unarmed attacks deal 1d4 damage. This damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and finally 1d10 at 18th level.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Jade Spark
Starting at 6th level, the jade energy within you grows protective. Your body shape changes, with hard edged planes forming across your skin. A green hue coats your body from head to toe. In the face of defeat, it surges outward to preserve you in a fiery roar.

If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to draw on the shard of the Green Star. You are instead reduced to 1 hit point, and each creature within 10 feet of you takes fire damage equal to half your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Nourishing Fire
Starting at 14th level, contact with the Green Star comforts and soothes you. When you expend a spell slot while holding any emerald worth more than 50gp, you regain hit points equal to twice the slot's level + your Charisma modifier.

## Emerald Perfection
Starting at 18th level, your appearance looks like a sculpture of carved emeralds. You no longer need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, and you are immune to poison damage and disease. You do not suffer from exhaustion and you are immune to the deafened, incapacitated, petrified, poisoned, stunned, and unconscious conditions.
