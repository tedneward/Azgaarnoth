# Sorcerous Origin: Channeler
Most who bear the gift of channeling never have time or opportunity to develop those skills, due to destroying themselves early on or being forced to live on the run from those who seek to exploit them. You, however, have undertaken careful practice to grow your talents into magical mastery. You know that, in time, those who can discipline the power of channeling are able to hone their talent into true sorcery and fantastic abilities that most dabblers can only dream of.

## Channel Spells
At 1st level when you choose this sorcerous origin, you gain a set of abilities that are fueled by special dice called channeling dice.

**Channeling Dice.** You have two channeling dice, which are d8s. A channeling die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended channeling dice when you finish a long rest. You gain a third channeling die at 5th level, a fourth at 11th level, and a fifth at 17th level. At 11th level, your channeling dice become d10s instead of d8s; at 17th level, they become d12s. If you are in an area where spells are suppressed or cannot be cast (such as an antimagic field spell), you cannot use channeling dice.

**Expending Multiple Channeling Dice.** The maximum number of channeling dice you can spend each turn is equal to your proficiency bonus. Whenever you spend 2 or more channeling dice in a single turn, you must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC equal to 15 + the number of channeling dice spent. If you fail, you and any creatures within 10 feet of you take force damage equal to your sorcerer level.

**Using Channeling Dice.** You can expend channeling dice to gain a number of different benefits:
* When you take cold damage or damage from a spell, you can use your reaction to expend 1 or more channeling dice and regain hit points equal to the total number rolled on your channeling dice.
* When you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to expend 1 or more channeling dice in an attempt to melt or burn the projectile before it strikes. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by your level + your total channeling dice roll. If you reduce the damage to zero, the projectile is assumed to have been consumed by flame before it even reached you.
* Whenever you inflict fire damage with a spell or cantrip, you can use your bonus action to expend 1 or more channeling dice to inflict extra damage against one target of that fire damage (even if that target took no fire damage due to immunity or a similar effect). The target takes force damage equal to your total channeling dice roll, and you can push the target up to 10 feet away from you. When you reach 5th level, you can choose a second target (if possible). At 11th level, you can choose a total of three targets; at 17th level, the total number of targets you can choose increases to four.
* As an action, you can expend 1 or more channeling dice to heal a creature you touch for a number of hit points equal to half your total channeling dice roll.
* As an action, you can expend 1 channeling die to cast detect magic.
channeling Radiance. Whenever you spend 1 or more channeling dice, until the end of your next turn you can cast the produce flame cantrip at will, and you shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you spend 4 or more channeling dice at once, these radii are doubled.

**Inner Warmth.** As long as you have at least one unexpended channeling die remaining, you are considered naturally adapted to cold climates, and you have the ability to start fires with a touch. As an action, you can magically ignite a flammable object you touch with your hand--an object such as a torch, a piece of tinder, or the hem of drapes.

## Absorb Magic
At 6th level, when you roll a saving throw against a spell, you can use your reaction to expend 1 or more channeling dice and gain advantage on that saving throw. You then roll your channeling dice and regain hit points equal to half the total number rolled.

In addition, whenever you successfully end one or more spell effects using a spell you cast with a sorcerer spell slot (such as counterspell or dispel magic), you regain 1 expended channeling die.

Finally, as a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to regain 1 expended channeling die, or you can expend 2 channeling dice to regain 1 spent sorcery point.

## Channeling Mastery
At 14th level, your powerful mastery of channeling grants you a number of benefits:
* When you expend a spell slot to cast a spell that includes a fire damage roll, the roll gains a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier.
* Whenever you expend 1 or more channeling dice, you gain resistance to cold damage and fire damage for 1 minute, and the next creature that hits you with a melee attack or touches you before the end of your next turn takes fire damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

## Crown of Fire
At 18th level, you can manifest the legendary crown of fire. As a bonus action, you magically wreathe your head in a halo of channeling that exudes heat and light. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
* You have resistance to cold damage, fire damage, radiant damage, and necrotic damage, and resistance to damage from spells.
* You gain a fly speed of 40 feet. You can hover when flying with this feature.
* You shed bright light in a 100-foot radius and dim light for an additional 100 feet.
* Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
