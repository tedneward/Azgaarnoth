# Sorcerous Origin: Eldar Bloodline
Bloodlines are a powerful source of magic. Most kingdoms forbid the practice of blood sorcery since many believe it relies on the strength of a noble lineage--that of an Eldar who, against all laws and taboos, chose to mingle his blood with that of a human, providing powerful magic through a bloodline gift that often is as much curse as it is wondrous. Whether the rumors and suspicions are true are unknown; what is known is that certain individuals demonstrate a deep power available to only a few.

Nevertheless, kings and queens, along with great tribal chieftains, believe it a sinister form of blood magic and hunt the purveyors with zeal. On the other hand, several serve as advisors to immoral rulers. The depraved sovereigns often surround themselves with unwitting courtiers of strong heritage as a source for their blood sorcerer.

## Portent of Blood
Beginning at 1st level, when you choose this origin, you can select guidance when you learn a sorcerer cantrip.

## Prophetic Reflexes
At 1st level, when you cast a divination spell, you can choose a number of creatures you can see equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures gain a +1 bonus to initiative checks. This bonus lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest. You cannot use the fea- ture again until you finish a rest.

## Life Spark
Starting at 6th level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon or spell attack, you capture a portion of its fleeting soul and forge 1 life spark. Once per turn, you can expend a life spark to gain a benefit depending on the nature of creature whose essence you captured.

You can hold a number of life sparks equal to your Constitution modifier. At the end of a long rest, any unspent life sparks fade into the great beyond.

Some life spark powers require your target to make a saving throw to resist its effects. Calculate the saving throw DC as follows:

        **Life Spark save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

**Aberration.** You can expend an aberration life spark as a bonus action to gain a +2 bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.

**Beast.** You can expend a beast life spark as an action to cast speak with animals without the expendi-
ture of a spell slot.

**Celestial.** You can expend a celestial life spark as a bonus action to gain resistance to all damage until the end of your next turn.

**Dragon.** You can expend a dragon life spark to gain an advantage on your next saving throw. This advantage lasts until the end of your next turn.

**Elemental.** When you hit a creature with a weapon or spell attack, you can expend an elemental life spark to deal an extra 1d8 points of damage. The extra damage can be either bludgeoning or fire (your choice).

**Fey.** When you hit a creature with a weapon or spell attack, you can expend a fey life spark as a bonus action to beguile or frighten the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened (your choice) until the end of your next turn.

**Fiend.** You can expend a fiend life spark as a bonus action to gain resistance to fire damage until the end of your next turn.

**Giant.** You can expend a giant life spark to gain advantage to Strength checks until the end of your next turn.

**Humanoid.** You can expend a humanoid life spark as an action to cast augury without expending a spell slot or material components

**Monstrosity.** You can expend a monstrosity life spark as a bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + half your sorcerer level.

## Vessel of Ghosts
At 14th level, you can retain the fleeting essence contained within a life spark. At the end of a long rest, you can expend one or more hit dice. Instead of gaining hit points, you can prevent 1 life spark from disappearing with each hit die you expend.

## Wellspring of Life
At 14th level, the very presence of a life spark revitalizes your strength and well-being. If you possess at least one life spark at the end of a short rest, you or one other creature within 10 feet can regain hit points as if you expended 1 hit die.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again after a long rest.

## Shape Life Spark
When you achieve 18th level, you can manipulate the fleeting essence contained within a life spark. When you expend a life spark, you can benefit from any one of the listed life spark powers regardless of the creature's nature when you captured it.
