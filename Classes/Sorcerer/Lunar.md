# Sorcerous Origin: Lunar Embodiment
Lunar sorcerers find their powers tied deeply to the lunar cycle and its different phases; like a moon itself, their power changes in phases, sometimes bringing the brightness and light found during a full moon, other times the deepest darkness of night that only comes when the moon is entirely hidden.

You or someone from your lineage has been exposed to the concentrated magic of the moon (or moons) of your world, imbuing you with lunar magic. Perhaps your ancestor was involved in a druidic ritual involving an eclipse, or maybe a mystical fragment of a moon crashed near you. Sometimes, the very conjunction of steallar bodies creates waves of force that, channeled through the moon's light, deeply affects those bathed in its light. However you came to have your magic, your connection to the moon is obvious when you cast sorcerer spells--perhaps making your pupils glow with the color of a moon from your world, causing spectral manifestations of lunar phases to orbit you, or some other effect.

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Lunar Spells table. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

**Lunar Spells**

Sorcerer Level | Full Moon Spells | New Moon Spells | Crescent Moon Spells
-------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | --------------------
1st | Shield | Ray of Sickness | Color Spray
3rd | Lesser Restoration | Blindness/Deafness | Alter Self
5th | Dispel Magic | Vampiric Touch | Phantom Steed
7th | Death Ward | Confusion | Hallucinatory Terrain
9th | Rary's Telepathic Bond | Hold Monster | Mislead

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can choose what lunar phase manifests its power through your magic: Full Moon, New Moon, or Crescent Moon. While in the chosen phase, you can cast one 1st-level spell of the associated phase in the Lunar Spells table once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Moon Fire
Starting at 1st level, you can call down the radiant light of the moon on command. You learn the Sacred Flame spell, which doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer cantrips you know. When you cast the spell, you can target one creature as normal or target two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other.

## Lunar Boons
Starting at 6th level, the current phase of your Lunar Embodiment can affect your Metamagic feature. Each Lunar Embodiment phase is associated with certain schools of magic, as shown here:

**Full Moon.** Abjuration and Divination spells

**New Moon.** Evocation and Necromancy spells

**Crescent Moon.** Divination and Transmutation spells

Whenever you use Metamagic on a spell of a school of magic associated with your current Lunar Embodiment phase, you can reduce the sorcery points spent by 1 (minimum 0). You can reduce the sorcery points spent for your Metamagic a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest

## Waxing and Waning
Starting at 6th level, you gain greater control over the phases of your lunar magic. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change your current Lunar Embodiment phase for a different one.

You can now cast one 1st-level spell from each lunar phase of the Lunar Spells table once without expending a spell slot, provided your current phase is the same as the lunar phase spell. Once you cast a lunar phase spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Lunar Empowerment
Starting at 14th level, the power of a lunar phase saturates your being. While you are in a Lunar Embodiment phase, you also gain the following benefit associated with that phase:

**Full Moon:** You can use a bonus action to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet or to douse the light. In addition, you and creatures of your choice have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks while within the bright light you shed.

**New Moon:** You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In addition, while you are entirely in darkness, attack rolls have disadvantage against you.

**Crescent Moon:** You have resistance to necrotic and radiant damage.

## Lunar Phenomenon
At 18th level, as a bonus action, you can tap into a special power of your current Lunar Embodiment phase. Alternatively, as part of the bonus action you take to change your lunar phase using the Waxing and Waning feature, you can immediately use the power of the lunar phase you are entering:

**Full Moon:** You radiate moonlight for a moment. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn. In addition, one creature of your choice in that area regains 3d8 hit points.

**New Moon:** You momentarily emanate gloom. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 3d10 necrotic damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. In addition, you become invisible until the end of your next turn, or until immediately after you make an attack or cast a spell.

**Crescent Moon:** You can magically teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of yourself. You can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. That creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of your destination space. In addition, you and that creature gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.

Once you use one of these bonus action benefits, you can’t use that benefit again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.
