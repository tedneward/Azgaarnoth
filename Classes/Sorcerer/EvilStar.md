# Sorcerous Origin: Evil Star
You were born under an evil star. That’s what people told you, even as they crossed to other side of the street and made a sign against bad magic. Your blood carries the blighted power of the far off stars, cold and burning, deathly givers of life.

The starlight murmurs in your blood can manifest in a number of peculiar ways:
1d6 | Evil Star Bloodline Quirks
--- | ------------------------
1 | Your pupils constantly shimmer and flicker like a faraway star.
2 | Your skin is covered with birthmarks scattered like constellations.
3 | When you get angry or sad, you begin to radiate a bleak chill from your exposed skin.
4 | You shine with a cruel dim white or blue light when in total darkness.
5 | You sometimes speak in Deep Speech without realising it.
6 | Your blood is coloured like obsidian, and is flecked with motes of starlight.

## Star Magic
You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Star Spells table. Each spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can’t be replaced when you gain a level in this class.

Level | Star Spells
----- | -------------
1st | armor of agathys, arms of hadar
3rd | moonbeam, skywrite
5th | hunger of hadar, bestow curse
7th | fire shield, shadow of moil*
9th | flame strike, contact other plane

## Dread Star
Starting at first level, you can use an action to conjure an orb of sinister light around your hand. This orb sheds bright light out to 30 feet, and dim light for a further 30 feet. The light is distracting and beguiling - you are considered to have light cover against melee attacks and medium cover from ranged attacks, as long as the attacker relies on sight. The orb lasts for 1 minute before fading, and you must finish a short rest before using this ability again.

## Sign of Ill Omen
Starting at 6th level, you may call on your arts to curse your enemies, turning their happiness to ashes. As an action, you spend 3 sorcery points and target a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, which must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become cursed. A cursed creature becomes hounded by inconveniences and unfortunate coincidences, suffering disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws they make until the curse is lifted.

## Thirteen Baleful Stars
Starting at 14th level, when you use your Dread Star ability you can conjure 13 stars which orbit around you in a dizzying display, increasing the bright light radius to 120 feet, dispelling magical darkness in the area. Creatures which look directly at you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or become blinded until the end of their next turn.

## Thief of Five Fates
Starting at 18th level, your Sign of Ill Omen increases in power. When a creature affected by your Sign of Ill Omen scores a critical hit on an attack roll, that critical hit becomes a miss instead. When a creature misses its 5th roll in this way, the curse ends on that creature.
