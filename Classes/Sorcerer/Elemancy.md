# Sorcerous Origin: Elemancy (Pyromancy)
Your innate magic manifests in fire. You are your fire, and your fire is you.

> You could easily create mages of other elements by swapping out "fire" for damage and resistance of other elements. For instance, you could create a cryomancer by replacing fire with cold, or an electromancer by replacing fire with lightning. It's rumored that there are even some sorcerous necrotic elemancers, though this has never been confirmed among any of the mage schools.

> Note: Elemancy sorcerers have an element in the blood; this is different from the [FireSpeakers](FireSpeaker.md), who lack the element in the blood, but can hear the call of creatures from the plane. They share some characteristics--and will often find comfort in each others' company--but their relationship to the element is vastly different.

## Heart of Fire
At 1st level, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire damage, fiery magic erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take fire damage equal to half your sorcerer level (minimum of 1).

## Fire in the Veins
At 6th level, you gain resistance to fire damage. In addition, spells you cast ignore resistance to fire damage.

## Pyromancer's Fury
Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal fire damage to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level, and ignores resistance to fire damage.

## Fiery Soul
At 18th level, you gain immunity to fire damage. In addition, any spell or effect you create ignores resistance to fire damage and treats immunity to fire damage as resistance to fire damage.
