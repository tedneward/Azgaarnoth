# Divine Domain: Zeal
The Zeal domain is not so much a concept owned by a deity, but the fervor with which a worshiper evangelizes their divine being's message or portfolio; as a result any cleric can be a zealot, but to do so is to take the messages of the deity as your core identity.

This domain is available to clerics of the [Kaevarian Church](../../Religions/KaevarianChurch.md), ...

## Domain Spells
Starting at 1st level, you gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Unity Domain Spells table. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

## Bonus Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.

## Priest of Zeal
From 1st level, your god delivers bolts of inspiration to you while you are engaged in battle. When you use the Attack action, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Channel Divinity: Consuming Fervor
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to channel your zeal into unchecked ferocity.

When you roll fire or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage instead of rolling.

## Resounding Strike
At 6th level, when you deal thunder damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can also push it up to 10 feet away from you.

## Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

## Blaze of Glory
Starting at 17th level, you can delay death for an instant to perform a final heroic act.

When you are reduced to 0 hit points by an attacker you can see, even if you would be killed outright, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed toward the attacker and make one melee weapon attack against it, as long as the movement brings it within your reach. You make this attack with advantage. If the attack hits, the creature takes an extra 5d10 fire damage and an extra 5d10 damage of the weapon's type. You then fall unconscious and begin making death saving throws as normal, or you die if the damage you took would have killed you outright.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
