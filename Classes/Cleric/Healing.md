# Divine Domain: Healing
Gods of healing & medicine offer guidance to those who wish to rid the world of suffering. They reward compassion and dedication with guidance and intervention and bless their healers with magic to help save lives. Healing temples are often sought out when doctors' surgeries are unavailable. Followers of such deities can be found throughout the world and they come from all walks of life. Many choose to study Medicine in a more direct path and can attention that way, others serve in temples and act as a vessel for the Gods themselves. Some are blessed from a young age with the miraculous healing abilities, hand picked by their deity to do great things in the years to come.

## Gifted Healer
*1st-level Healing Domain feature*

Whenever you use a spell to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier times the level of the spell cast.

If you've selected proficiency in Medicine, you gain Expertise in this field.

In addition, you learn the spare the dying cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. 

## Channel Divinity: Preventative Measures
*2nd-level Healing Domain feature*

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to protect others from potential threats. Choose an ally within 30 feet of yourself to be granted immunity to poison, diseases and curses for a total of 1 minute.

You can use this one per long rest.

## Divine Diagnosis
*2nd-level Healing Domain feature*

Starting from 2nd level you gain the ability to magically detect and diagnose ailments you encounter. As an action you can present your holy symbol and allow it to guide you towards a hidden source of poison, diseases or illness within 60 feet that isn't protected from divination magic. The sense does not inform you about the nature of the ailment you are tracking.

If you are diagnosing a patient and make physical contact you will be able to detect the exact nature, down to the name and the side effects, of any poison, illness or curse that is ailing them. You have advantage on any check in recalling further information. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## A Friend in Need...
*6th-level Healing Domain feature*

When you or an ally you can see within 30 feet requires a Constitution save as a reaction you can grant a blessing that gives advantage. If saved successfully that creature will become immune to that threat for 1 hour.

This can only be used once before requiring a short rest.

## Protect the Healer!
*8th-level Healing Domain feature*

As a reaction you can subtract your Wisdom modifier total from an attack roll made against you. 

This can be used twice per long rest.

## Divine Restoration
*17th-level Healing Domain feature*

As your power grows you begin to channel Divine Light in such a way that Material and Somatic components are no longer needed when using the spell Revivy, Raise the Dead or Resurrection.
