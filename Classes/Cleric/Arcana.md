# Divine Domain: Arcana

## Domain Spells
*1st-level Arcana Domain feature* 

Starting at 1st level, you gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Unity Domain Spells table. See the Arcana Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

**Arcana Domain Spells**
Cleric Level |	Spells
------------ | -----
1st |	Detect Magic, Magic Missile
3rd	| Magic Weapon, Nystul's Magic Aura
5th	| Dispel Magic, Magic Circle
7th	| Arcane Eye, Leomund's Secret Chest
9th	| Planar Binding, Teleportation Circle

## Arcane Initiate
*1st-level Arcana Domain feature* 

You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill, and you gain two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. For you, these cantrips count as cleric cantrips.

## Channel Divinity: Arcane Abjuration
*2nd-level Arcana Domain feature* 

You can use your Channel Divinity to abjure otherworldly creatures.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice that is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the Banishment spell, no concentration required) if it isn't on its plane of origin and its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown on the Arcane Banishment table.

**Arcane Banishment**
Cleric Level |	Banishes Creatures of CR...
------------ | --------------------------
5th | 1/2 or lower
8th	| 1 or lower
11th | 2 or lower
14th | 3 or lower
17th | 4 or lower

## Spell Breaker
*6th-level Arcana Domain feature* 

When you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.

## Potent Spellcasting
*8th-level Arcana Domain feature* 

You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

## Arcane Mastery
*17th-level Arcana Domain feature* 

You choose four spells from the wizard spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of domain spells. Like your other domain spells, they are always prepared and count as cleric spells for you.
