# Divine Domain: Sea
Clerics who serve deities of the sea act as both guides and guardians. The ocean is one of the most terrifying places in existence, due to what lies both above and below the water's surface. Clerics of the sea deities bring peace to sailors and calm the wrath of the waves.

This domain is available to clerics of the [Kaevarian Church](../../Religions/KaevarianChurch.md), ...

## Bonus Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.

## Wayfaring Worshiper
Starting at 1st level, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. You also learn the shape water cantrip, or one other cleric cantrip if you already knew it.

## Channel Divinity: Rising Tide
At 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to summon a thrashing tide in battle.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and a raging torrent appears around you. The torrent is centered on you, has a 30ft radius, and is filled with pouring rain and crashing waves. The sphere moves with you, and it lasts for 1 minute or until you fall unconscious or die. The torrent is difficult terrain, and ranged attack rolls have disadvantage.

You can designate a number of creatures up to your proficiency bonus that are immune to the torrent's effects.

This effect works underwater, as the area becomes a whirlpool.

## Snatching Undertow
At 6th level, you can create an overpowering current that pulls your foes down. As a bonus action, you can force a number of creatures up to your Wisdom modifier that are in your rising tide to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they are knocked prone.

If a target is submerged, when you use this ability, their movement speed becomes 0 until the end of their next turn.

## Prayers of the Deep
Also at 6th level, you can breathe air and water, and gain resistance to cold damage.

## Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

## Wrath of the Sea
At 17th level, you call forth the rage of the ocean to devour your enemies. When a hostile creature enters your torrent for the first time on a turn, or starts its turn there, they take cold damage equal to half your Cleric level.
