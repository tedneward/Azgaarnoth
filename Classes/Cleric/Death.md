# Divine Domain: Death
This domain is available to clerics of the [Kaevarian Church](../../Religions/KaevarianChurch.md), [Arawn](../../Religions/Pantheon/Arawn.md), ...

## Domain Spells
*1st-level Death Domain feature* 

You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Death Domain Spells table. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
