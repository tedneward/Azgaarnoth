# Divine Domain: Hearth
These Clerics are typically Champions of the home. They serve their community and are deeply respected by peasants and Nobles alike.  A hearth Cleric may serve the families of the community through counseling, divine blessings and direct defense if need be. These Clerics view adventures as service to their god by serving their allies and the communities they might happen upon.  A hearth cleric might serve in halfling village, a farming village, or you might find one on the battlefield with a group of Orc raiders protecting his tribe.

The hearth Cleric focuses on prevention and mitigation more than after the fact healing.

## Divine Strike: Those in Need
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to add 1d8 radiance damage to an allies next attack that you can see within 30'. An arc of white light strikes the allies weapon and it glows until the ally attacks or the end of their next turn whichever comes first.  When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
