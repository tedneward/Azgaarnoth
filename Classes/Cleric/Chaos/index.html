<h1 id="divine-domain-chaos">Divine Domain: Chaos</h1>
<p>Chaos is the opposite of order, and so gods of chaos are opposed to stasis, preservation, and structure in almost all things. Deities of chaos are often unpredictable, but they usually favor change and transformation whenever possible, altering the status quo using both the forces of destruction and renewal. Some gods of chaos (Loki, The Traveler, Maglubiyet, Xenagos) are mischief-makers that delight in any deception that causes upheaval. Many of them (Sirrion, Thassa, Tzeentch) are masters of change itself, whether that change is manmade, natural and un-controllable, or sudden and magical. There are deities that see change and chaos as aspects of luck (Tymora), while a few represent the inevitable chaotic destruction of entropy and disaster (Tharizdun).</p>
<p>Clerics of the Chaos Domain often aspire to be just as unpredictable as their deity. They work to abolish every status quo and upset every unquestioned norm.</p>

On a failed saving throw, a target takes lightning damage equal to 2d6 + {npc.levels(spellcasting.casterclass)}, and until the end of its next turn, it can't take reactions and it has disadvantage on attack rolls. On a successful saving throw, a target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. **7:** Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC {8 + npc.proficiencybonus() + npc.WISbonus()}) or else it must use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against one creature of your choice within its reach, dealing {npc.levels(spellcasting.casterclass)} extra damage. **8:** Up to three creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw (DC {8 + npc.proficiencybonus() + npc.WISbonus()}). On a failed saving throw, a creature is transformed into a Small object chosen by the DM (such as a chair or a potted plant) until the end of its next turn. While transformed, it is stunned and it can't speak. If it takes damage, the transformation ends immediately. **9:** One willing creature that you can see within 60 feet of you regains 1d6 + {2 * npc.levels(spellcasting.casterclass)} hit points. Also, you can teleport the target up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see within 60 feet of you, and until the end of its next turn, it has advantage on saving throws and enemies have disadvantage on attacks against it. **10:** One creature that you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it takes 3d6 + {2 * npc.levels(spellcasting.casterclass)} cold damage and its speed is reduced to 0 feet until the end of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, it takes half as much damage and its speed isn't reduced.&quot;))

<h2 id="inspired-chaos">Inspired Chaos</h2>
<p><em>6th-level Chaos Domain feature</em></p>
<p>Your deity grants you a measure of control over the chaos you receive from it. When you would roll a d10 for your Wild Blessing feature, you roll two d10s instead and choose which result to use. If both dice roll the same result, you choose the effect from the table.</p>
<h2 id="divine-strike">Divine Strike</h2>
<p><em>8th-level Chaos Domain feature</em></p>
<p>You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>
<p>The type of this extra damage is based on the result of the d8. Starting at 14th level, you choose which d8 to use to determine the damage type. If both d8s roll the same result, you instead choose a type from the table.</p>

<p><em>17th-level Chaos Domain feature</em></p>
<p>You gain the ability to alter fate and control chaos directly. Whenever you use your Wild Blessing feature, you can choose the effect from the table instead of rolling.</p>
<p>In addition, when you use your Channel Divinity feature, you can cause one spell of 3rd-level or lower that is affecting you or a willing creature that you can see within 30 feet of you to stop affecting that creature and instead start affecting a different willing creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet.</p>
<p>Once you transform a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
