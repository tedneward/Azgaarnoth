# Divine Domain: Song Domain
Few gods truly take on the domain of song as their primary domain, for it is a domain based on spreading the influence of a deity that the cleric worships, with tunes about the servants and deeds of the god. However, gods of music and stories, such as Apollo, Odin, Lliira, and Milil, are more likely to encourage their followers to spread their influence through song. Many of these deities encourage their clerics to go to homes caroling about the good path their deity can set the worried people on, and make their lives greater as a result.

This domain is available to clergy of [Milil](../../Religions/Pantheon/Milil.md), ....

Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain, at 1st level, you gain proficiency in Performance, and one musical instrument of your choice.

Godly Gospel
Also, at 1st level, as a bonus action you can play a tune that invokes imagery of your god, blessing one creature of your choice within 60 feet that can hear you. That creature gains one gospel die, a d4.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the gospel die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the gospel die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one gospel die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Channel Divinity: Respite's Symphony
Beginning at 2nd level, over the course of a minute, you can play a short song using your Channel Divinity that allows your allies to feel rested. Up to six creatures that heard your song (including yourself) can expend hit dice to restore hit points as though through a short rest, to a maximum amount of hit dice equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of 1 hit die).

Improved Godly Gospel
Starting at 6th level, your gospel die is now a d6, and you regain all expended gospel dice at the end of a short or long rest.

Potent Spellcasting
At 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

Inspiring Concert
By 17th level, the melodies you play can turn the tide in any fight. As an action, you can begin playing a divine concert, which lasts for 1 minute, or until your lose your concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). When you first begin the concert, and at the start of each of your turns for the concert's duration, you can choose up to six creatures within 60 feet of yourself that can hear you. Each of those creatures gains a gospel die, which is a d8.

After using this feature, you must take a long rest before doing so, again.
