# Divine Domain: Unity
A sense of oneness shines at the heart of healthy communities, whether bound together by friendship, blood, faith, or some other uniting force. The gods of unity deepen such bonds and delight in their strength.

Clerics of these gods preside over marriages and other familial bonding customs, but they also nurture the emotional bonds of friendship and camaraderie. Their divine blessings bolster and protect allies in battle through these deep bonds and turn aside malign influences.

This is a domain granted by [the Almalzish tradition](../../Religions/AlUma.md#almalzish-cleric),the [Kaevarian Church](../../Religions/KaevarianChurch.md), [Trinitarians who worship Sor](../../Religions/Trinitarian.md#sor), [Heironeous](../../Religions/Pantheon/Heironeous.md), [Maglubiyet](../../Religions/Pantheon/Maglubiyet.md), ...

## Domain Spells
Starting at 1st level, you gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Unity Domain Spells table. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

## Emboldening Bond
Starting at 1st level, you can forge an empowering bond between allies. As an action, you can choose two willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of you (this can include yourself) and create a magical bond between them. While either bonded creature is within 30 feet of the other, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the d4 no more than once per turn. The bond lasts for 1 hour or until you use this feature again.

You can use this feature once, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. You can also expend a spell slot to use the feature again.

## Channel Divinity: Shared Burden
Starting at 2nd, level, you can use your Channel Divinity to protect your allies through the strength of your shared bonds.
When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to choose a number of other willing creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature). Distribute the damage taken between the original target and the chosen creatures. Each creature must take at least 1 damage. Apply any damage resistance or vulnerability of the creatures involved after you distribute the damage.

## Protective Bond
Starting at 6th level, the bond you forge between people shields them from harm. While either creature chosen for your Emboldening Bond feature is within 30 feet of the other, the creature can use its reaction to grant resistance to all damage to the other creature when that other creature takes damage. This resistance lasts until the end of the current turn.

## Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

## Enduring Unity
Starting at 17th level, the bonds you create endure across vast distances. Creatures affected by your Emboldening Bond feature gain its benefits, as well as those of your Protective Bond feature, while they are on the same plane of existence as each other.

Additionally, when a creature chosen for your Emboldening Bond is reduced to 0 hit points, their bonded partner gains the following benefits for 1 minute, or until the creature regains at least 1 hit point:
* The creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws
* The creature gains resistance to all damage
* As an action, the creature can touch their bonded partner to expend and roll any number of Hit Dice. Their bonded partner regains a number of hit points equal to the total rolled.
