# Divine Domain: Air
Free-willed and adventurous, these Clerics worship the deities of the Air, always letting the ever-flowing winds guide them in their lives.

## Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the Gust cantrip if you don't already know it. This cantrip counts as a cleric cantrip for you, but it doesn't count against the number of cleric cantrips you know.

## Domain Spells
You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Air Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.
