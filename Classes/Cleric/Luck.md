# Divine Domain: Luck
The gods of luck and fortune have many followers, as so many mortals seek good luck and easy fortune. These deities rarely take sides, weighing weal and woe (mostly) fairly for all. Some are benevolent, especially favoring those who leave tokens of chance at their shrines. Clerics of luck often make decisions based on a coin flip or dice roll leaving tough choices to their deity, and preaching that life is always unpredictable.

## Domain Spells
Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
