# Divine Domain: Hunt
Gods of the hunt expect their followers to not only respect the natural world, but to master it. They may revel in the pleasure of hunting and killing a target, or they may see it as a grim necessity of survival. Gods with the hunt domain include Artemis, Silvanus, Sobek, Odin, and Uller.
