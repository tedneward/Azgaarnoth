# Divine Domain: Night
The night is not something to be feared. Many who ill-understand the nature of the night consider it to be a time of darkness and horror, but the night's sky is full of illuminated wonders. The night is a time of rest for mortals, bringing with it solace from the day's toils, and a comforting shadow in which the cares of the waking world drift away into nothing. Gods of this domain include Shar, Zehir, Selune and [Tiamat](../../Religions/Pantheon/Tiamat.md).

## Domain spells
You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Night Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

**Night Domain Spells**

Cleric Level | Night Domain Spells
------------ | -------------------
1st | sanctuary, sleep
3rd | calm emotions, darkness
5th | beacon of hope, slow
7th | guardian of faith, shadow of moil
9th | dream, modify memory

## Soothing Touch
At 1st level, you can take away the sufferings and joys of others, consigning them to sweet oblivion. As an action, you can touch a willing creature and choose a single Personality Trait, Ideal, Flaw or Bond that creature possesses, suppressing it indefinitely. The creature forgets they ever possessed the suppressed trait, and you can restore it to them as an action. A remove curse spell or similar magic also restores the suppressed trait. You can only suppress a single trait in any one creature.

## Channel Divinity: Everslumber
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to call on the quiescent powers of night. As an action, you present your holy symbol and all lights (magical or otherwise) within 30 feet of you are extinguished. In addition, creatures within the radius must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC or fall into a magical slumber, falling unconscious until 1 hour passes, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by this ability.

## Sweet dreams
At 6th level, your mere presence wards off the dark things which stalk the minds of sleeping mortals. Creatures sleeping within 30 feet of you are immune to any spells or magic that would tamper with or interfere with their sleep such as the dream spell, or abilities that would prevent their gaining the benefits of a rest, such as a Night Hag's nightmare haunting.

## Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

## Spindle Curse
Starting at 17th level, you Channel Divinity can be used to affect an area as wide as 1 mile in diameter, sending entire towns to sleep.
