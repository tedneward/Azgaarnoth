# Divine Domain: Illusion
Life is illusion. Reality is subjective. Senses are trustworthy only as far as they can be verified and triple-checked. As a cleric of this domain you will become harder and harder to pin and track down and eventually be able to hide your allies.

This domain is available to followers of [Melil](../../Religions/Pantheon/Milil.md), [the Traceless](../../Religions/Pantheon/Traceless.md), ...

## Domain Spells
As a Cleric of Illusion, you gain the following Domain spells at the appropriate levels. Domain spells are always considered prepared and do not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
