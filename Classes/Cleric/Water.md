When you choose this domain at 1st level you gain the shape water and ray of frost cantrips. For you, these cantrips count as cleric cantrips.

## Divine Dew
Also at first level, you can conjure blessed water to improve your vitality. As a bonus action, you can grant yourself or a creature you can see within 30 feet temporary hit points equal to twice your cleric level. These hit points last up to 1 hour.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Channel Divinity: Misty Shroud
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to cloak yourself and allies in a protective mist.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and a cold fog swirls around you for 1 round. Friendly creatures within 30 feet of you may immediately use a reaction to move up to half of their speed. Hostile creatures within 30 feet of you are unable to take reactions for the duration. The fog spreads around corners.

## Blessings of Water
Starting at 6th level, you can protect yourself and allies from fire and acid with a veil of water.

When a creature, including yourself, gains temporary hit points from a spell you cast, or a Cleric class feature you use, that creature also gains resistance to fire and acid damage while any of the temporary hit points remain.

## Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
