## Domain Spells
Starting at 1st level, you gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Unity Domain Spells table. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
