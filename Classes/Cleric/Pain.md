# Divine Domain: Pain
Pain. All creatures know pain, and all pay homage to it with their tears, and their whispered pleas that they be spared it. Pain is not just physical - in fact, the adherents of gods who grant this portfolio understand that physical pain is perhaps the least dangerous of its brothers and sisters. Priests who exercise this domain use it with precision to achieve their goals, bring the world a catharsis which it has long been denied. Gods of this domain include Loviatar, Iuz, Phieran and Lolth.

## Domain spells
You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Pain Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

Cleric Level | Pain Domain Spells
------------ | ------------------
1st | bane, hellish rebuke
3rd | cloud of daggers, heat metal
5th | bestow curse, fear
7th | phantasmal killer, staggering smite
9th | synaptic static, geas

## Sting
At 1st level, you can jab a creature with a distracting sting to foil their spellcasting. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you attempts to cast a spell, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make a concentration saving throw at disadvantage. On a failed saving throw, the spell fails and is wasted. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. Uses of this ability recharge at the end of a long rest.

## Channel Divinity: Excrutiation
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to bombard a creature with pain. As an action, you present your holy symbol and target a creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become wracked with devastasting pain, whether that be physical or emotional. While the target is affected, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted. This effect lasts for 1 minute.

## Agony Pulse
At 6th level, you can project your pain outwards from yourself in a pulse of invasive energy. As an action, you emit a wave of pain that travels outwards to 30 feet of you. Each creature in the area immediately awakens if asleep, and must make a concentration saving throw to maintain any spells they are concentrating on. Additonally, creatures under the influence of any mind-affecting magic may attempt another saving throw against that magic. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. Uses of this ability recharge at the end of a long rest.

## Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

## Hexing Vexation
Starting at 17th level, when a creature fails to cast a spell due to your Sting feature, the failed spell backlashes on the caster, dealing 1d6 psychic damage to them per level of the spell being cast.
