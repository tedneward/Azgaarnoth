# Divine Domain: Time
Ageless and wise, gods of time preside over the timeline of the multiverse. Clerics that worship these mighty embodiments of time are granted a small portion of their deity's power to manipulate time and space. These abilities help time domain clerics in carrying out their duties to ensure that time continues to progress along the correct path.

This domain is available to [Trinitarians who worship Sor](../../Religions/Trinitarian.md#sor), [Pelor](../../Religions/Pantheon/Pelor.md), ...

## Domain Spells
Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

## Chronoscopic Observer
*1st-level Time Domain feature*

You gain a bonus to initiative equal to your Wisdom modifier. You also become proficient in one of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, or Perception.

## Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity
*2nd-level Time Domain feature*

You can use your Channel Divinity to summon a visage of yourself from a parallel timeline.

As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.

For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

## Channel Divinity: Temporal Thrust
*6th-level Time Domain feature*

When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use Channel Divinity to attempt to thrust the struck creature into the near future. The struck creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or the creature disappears, having been sent 1d4 rounds into the future. After the 1d4 rounds pass, the target reappears at the end of your turn in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

## Divine Strike
*8th-level Time Domain feature*

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 force damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

## Master of Time
*17th-level Time Domain feature*

You may add the spells [time stop](../../Magic/Spells/time-stop.md) and [foresight](../../Magic/Spells/foresight.md) to your list of domain spells. Like your other domain spells, they are always prepared and count as cleric spells for you.
