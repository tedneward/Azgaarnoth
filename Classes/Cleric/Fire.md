# Divine Domain: Fire
The Dragonborn raises his hand forward to the bloody ghoul, a spark of flame flickering in it. "Return to cinders, feeble undead!" he shouts as a jet of fire spills onto the fiendish creature, with ashes already forming. His elven companion, behind him and dazed, comes to her senses as the Dragonborn raises an amulet and a swirl of flame billows beneath the two of them. Her body fills with renewed vigor, and they stand together, mending each others' wounds.

Clerics of Fire hold dominion over the powers of destruction and restoration. While fire is a symbol of chaos and unrelenting harm, it also acts as the symbol of purification, as incense is burned to permeate a scent of cleansing and healing.

## Domain Spells

## Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and marshal weapons.

## Wrath of the Inferno
At 1st level you can blazingly rebuke attackers. When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw using your spell save DC. The creature takes 2d8 fire damage on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once).

You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest, half the amount after a short rest.

## Channel Divinity: Searing Wrath
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to wield the power of the blaze with unchecked ferocity. When you roll fire or radiant damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage instead of rolling.

## Blazing Enhancement
At 6th level, once per long rest, you can imbue a weapon of your choice with flaming power, granting the weapon a damage bonus equal to half your Wisdom modifier (rounded down). This is a magical bonus (meaning it can damage those creatures with immunity to non-magical weapons), but does not aid the die roll to hit. This bonus lasts until your next long rest, after which you may use this feature again.

## Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to do an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

## Born of the Furnace
At 17th level, you have developed an immunity to all fire damage, including infernal fire and lava. When you cast a spell that deals fire or radiant damage, add your Wisdom modifier to that damage. You also gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from weapon attacks.
