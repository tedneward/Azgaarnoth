# Divine Domain: Entropy
All things must end. All creatures born into the planes of existence have some awareness of this fact from birth, and it comprises one of the most fundamental truths of reality. As such, some gods hold sway over the notion of entropy as a domain, though rare are those petitioners who would beg for their attention. Gods of this domain are often mad, capricious, or simply cruel, comprising such examples as Tharizdun, Toldoth and Nerull.

## Domain spells
You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Entropy Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

Cleric Level | Entropy Domain Spells
------------ | ---------------------
1st | inflict wounds, thunderwave
3rd | shatter, darkness
5th | life transference, vampiric touch
7th | blight, sickening radiance
9th | negative energy flood, antilife shell

## Rust Ward
At 1st level, your entropic magic wears away at the weapons of your assailants. When a creature hits you with a melee weapon attack, after dealing damage the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits you is destroyed after dealing damage.

## Channel Divinity: Dissolution
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to disintegrate physical objects. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and condemn an object within 5 feet of you that isn't being worn or carried. You can also target a 5 foot square section of a larger object, such as a wall. The chosen object disintegrates into a pile of dust.

## Entropic Gyre
At 6th level, your presence becomes anathema to all things of beauty and permanence. Magical objects are now affected by your Rust Ward and Channel Divinity features.

In addition, when you strike a creature with a melee attack, any armor or shield that creature is wearing takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed.

## Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with entropic energy. Once on each of the cleric's turns when he or she hits a creature with a weapon attack, the cleric can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. 

When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

## Radial Decomposition
Starting at 17th level, you can use your Dissolution feature to affect all objects within 10 feet of you that aren't being worn or carried.
