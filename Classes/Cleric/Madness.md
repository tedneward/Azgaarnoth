# Divine Domain: Madness
The Madness Domain celebrates the variety of shapes the mind can take, reveling in the truth and freedom of what others deride as insanity. The gods of madness seek to spread their gift and their perspective to all the mortal races and beyond, to disabuse fools of their fool ideas of "reality" and wake the sleeping masses from their idyllic dreams.

Most gods of madness are considered Evil and in some settings they are also fiends or undead, such as a demon lord of chaos and insanity or a lich god of deranged seekers who leave the world of mortal thought behind. Some are simply misunderstood divinities that seek to spread their unique and mind-bending perspective on reality, only called "mad" by the ignorant fools who know little of their revelations. These gods rarely speak of things like hope or peace, and often espouse a pessimistic or even paranoid view of creation.

## Bonus Cantrip
When you choose this domain at 1st level you learn the *vicious mockery* cantrip if you don't already know it.

## DIVINE HALLUCINATIONS
Starting at 1st level you can use an action to enter a catatonic trance to receive warnings from your god via hallucination. You become incapacitated for 1 minute as you experience a vivid hallucination that might be prophetic. The DM rolls a d6 in secret. On a roll of a 5 or 6, the DM shows you a likely future involving a real threat you're likely to face soon. On any other roll the DM shows you a paranoid vision of an unlikely future involving threats that are not real or that you're unlikely to face, such as a betrayal from allies that are actually trustworthy, or an attack from monsters that aren't actually present in the immediate area.

You can enter this trance a number of times equal to your cleric level divided by 4 (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## GIFT OF MADNESS
At 1st level you also learn how to ward off attackers by sharing your madness with them. Immediately after a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to assault it with hallucinations. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it takes psychic damage equal to 2 + half your cleric level and the hallucinations make it either blinded or deafened (your choice) and frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

You can use this reaction ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## CHANNEL DIVINITY: DREAD WHISPERS
At 2nd level you can use your Channel Divinity to infuse the creatures in an area with paranoid dread and maddening whispers warning them of betrayal. 

As an action, you choose a point that you can see within 60 feet. Each creature in a 10 foot sphere centered on that point must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes psychic damage equal to ld6 + half your cleric level and it becomes addled with dread for 1 minute. 

A creature addled with this dread treats all other creatures as enemies for the purpose of disadvantage for ranged attacks, and must make any opportunity attack it possibly can. At the end of an affected creature's turn, it repeats the saving throw. A success ends the effect on that creature.

## CRAZED STUMBLING
Starting at 6th level when you deal psychic damage to a creature you can cause it to stagger with fear and confusion. You can choose to push it up to 10 feet in any direction that it can move, but you cannot move it further than half its speed.

## POTENT SPELLCASTING
Starting at 8th level you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

## ALREADY MAD
Starting at 17th level you cannot be charmed or frightened and you have immunity to psychic damage.
