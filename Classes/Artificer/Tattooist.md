# Artificer Specialist: Tattooist
A Tattooist is an expert at inscribing mystical properties into ink on skin (or other cosmetic body modifications) to produce mystical effects. Rare outside of the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md), tattooists are nevertheless often prized for their ability to give individuals abilities that cannot be easily removed.

Tattoists can create their [tattoos](/Magic/Tattoos.md) in two ways: one is by artificing magical needles that can inscribe the tattoos upon the body at any time, or, alternatively, the tattooist can inscribe directly upon the body to create a more permanent effect.
