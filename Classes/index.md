# Classes
Azgaarnoth has a wide range of classes available, and a number of [feats](Feats.md) by which to customize them further:

## [Artificer](Artificer)
The artificer is a masters of invention, using ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions.

## [Barbarian](Barbarian)
A barbarian is defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.

## [Bard](Bard)
Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain.

## [Cleric](Cleric)
Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.

## [Druid](Druid)
The druid cals on the elemental forces of nature, sometimes emulating the creatures of the animal world, demonstrating an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature, but see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.

## [Fighter](Fighter)
Fighters share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. They are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

## [Monk](Monk)
Monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.

## [Mystic](Mystic)
Mystics shun the world to turn their eyes inward, mastering the full potential of their minds and exploring their psyches before turning to face the world. Mystics are incredibly rare, and most prefer to keep the nature of their abilities secret. Using their inner, psychic strength, they can read minds, fade into invisibility, transform their bodies into living iron, and seize control of the physical world and bend it to their will.

## [Paladin](Paladin)
Paladins stand as champions of their god, blessed with divine power and martial might, sworn to an oath that drives every aspect of their being.

## [Pale Master](PaleMaster)
The pale master is a magic user obsessed with the study of life and death and with harnessing this newfound knowledge to raise an unending cohort of the dead to do their bidding.

## [Ranger](Ranger)
Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.

## [Rogue](Rogue)
Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

## [Shaman](Shaman)
Shamans serve as intermediaries between the mortal world and the realms of spirits, called by the spirits to speak for them among mortals. These spirits come in a variety of forms, ranging from elemental nature spirits to the souls of fallen ancestors, and often take on animalistic shapes. While most shamans revere the spirits for which they speak, they rarely worship them outright. More often, a shaman negotiates with the spirits, being granted power both as a means to fulfill the spirits' needs and as a reward for doing so.

## [Sorcerer](Sorcerer)
The Sorcerer is born with arcane power flowing through their veins. Relying on instinct and intuition instead of careful study and analysis, they often have a better "feel" for magic than their Wizard cousins, at the expense of a deeper understanding of what they can cast.

## [Warlock](Warlock)
The Warlock forms a pact with a divine or near-divine figure to gain occult power, sometimes at hideous cost to themselves.

## [Wizard](Wizard)
The Wizard uses their ability to study and learn to master the casting of arcane magic.

---

In addition, players can have their characters [multiclass](Multiclassing.md) to gain greater flexibility at the expense of greater focus, and/or take on specialized levels known as *[prestige classes](Prestige)* to augment their abilities.
