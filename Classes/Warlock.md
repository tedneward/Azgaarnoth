Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

## Pact Magic
Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.

### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

### Spell Slots
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

### Spell Versatility
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Pact Magic feature with another spell from the warlock spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.

## Eldritch Invocations
*2nd-level warlock feature*

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

You gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

A level prerequisite in an invocation refers to warlock level, not character level.

### Agonizing Blast
*Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip*

When you cast [eldritch blast](), add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.

### Armor of Shadows
You can cast [mage armor]() on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

You can cast [levitate]() on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

### Aspect of the Moon
*Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature*

While someone else is wearing your talisman, you can use your action to teleport to the unoccupied space closest to them, provided the two of you are on the same plane of existence. The wearer of your talisman can do the same thing, using their action to teleport to you.

### Book of Ancient Secrets
*Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature*

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

### Chain Master’s Fury
*Prerequisite: 9th level, Pact of the Chain feature*

As a bonus action, you can command your familiar to make one attack.

### Chains of Carceri
*Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature*

You can cast [hold monster]() at will — targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental — without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.

### Cloak of Flies
*Prerequisite: 5th level*

As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a magical aura that looks like buzzing flies. The aura extends 5 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. It lasts until you’re incapacitated or you dismiss it as a bonus action.

The aura grants you advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks but disadvantage on all other Charisma checks. Any other creature that starts its turn in the aura takes poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0 damage).

Once you use this invocation, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Devil’s Sight
You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.

### Dreadful Word
*Prerequisite: 7th level*

You can cast [confusion]() once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Eldritch Armor

### Eyes of the Rune Keeper
You can read all writing.

### Far Scribe
*Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Tome feature*

A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

You can cast the sending spell, targeting a creature whose name is on the page, without using a spell slot and without using material components. To do so, you must write the message on the page. The target hears the message in their mind, and if the target replies, their message appears on the page, rather than in your mind. The writing disappears after 1 minute.

As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching the name on it.

### Fiendish Vigor
You can cast [false life]() on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components.

### Gaze of Two Minds
You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

### Ghostly Gaze
*Prerequisite: 7th level*

As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have darkvision if you don’t already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images.

Once you use this invocation, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Gift of the Depths
*Prerequisite: 5th level*

You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

You can also cast water breathing once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

### Gift of the Ever-Living Ones
*Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature*

Whenever you regain hit points while your familiar is within 100 feet of you, treat any dice rolled to determine the hit points you regain as having rolled their maximum value for you.

### Gift of the Protectors
*Prerequisite: 9th level, Pact of the Tome feature*

A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 hit point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a long rest.

As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching the name on it.

### Grasp of Hadar

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with your eldritch blast, you can move that creature in a straight line 10 feet closer to you.

### Improved Pact Weapon

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with your eldritch blast, you can reduce that creature’s speed by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.

### Maddening Hex

## Pact Boon
*3rd-level warlock feature*

Your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.

* **Pact of the Blade**
  You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

  Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

  You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.

  You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

* **Pact of the Chain**
  You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.

  When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.

  Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack of its own.

* **Pact of the Talisman**
  Your patron gives you a special amulet, a talisman that can aid you, or anyone else who wears it, when the need is great. When the wearer makes an ability check with a skill in which they lack proficiency, they can add a d4 to the roll. If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet.

  The talisman turns to ash when you die.

* **Pact of the Tome**
  Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They are considered warlock spells for you, and they needn't be from the same spell list. They don't count against your number of cantrips known.

  If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.


## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Mystic Arcanum
*11th-level warlock feature*

Your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

## Eldritch Master
*20th-level warlock feature*

You can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

# Warlock Spells
Warlock spells, despite being similar in some respects to arcane spells cast by wizards, are in fact a divergent form of divine magic; as a result, warlocks know only the spells listed here, and even then only at their paton's whim. Patrons have been known, however, to grant warlocks insight into the deep mysteries of the universe and reveal new magical means to emulate arcane or divine spells, however, and so warlocks often scour Azgaarnoth looking for fragments of insight or knowledge that will gain favor with their patron and persuade the patron to reveal new mystical insights.

> Game notes: In other words, DM's choice about adding new warlock spells to the "known" list, and the warlock may need to do some in-game activity or adventure to obtain them.
