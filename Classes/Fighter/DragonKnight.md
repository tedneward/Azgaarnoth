# Fighter Martial Archetype: Dragon Knight
Dragon Knights--almost all of them [Knights of the Draconic Order](../../Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md)--are known for their valor in battle and for their great personal charm during the victory feasts afterward. Their blades carry the sting of dragon's breath, and their resolve carries them ever onward into the eternal war between good and evil. But some few Dragon Knights are the agents of the [Cult of the Wyrm](../../Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md), and they inevitably wreak great havoc and fear on their immediate vicinity. Woe to those who draw the ire of a Dragon Knight.

Dragon Knights of the Draconic Order develop their class traits as part of rituals performed within the Order at each level progression; the trait may not be used until the ritual is performed. (Whether this ritual is arcane, divine, or simple communion with an actual metallic dragon is not clear, and the Order isn't saying.) Dragon Knights of the Cult of the Wyrm are usually bound to a particular dragon directly, and their traits manifest automatically. However, where Dragon Knights of the Draconic Order may operate openly, Dragon Knights of the Cult must keep their identity a secret if they do not wish to bring the full power of the Draconic Order in the area down upon their heads, at least in lands that are "civilized".

## Bonus Language
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to speak, read, and write Draconic. If you already know Draconic, you can learn a different language instead.

## Draconic Lord
When you choose this archetype, you develop a close tie to either the Draconic Order, or a cell of the Cult of the Wyrm, whom you serve as your lord. This bond grants you strengths and abilities, some of which are determined by your lord's type. Choose a dragon type from the Draconic Lord list, and work with your DM to develop a suitable backstory.

In rare cases, a particularly studious individual can learn enough about dragons and their powers and abilities to become a Dragon Knight without having a Draconic Lord. If you are such an anomaly, work with your DM to see how you were able to harness this power. Is it through bloodline? Perhaps an inexplicable magical bond?

## Draconic Strike
Starting at 3rd level, your draconic lord has granted you a measure of ability over his respective element. Once on each of your turns, when you hit with a weapon attack, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage of the type corresponding to your draconic lord's type. Consult the Draconic Lord list to learn which damage type you deal.

## Draconic Emissary
At 7th level, your Draconic Lord entrusts you to represent him in councils and other matters of great importance, and you carry a mote of your lord's charisma with you. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, if you don't already have it, and you can add double your proficiency bonus to any Charisma (Persuasion) skill checks you make.

The draconic influence has also strengthened your mind and wit. You gain proficiency in Charisma saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Wisdom or Intelligence saving throws (your choice).

## Draconic Resistance
At 10th level, the energy resistance of your lord begins to take hold on you. You gain resistance to a damage type according to the type of your draconic lord. Consult the Draconic Lord table to learn which damage type you become resistant to.

## Steel Will
When you reach 15th level, your loyalty lies unwavering with your draconic lord, and none can sway you. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened, charmed, or paralyzed, and against magical sleep.

## Draconic Eminence
At 18th level, you have harnessed an innate power of your draconic lord. Your ability at this level depends on your lord's type, as given in the Draconic Lord table. This ability can only be used once, and you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
