# Fighter Martial Archetype: Battle Master
Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.

Battle mastery is taught almost exclusively at the Great Academy run by the [Order of the Bronze Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Bronze.md), but many of its instructors and students have gone on to found much smaller schools or take on apprentices after leaving. Taking this archetype will typically involve spending some amount of time at the Academy or studying under one of its alumni in some fashion.

## Combat Superiority
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

***Maneuvers***. You learn three maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. These are listed in [Maneuvers](Maneuvers.md).

***Superiority Dice***. You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

### Maneuver Versatility
If you know any maneuvers from the above list, you can replace one maneuver you know with a different maneuver whenever you finish a long rest. This change reflects your physical and mental preparation for the day ahead.

## Student of War
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

## Know Your Enemy
Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:

* Strength score
* Dexterity score
* Constitution score
* Armor Class
* Current hit points
* Total class levels, if any
* Fighter class levels, if any

## Improved Combat Superiority
At 10th level, your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level, they turn into d12s.

## Relentless
Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.
