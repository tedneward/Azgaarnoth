# Martial Archetype: Blood Thrall
Within the deepest reaches of night, bound through blood to serve a vampire or demonic overlord, or even a mage or sorcerer well-versed in the power inherent in blood, you linger in a realm of madness from which few ever return. The strength of your dark master pulsates through your veins and whether from a forbidden ritual or enthralling kiss, it empowers your resolve.

Though free from loathsome servitude, the haunting voice of your master forever beckons you to return.

Blood thralls learn to draw strength from the dark gifts bestowed upon them by the perverse beings who once bound them to service. It requires a deep inner resolve to wield these dark boons without succumbing to savagery.

However, the common folk--and even many of the nobility--deeply distrust the Blood Thrall, both because of the influence once held (or worse, currently held) by that patron. Even if the Blood Thrall can convince others that the patron holds no influence, the sight of a Blood Thrall drawing nourishment and power from the blood of its enemies is enough to set even the stoutest heart in flight.

## Blood Drinker
*3rd-level Blood Thrall feature*

You can gain nourishment from the blood of your victims. When you hit a living creature with a melee weapon attack, your attack deals an extra 1d8 points of damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must also make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you gain temporary hit points equal to the roll of your extra damage + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

**Blood Drinker save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

You can use this feature twice between rests and only once a turn. Once you expended all uses of this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

At 10th level, the extra damage die becomes a d10. At 18th level, it becomes a d12.
