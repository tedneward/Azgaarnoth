# Martial Archetype: Dreadnought
Clad head to toe in plates of steel, the dreadnaught stands a veritable mountain of impenetrable defense. When the dreadnaught charges onto the battlefield, the earth trembles beneath their armored feet. Faced with the inability to harm such a foe, their enemies often break and run in fear. The dreadnaught cannot be stopped, cannot be resisted, and they shrug off all but the most powerful of blows.

Dreadnoughts are often the heavy infantry in Mercenary Companies and national standing armies.

## Mountain of Steel
At 3rd level, while wearing heavy armor you reduce the damage you suffer from slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage from nonmagical weapons by an amount equal to your Constitution bonus.

Additionally, you automatically begin with one success whenever you must start making death saves.

## Fear of Failure
At 7th level, if an attack fails to damage you, you may use your reaction to make a Strength (Intimidate) skill check against a DC of 8 + your opponent's proficiency bonus + opponent's Wisdom modifier. If you are successful, that opponent suffers disadvantage on all attacks made against you until the end of their next turn.

## Impenetrable Defense
At 10th level, you treat all critical hits as normal hits while wearing heavy armor.

## Improved Impenetrable Defense
At 15th level, magical weapons no longer bypass your damage resistances. In addition, you add your Constitution bonus to all death saves.

## Unyielding
At 18th level, when you suffer enough damage to be reduced to 0 hit points, you may spend a reaction to be reduced to 1 hit point instead.
