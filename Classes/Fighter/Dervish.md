# Martial Archetype: Dervish
The flash of steel, the blur of a swirling cloak, and the whisper of flesh being sliced open. These are your only warnings that you face a dervish. They strike faster than the eye can track. Each blow comes from an unexpected angle. Your retaliation comes too slow, cutting through empty space. When you face a dervish, you face a phantom--a phantom destined to kill you.

## Whirling Dervish
At 3rd level, your speed increases by a number of five foot squares equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down) while unarmored or wearing light armor.

In addition, add half your proficiency bonus to AC (rounded down) when you are not wearing medium or heavy armor and move at least 15 feet in a round. Any opportunity attacks you provoke by movement suffer disadvantage.

## Two-Weapon Mastery
At 7th level, you can wield two finesse weapons, even if those weapons are not light. In addition, you may add your Dexterity modifier to damage on the bonus attack.

## Improved Two-Weapon Mastery
At 10th level, your attacks become faster and deadlier. Add half your proficiency bonus to Initiative and to damage when dual-wielding finesse weapons while unarmored or wearing light armor. 

## Lightning Reflexes
At 15th level, you add a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus on Dexterity saves when not wearing medium or heavy armor.

## Storm of Fury
At 18th level, you can make an attack with a finesse weapon as a reaction whenever you deal a critical hit, provided you are not wearing medium or heavy armor.
