# Martial Archetype: Spearmaster
The spearmaster is a powerful front-line fighter who charges into the fray of combat without fear, decimating enemy ranks. They are a master of polearms and spears, trained from an early age to fight with polearms to devastating effect. They perform amazing leaps into the air, delivering devastating blows with their weapons as they land.

Some nations have trained elite forces comprised entirely of the terrifyingly effective spearmaster warriors. Other civilizations teach the spearmaster weapon form in secret, allowing only those who are truly worthy to master the leaping spear techniques.

## Spearmaster Leap
*3rd-level Spearmaster feature*

You gain advantage on all Strength (Athletics) checks made to jump when not wearing heavy armor. In addition, you are always considered to be making a running jump, even when you do not move prior to making a jump.

As a bonus action, you can make a high jump as part of an attack action, a maneuver known as the Spearmaster Leap. If your attack after this leap hits, you gain a +1d6 damage bonus, plus an additional +1d6 for every ten foot into the air you leap when striking with a polearm or spear.

As part of the Spearmaster Leap, if you strike an opponent, instead of inflicting the extra damage, you can attempt a shove attack to knock the target prone. If you choose the shove attack, you gain advantage on your Strength (Athletics) check.

## Polearm Mastery
*7th-level Spearmaster feature*

You gain either the Polearm Master, Spear Mastery or Great Weapon Master feat (choose one).

## Fall Mastery
*10th-level Spearmaster feature*

You ignore the first 10 feet of falling damage. You also gain resistance to falling damage when not wearing heavy armor. In addition, if you suffer no damage from a fall, you automatically land on your feet. The amount of falling distance you can ignore increases to 15 feet at 15th level, and 20 feet at 20th level.

## Terminal Velocity
*15th-level Spearmaster feature*

Whenever you make a Spearmaster Leap, your polearm or spear attacks deal critical hits on 19 and 20.

## Comet Strike
*18th-level Spearmaster feature*

When not wearing heavy armor you may declare a Spearmaster Leap an automatic critical hit. You can use this ability once, and can do so again after finishing a long rest.
