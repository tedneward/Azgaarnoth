# Fighter Martial Archetype: Rune Knight
Runes are thought to be the "original magic", the power by which the Eldar governed the world, and thus knowledge of how to scribe and use runes is highly prized. However, runes currently in use are a fraction of the power of the runes supposedly used by the Eldar, and to many within Azgaarnoth, runes have long since ceased to be a subject of interest; either the magic of runes has fallen completely, or the fall of the Eldar took too much knowledge, or the Eldar's use of runes has proven runes to be inadequate, the rationale all depends on the point of view of the speaker.

You discovered how to enhance your martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes. You likely learned your methods first or second hand from one of the few who know how to scribe such runes, or found an ancient rune carved into a hill or cave. In time, you learned how to carve and apply runes to your equipment and how to invoke their magic, ultimately becoming a Rune Knight.

> Rune Knights either have in the past or will in the future run into or work with the [School of the Eldar](/Organizations/MageSchools/SchoolOfTheEldar.md) at some point in their career. In fact, it's highly likely that even if the Rune Knight hasn't directly met up with a member of that school, the school has had the Rune Knight under observation and simply chosen not to approach.

For whatever reason, Rune Knight runes run very closely to the races of giants found with Azgaarnoth; whether this indicates a tie between the giants and the [Eldar](/Races/Eldar.md) is subject to great speculation among the few rune scholars alive.

## Bonus Proficiencies
*3rd-level Rune Knight feature*

You gain proficiency with smith's tools, and you learn to speak, read, and write Giant.

## Rune Carver
*3rd-level Rune Knight feature*

You can use magic runes to enhance your gear. You learn two runes of your choice, from among the [list of runes](/Magic/Runes.md), and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one rune you know with a different one from this feature. When you reach certain levels in this class, you learn additional runes, as shown in the Runes Known table.

**Runes Known**
Fighter Level|Number of Runes
-------------|---------------
3rd | 2
7th | 3
10th| 4
15th| 5

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of runes you know, and you inscribe a different rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a weapon, a suit of armor, a shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your rune remains on an object until you finish a long rest, and an object can bear only one of your runes at a time.

If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

## Giant's Might
*3rd-level Rune Knight feature*

You have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a bonus action, you magically gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute:
* If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn't change.
* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* Once on each of your turns, one of your attacks with a weapon or an unarmed strike can deal an extra ld6 damage to a target on a hit.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

## Runic Shield
*7th-level Rune Knight feature*

You learn to invoke your rune magic to protect your allies. When another creature you can see within 60 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the d20 and use the new roll. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Great Stature
*10th-level Rune Knight feature*

The magic of your runes permanently alters you. When you gain this feature, roll 3d4. You grow a number of inches in height equal to the roll. Morepver, the extra damage you deal with your Giant's Might feature increases to ld8.

## Master of Runes
*15th-level Rune Knight feature*

You can invoke each rune you know from your Rune Carver feature twice, rather than once, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

## Runic Juggernaut
*18th-level Rune Knight feature*

You learn how to amplify your rune-powered transformation. As a result, the extra damage you deal with the Giant's Might feature increases to 1d10. Moreover, when you use that feature, your size can increase to Huge, and while you are that size, your reach increases by 5 feet.
