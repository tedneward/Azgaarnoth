<h1 id="martial-archetype-ghost-warrior">Martial Archetype: Ghost Warrior</h1>
<p>The Ghost Warrior draws upon the collective wisdom, knowledge, and experience of a choir of ghosts or other ancestral spirits. This choir remains bonded to them, invisible and silent until summoned, offering guidance until the warrior fulfills their destiny or perishes in battle. Such a choir includes ancestral spirits, as well as spirits of former protectors of their clan and legendary warriors slain in combat--and perhaps even an enemy or rival slain by their hand. When the Ghost Warrior needs insight or advice, they listen to these spirits and--if wise--heed their counsel. In those moments where the ghost warrior needs an edge against enemies, they allow one of the spirits to possess their body. When the time comes and the ghost warrior falls, then they become part of another warrior's choir, continuing the cycle of life and death.</p>
<p>The Ghost Warrior is most commonly found among the tribes of Yithi, Zhi, and (increasingly) among the United Hordes.</p>

<h2 id="ghostly-choir">Ghostly Choir</h2>
<p><em>3rd-level Ghost Warrior feature</em></p>
<p>You have a collection of spirits known as a choir. These spirits, bound to you until your death, follow and watch over you. In times of danger or stress, you call upon one of these spirits to aid you. Each spirit offers a different benefit, but each demands a sacrifice in exchange for their help.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ghosts.</em></strong> You gain the services of four ghosts of your choice, which are described below under "Spirits." Each spirit provides a different benefit; some aid your attacks or defenses, while others help you with ability checks or saving throws. You can only benefit from one spirit per attack or action.</p>
<p>Under normal conditions (except as noted below), only you can see your choir or hear their voices. These spirits can, however, be detected by means of detect magic, and can be seen with a  gem of true seeing. The ghosts are not treated as undead or any type of creature--they cannot be attacked, harmed, exorcised, or banished.</p>
<p>Once you've gained a particular spirit's benefit, you cannot call upon that same spirit again until after you've completed a short or long rest.</p>
<pre><code>def level3(npc):
    npc.defer(lambda npc: npc.traits.append(f&quot;***Ghostly Choir.*** You gain the services of several ghostly spirits. You can only benefit from one spirit per attack or action. Under normal conditions (except as noted), only you can see your choir or hear their voices. These spirits can, however, be detected by means of {spelllinkify('detect magic')}, and can be seen with a *gem of true seeing*. The ghosts are not treated as undead or any type of creature--they cannot be attacked, harmed, exorcised, or banished. Once you've gained a particular spirit's benefit, you cannot call upon that same spirit again until after you've completed a short or long rest. Currently you have a choir consisting of the spirits of &quot; + &quot;,&quot;.join(npc.ghosts)))

</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Saving Throw.</em></strong> Some benefits provided by your ghostly choir call for your target to make a saving throw to avoid or resist the feature's effects. Calculate the saving throw DC as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Spirit save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
<h2 id="the-spirit-path">The Spirit Path</h2>
<p><em>3rd-level Ghost Warrior feature</em></p>
<p>As long as you have at least one spirit you have not invoked, you gain proficiency in two skills chosen from History, Medicine, Religion, and Survival. If you have called upon all your spirits, you lose this feature until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
<pre><code>    skill1 = chooseskill(npc, ['History','Medicine','Religion','Survival'])

</code></pre>
<h2 id="ghostly-counsel">Ghostly Counsel</h2>
<p><em>7th-level Ghost Warrior feature</em></p>
<p>As a free action you can call upon any one of your spirits to double your proficiency bonus in one skill of your choice, in place of the usual bonus that spirit provides.</p>
<pre><code>def level7(npc):
    npc.traits.append(&quot;***Ghostly Counsel.*** As a free action you can call upon any one of your spirits to double your proficiency bonus in one skill of your choice, in place of the usual bonus that spirit provides.&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="greater-spirit-choir">Greater Spirit Choir</h2>
<p><em>10th-level Ghost Warrior feature</em></p>
<p>Add three additional spirits to your choir. At 18th level, you gain an additional three spirits.</p>
<pre><code>def level10(npc):

<h2 id="resurgence">Resurgence</h2>
<p><em>15th-level Ghost Warrior feature</em></p>

<pre><code>def level15(npc):

</code></pre>
<h1 id="spirits">Spirits</h1>
<p>When you add a spirit to your choir, select from those described below. Once you select a spirit, you cannot change it. </p>
<p>When you gain a new fighter level, you can change one of your spirits for another.</p>
<p><strong><em>Berserker.</em></strong> His rage clouds your mind, blocking your foe's honeyed words. You do not summon this spirit, but rather he appears unbidden. If you fail a saving throw against an effect that imposes the charmed condition, each round thereafter at the beginning of your turn you may reroll the saving throw with advantage. If you succeed, the charm effect ends. If you fail, however, you suffer 1 hit point per level of damage. This feature continues until you break free of the charm or drop to 0 hit points--you cannot voluntarily end this feature.</p>
<pre><code>def berserker(npc):

This feature continues until you break free of the charm or drop to 0 hit points--you cannot voluntarily end this feature.&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Butcher.</em></strong> She bleeds your enemies of their vitality, granting it to you. You can invoke this spirit as a bonus action. Choose a number of enemies equal to your proficiency bonus that you can see within 30 feet. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer 2 points of necrotic damage. You regain half of this amount as temporary hit points.</p>
<pre><code>def butcher(npc):

You regain half of this amount as temporary hit points.&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Coward.</em></strong> He teaches you the value of fear and caution. If you take the disengage action to move away from an enemy, your speed increases by half for that round only. Unlike the other spirits, you do not lose the coward feature after using him. Instead, choose one of your other ghostly choir. You instead lose that spirit's feature until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
<pre><code>def coward(npc):

You instead lose that spirit's feature until you complete a short or long rest.&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Crone.</em></strong> She peers a few moments ahead into your future and predicts what might happen. When an effect requires you to make a saving throw, as a reaction you can draw on this spirit and have advantage on that saving throw. If you cannot take a reaction, you cannot call upon the crone.</p>
<pre><code>def crone(npc):

</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Fallen Hero.</em></strong> He bolsters your reserves and helps you overcome hopeless odds. When an attack would drop you to 0 hit points, as a reaction you can summon this spirit. You remain at 1 hit point, standing and conscious. If you take further damage that drops you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.</p>
<pre><code>def fallenhero(npc):

If you take further damage that drops you to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious.&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Healer.</em></strong> Her gentle touch alleviates pain and staunches wounds. When you invoke the healer as an action, you may expend a number of your available recovery hit dice equal to 1 plus 1 additional die per five levels, as part of that action. Alternatively, you can ask the spirit to infuse one of your allies within 30 feet that you can see with the benefits of one of your recovery dice.</p>
<pre><code>def healer(npc):

</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Hunter.</em></strong> This spirit guides your step, allowing you to move stealthily. Invoke this spirit as a bonus action to gain advantage on your next Dexterity (Stealth) check.</p>
<pre><code>def hunter(npc):
    npc.defer(lambda npc: npc.bonusactions.append(f&quot;***Spirit: Hunter.*** Gain advantage on your next Dexterity (Stealth) check.&quot;))
</code></pre>
