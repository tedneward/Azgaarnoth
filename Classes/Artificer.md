# Artificer
Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.

Artificers are almost always recruited at some point by [Merchant Guilds](/Organizations/MerchantGuilds/MerchantGuilds.md), [Mercenary Companies](/Organizations/MercCompanies/MercCompanies.md), or the [Order of the Steel Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Steel.md), in that order, depending on the level/quality of the work produced by the artificer. (The Steels want only the best as part of their Order, and the merchants want anything they can sell regardless of quality.)

Rumors persist that the [Dread Emperor](/People/DreadEmperor.md) has been known to kidnap promising artificers, and force them to artifice on his behalf.

## Magical Tinkering
*1st-level artificer feature*

You've learned how to invest a spark of magic in objects that would otherwise be mundane. To use this ability, you must have thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools, or other artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:
* The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
* Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
* The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
* A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can give the magic of this feature to multiple objects, touching one object each time you use the feature, and a single object can bear only one of the properties at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with the feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

## Spellcasting
*1st-level artificer feature*

You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.· 

### Tools Required
You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus— specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an "M" component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chapter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.

After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.  

### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list (at the end of this page). At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

## Preparing and Casting Spells
The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent in tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Ritual Casting
You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

## Infuse Item
*2nd-level artificer feature*

You've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magical items.

### Infusions Known
When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “Artificer Infusions” section at the end of the class’s description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

### Infusing an Item
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item, or you can forgo attunement so that someone else an attune to the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see “Attunement” in the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*).

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. No object can bear more than one of your infustions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a *bag of holding*, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space. 

## Artificer Specialist
*3rd-level artificer feature*

Choose the type of specialist you are: [Alchemist](Artificer/Alchemist.md), [Armorer](Artificer/Armorer.md), [Artillerist](Artificer/Artillerist.md), or [Battle Smith](Artificer/BattleSmith.md).

## The Right Tool for the Job
*3rd-level artificer feature*

You've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

## Ability Score Improvement
*4th-level artificer feature*

When you reach 4th level and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

## Tool Expertise
*6th-level artificer feature*

Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool. 

## Flash of Genius
*7th-level artificer feature*

You've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Magic Item Adept
*10th-level artificer feature*

You've achieved a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:

* You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
* If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.

## Spell-Storing Item
*11th-level artificer feature*

You can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared). 

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

## Magic Item Savant
*14th-level artificer feature*

Your skill with magic items deepens:

* You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
* You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.

## Magic Item Master
*18th-level artificer feature*

You can now attune to up to six magic items at once.

## Soul of Artifice
*20th-level artificer feature*

You have developed a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

* You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0. 


## Artificer Infusions
Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item. The description of each of the following infusions details the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.

Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level. You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.

Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.

#### Arcane Propulsion Armor
*Prerequisite: 14th-level artificer*

*Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)*

The wearer of this armor gains these benefits:

* The wearer's walking speed increases by 5 feet.
* The armor includes gauntlets, each of which is a magic melee weapon that can be wielded only when the hand is holding nothing. The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals ld8 force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet detaches and flies at the attack's target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches.
* The armor can't be removed against the wearer's will.
* If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbs-hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages. The replacements function identically to the body parts they replace. 

#### Armor of Magical Strength
*Item: A suit of armor (requires attunement)*

This armor has 6 charges. The wearer can expend the armor's charges in the following ways:
* When the wearer makes a Strength check or a Strength saving throw, it can expend 1 charge to add a bonus to the roll equal to its Intelligence modifier.
* If the creature would be knocked prone, it can use its reaction to expend 1 charge to avoid being knocked prone.

The armor regains ld6 expended charges daily at dawn. 

#### Boots of the Winding Path
*Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer*

*Item: A pair of boots (requires attunement)*

While wearing these boots, a creature can teleport up to 15 feet as a bonus action to an unoccupied space the creature can see. The creature must have occupied that space at some point during the current turn.

#### Enhanced Arcane Focus
*Item: A rod, staff, or wand (requires attunement)*

While holding this item, a creature gains a + 1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, the creature ignores half cover when making a spell attack.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.

#### Enhanced Defense
*Item: A suit of armor or a shield*

A creature gains a+ 1 bonus to Armor Class while wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) the infused item.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.

#### Enhanced Weapon
*Item: A simple or martial weapon*

This magic weapon grants a +l bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.

#### Helm of Awareness
*Prerequisite: 10th-level artificer*

*Item: A helmet (requires attunement)*

While wearing this helmet, a creature has advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, the wearer can't be surprised, provided it isn't incapacitated.

#### Homunculus Servant
*Item: A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp*

You learn intricate methods for magically creating a special homunculus that serves you. The item you infuse serves as the creature's heart, around which the creature's body instantly forms.

You determine the homunculus's appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.

The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the [Homunculus Servant](/Creatures/HomunculusServant.md) stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space. 

#### Mind Sharpener
*Item: A suit of armor or robes*

The infused item can send a jolt to the wearer to refocus their mind. The item has 4 charges. When the wearer fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, the wearer can use its reaction to expend 1 of the item's charges to succeed instead. The item regains ld4 expended charges
daily at dawn.

#### Radiant Weapon
*Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer*

*Item: A simple or martial weapon (requires attunement)*

This magic weapon grants a + 1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, the wielder can take a bonus action to cause it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The wielder can extinguish the light as a bonus action.

The weapon has 4 charges. As a reaction immediately after being hit by an attack, the wielder can expend 1 charge and cause the attacker to be blinded until the end of the attacker's next turn, unless the attacker succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The weapon regains ld4 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Repeating Shot
*Item: A simple or martial weapon with the ammunition property (requires attunement)*

This magic weapon grants a + 1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it when it's used to make a ranged attack, and it ignores the loading property if it has it.

If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when you make a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

#### Replicate Magic Item
Using this infusion, you replicate a particular magic item. You can learn this infusion multiple times; each time you do so, choose a magic item that you can make with it, picking from the Replicable Items tables. A table's title tells you the level you must be in the class to choose an item from the table. Alternatively, you can choose the magic item from among the common magic items in the game, not including potions or scrolls.

In the tables, an item's entry tells you whether the item requires attunement. See the item's description in the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information about it, including the type of object required for its making.
