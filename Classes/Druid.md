# Class: Druid
Druids follow the path of [Druidism](/Religions/Druidism.md) and carve their own path. Frequently that path comes into conflict with one or more of the established religions or nations or other organizations, but the druids press on, knowing that they labor on behalf of the entire world. The gods and the Eldar might await in the afterlife, but druids worry about this one.
