# Sorcerer
Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

*You must have a Charisma score of 13 or higher in order to multiclass in or out of this class.*

As a sorcerer, you gain the following class features.

## Hit Points
**Hit Dice**: 1d6 per sorcerer level

**Hit Points at 1st Level**: 6 + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels**: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per sorcerer level after 1st

## Proficiencies
**Armor**: None

**Weapons**: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows

**Tools**: None

**Saving Throws**: Constitution, Charisma

**Skills**: Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, and Religion

## Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
* (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
* (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
* Two daggers

## Spellcasting
An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.

### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.

### Spell Slots
The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Burning Hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Burning Hands using either slot.

### Spell Versatility
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.

## Sorcerous Origin
Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power:
* [Aberrant Mind](Sorcerer/AberrantMind.md) sorcerers have been touched by creatures of the astral deep
* [Clockwork Soul](Sorcerer/ClockworkSoul.md) means the powers of neutrality call to you.
* [Divine Soul](Sorcerer/DivineSoul.md) sorcerers have found favor with celestial beings.
* [Draconic Bloodline](Sorcerer/DraconicBloodline.md) suggests that the dragons, somewhere, somewhen, fit into your family tree; alternatively, you might have had a [dragonmarked](/Races/Dragonmarked.md) somewhere in your family line.
* [Firespeaker](Sorcerer/Firespeaker.md), [Seacaller](Sorcerer/Seacaller.md), [Stoneshaper](Sorcerer/Stoneshaper.md), and [Windtalker](Sorcerer/Windtalker) sorcerers hear the calls within the elements from the Elemental Planes themselves; they hear the elements, all around them.
* [Giant Soul](Sorcerer/GiantSoul.md) sorcerers have ancient giantish blood within them.
* [Green Star](Sorcerer/GreenStar.md) sorcerers feel the power of an ancient stone of power in their blood somehow.
* [Phoenix](Sorcerer/Phoenix.md) sorcerers have the power of the ancient phoenix within them.
* [Psionic Soul](Sorcerer/PsionicSoul.md) sorcerers have touched the power of the mind. 
* [Shadow](Sorcerer/Shadow.md) sorcerers have been touched by the Shadowfell.
* [Storm](Sorcerer/Storm.md) sorcerers feel the power of the storm, and are extremely common (and valued) among the *al'maera* of the [Al'Uma](/Cultures/AlUma.md).
* [Wild Magic](Sorcerer/WildMagic.md) sorcerers wrestle with power beyond control.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Font of Magic
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

### Sorcery Points
You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

### Flexible Casting
You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.

***Creating Spell Slots***. You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th. The created spell slots vanish at the end of a long rest.

**Creating Spell Slots**
Spell Slot Level|Sorcery Point Cost
----------------|------------------
1st|2
2nd|3
3rd|5
4th|6
5th|7

***Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points***. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.

***Empowering Reserves***. When you make an ability check on your turn, you can spend 2 sorcery points to gain advantage on the check.

***Imbuing Touch***. As an action, you can touch one nonmagical weapon and spend 2 sorcery points to imbue it with magic for 1 minute. For the duration, the weapon is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.

***Sorcerous Fortitude***. As an action, you can spend any number of sorcery points to roll a d4 for each point expended. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the total rolled.

## Metamagic
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

* **Careful Spell**
  When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

* **Distant Spell**
  When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.

  When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

* **Elemental Spell** 
  When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder.

* **Empowered Spell**
  When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

  You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

* **Extended Spell**
  When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

* **Heightened Spell**
  When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

* **Quickened Spell**
  When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

* **Seeking Spell**
  When you cast a spell that requires you to make a spell attack roll or that forces a target to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can spend 1 sorcery point to ignore the effects of half- and three-quarters cover against targets of the spell.

* **Subtle Spell**
  When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

* **Twinned Spell**
  When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). To be eligible for Twinned Spell, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level.

* **Unerring Spell**
  If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 sorcery points to reroll the attack roll. You must use the result of the second roll.
  
  You can use Unerring Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

## Sorcerous Restoration
At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.

# Sorcerer Spells
This is a list of all the sorcerer spells known to any sorcerer in Azgaarnoth. However, sorcerer spells beyond these are known to exist, but a sorcerer must have access to a source (another sorcerer, or optionally, a scroll or book written by a sorcerer) who knows the new spell the sorcerer wishes to learn. Note this is not a spellbook--a sorcerer, once they know a spell, does not need to return to the book to re-learn it. Understanding how to shape the power correctly, however, can sometimes require guidance and inspiration.

> ### Game Notes
> The sorcerer spells found in Azgaarnoth that are not on this list are thus under the DM's discretion regarding their release into player hands. Some DMs will want to keep them out of player hands, simply to keep the players guessing and trying to prepare for the unknown when those spells are used against them.

Some of the [mage schools](/Organizations/MageSchools/MageSchools.md) know sorcerer spells that are not on this list, and those schools can (and frequently do) share those secrets with other sorcerers... for a price.

> ### Game Notes
> It is important to note that having access to a wizard's spell book does not serve as a sufficient source for a sorcerer to learn a spell; one is casting spells by strict recipe, the other by a far more intuitive process. A sorcerer might have some advantage in trying to recreate a wizard spell as a sorcerer spell if they have access to a wizard's spellbook describing the spell, but that is entirely up to the DM.
