# Arcane Tradition: Mentalism
Wizards who practiced in the way of the mentalist tradition, have spent their life studying the workings of the mind, and the magic that affects it. The mentalist's puissance allows them to shake the confidence of their foes as well as attack their psyche directly, in a potent combination that only the most resilient minds can withstand.

This tradition emerged out of the study of the [Mind Mage](../../Organizations/MageSchools/MindMage.md) school, and is restricted to those who are associated (past or present) with that school. (Most mentalists are members of Mind Mage, but several mentalists have "defected" to the Council of Seers in [Zhi](../../Nations/Zhi.md), and can sometimes be persuaded to pass on their skills to select others from that nation.)

## Whisper Magic
At 2nd level, any spell that deals psychic damage is added to your spell list, and the gold and time you must spend to copy a spell that deals psychic damage into your spellbook is halved. Additionally, you know the [vicious mockery]() cantrip.

## Tendrils of Doubt
Starting at 2nd level, you've learned how to plant seeds of doubt into the minds of your enemies. When you deal psychic damage to a creature, they have disadvantage on attack rolls against you and one other creature of your choice that you can see, until the start of your next turn.

## Bond of the Mentalist
Beginning at 6th level, you can communicate telepathically with any creature within 30 feet. The creature must be able to understand a language you can speak. The range of this ability increases by 30 feet at 11th level (total of 60 feet), and again at 17th level (total
of 90 feet).

## Demoralising Onslaught
At 10th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can choose to change the damage type to psychic. You cannot use this ability again until you finish a long rest.

## Guileful Retort
Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from an enemy's attack, you can use your reaction to cast [vicious mockery]() against that creature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once) and you regain all expended uses after completing a long rest.
