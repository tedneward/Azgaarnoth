# Arcane Tradition: Incantation
Incanters (or Incantifer or Incantrix) – also called
metamages – manipulate the raw magical potential in
themselves and others, augmenting or suppressing the
magical energy they are able to draw upon. Incanters
can be a boon for allies, and a nightmare for enemy
spellcasters.

Spell Savant
Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana
skill if you don’t already have it, and you can identify
spells that you can see being cast, as a free action. To
identify a spell you must make a successful Intelligence
(Arcana) check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level.
Augment Magic
At 2nd level, you can augment a spell that you cast, as a
bonus action. The augmented spell is treated as if being
cast at one level higher than the spell slot level used to
cast the spell ie if you cast a spell using a 3rd level spell
slot, the spell is cast at 4th level. You can use this ability
a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum of once) regaining all expended uses after
finishing a long rest.
Weavemaster
Beginning at 6th level, you have become adept at
dismantling other spells. When you cast counterspell
or dispel magic, it is treated as if being cast at one level
higher than the spell slot level used to cast the spell.
You regain the use of this ability after finishing a short
or long rest.
Body to Mind
Starting at 10th level, when you take a short rest, you
can use your Hit Dice to regain expended spell slots.
Each Hit Die expended in this manner allows you to
regain one expended spell slot. Expending 3 Hit Dice
allows the recovery of three spell slot levels; be it one
3rd level spell slot, one 2nd level spell slot and a 1st
level spell slot, or three 1st level spell slots. You regain
the use of this ability after completing a long rest.
Magic Resistance
Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.
