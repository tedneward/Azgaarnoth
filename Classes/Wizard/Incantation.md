# Arcane Tradition: Incantation
Incanters (or Incantifer or Incantrix) – also called metamages – manipulate the raw magical potential in themselves and others, augmenting or suppressing the magical energy they are able to draw upon. Incanters can be a boon for allies, and a nightmare for enemy spellcasters.

Incanters are frequently found in any of the [Mage Schools](../../Organizations/MageSchools/index.md), often as "support staff" to augment or safeguard the research being done by the rest of the school.

## Spell Savant
Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don’t already have it, and you can identify spells that you can see being cast, as a free action. To identify a spell you must make a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level.

## Augment Magic
At 2nd level, you can augment a spell that you cast, as a bonus action. The augmented spell is treated as if being cast at one level higher than the spell slot level used to cast the spell ie if you cast a spell using a 3rd level spell slot, the spell is cast at 4th level. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once) regaining all expended uses after finishing a long rest.

## Weavemaster
Beginning at 6th level, you have become adept at dismantling other spells. When you cast counterspell or dispel magic, it is treated as if being cast at one level higher than the spell slot level used to cast the spell. 

You regain the use of this ability after finishing a short or long rest.

## Body to Mind
Starting at 10th level, when you take a short rest, you can use your Hit Dice to regain expended spell slots.

Each Hit Die expended in this manner allows you to regain one expended spell slot. Expending 3 Hit Dice allows the recovery of three spell slot levels; be it one 3rd level spell slot, one 2nd level spell slot and a 1st level spell slot, or three 1st level spell slots. 

You regain the use of this ability after completing a long rest.

## Magic Resistance
Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
