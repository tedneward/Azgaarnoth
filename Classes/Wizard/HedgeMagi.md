# Arcane Tradition: Hedge Magic
Wizards who wander the realms devoting their time to
discovering better ways to use magic to aid their allies
and defeat their foes, hedge mages are a complementary
addition to any adventuring party. These wizards often
join forces with others to defeat common enemies,
choosing a favored enemy during their adventures to
hedge their magic power against, both offensive and
defensive. They do not join a formal school of magic but
refi ne their skills with magic during their adventures.

Hedge magi, by definition, do not belong to any school.

Favored Enemy
Beginning at 2nd level, when you choose this arcane
tradition, you have gained enough knowledge about
certain creatures to gain a heightened chance to affect
them with your spells. Choose a type of favored enemy:
aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons,
elementals, fey, fi ends, giants, monstrosities, oozes,
plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can choose two
races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored
enemies.
You have advantage on your Constitution saving
throws to maintain your concentration while a favored
enemy that you can see is conscious and within 60 feet
of you. In addition, your spell save DC for your wizard
spells increases by 1 against your favored enemies.
When you gain this feature, you learn one language
spoken by one of your favored enemies.
You can choose one additional favored enemy at 6th
and 14th level.
Hedge Spellcasting
Starting at 2nd level, you can expend your spellcasting
energy to protect against harmful spells that target you
or a nearby ally. Alternatively, you can expend extra
spellcasting energy to improve your chances of affecting
an enemy with a harmful spell you cast.
Hedge Defense – when you or an ally that you can
see within 30 feet of you must make a saving throw
against a harmful spell, you can use your reaction to
expend a spell slot equal to half the harmful spell’s level
to grant you or the ally advantage on the saving throw.
Hedge Offense – When you cast a harmful spell that
requires a saving throw against one or more of your
enemies, you can expend an additional spell slot equal
to the original spell’s level to boost the spell’s power
and impose disadvantage on the saving throw for a
number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifi er
minimum 1).
Improved Arcane Recovery
At 6th level, you have learned to recover extra spell
energy when you use Arcane Recovery to recover
expended spell slots. You recover additional spell slots
equal to your Intelligence modifi er (minimum of 1) at
the end of a short rest using Arcane Recovery.
Intuitive Synergy
At 10th level, your sense of caution and experience,
combined with your quick wit and ability to
communicate effectively with adventuring companions,
grants you and your team a heightened ability to
function well together. When initiative is rolled, you
and allies within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you,
and have traveled with you for at least one week, can
add your Intelligence modifi er to the roll (minimum of
1).
Hedge Reliability
At 14th level, your ability to hedge against spell
effects targeting you and your allies, or to boost the
effectiveness of your spells against your enemies, is
more dependable. When initiative is rolled, you can
recover spell slots equal to your Intelligence modifi er
(minimum of 1), however, you can only use the spell
slots for your Hedge Spellcasting feature. At the end of
the encounter, you lose any remaining spell slots gained
from this feature.
