# Arcane Tradition: School of Bladesinging
The original bladesingers were elves who bravely stood against the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md). They were elf wizards who mastered a school of sword fighting grounded in a tradition of arcane magic. In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense.

Styles of Bladesinging are broadly categorized based on the type of weapon employed, and each is associated with a category of animal. Within that style are specializations named after specific animal types, based on the types of spells employed, the techniques of the master, and the particular weapon used.

Styles that employ a sword belong to the Cat family, including the longsword-wielding Lion style, and the scimitar-wielding Red Tiger style. Styles that focus on the use of hafted weapons belong to the Bird family, including the handaxe-throwing Eagle style or warpick-wielding Raven style. Styles that use whips, chains, or flails are included in the Snake style family, such as the whip-wielding Viper style.

Bladesingers who apprentice to a master typically get a tattoo of their chosen style's animal. Some bladesingers learn multiple styles and bear many tattoos, wearing a warning on their skin of their deadly skills. Bladesingers are rare, but a few have taken students while taking residence at a [dueling college](/Organizations/DuelingColleges.md). Every Bladesinger, however, feels a deep-seated need to pass on their skills and knowledge to a new generation, and many take multiple students before passing on. Some Bladesingers have also taken up residence with [kensai](/Classes/Monk/Kensai.md) monasteries, and a few teach at the Academy of the [Bronze Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Bronze.md).

## Training in War and Song
When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor, and you gain proficiency with one type of one-handed melee weapon of your choice.

You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already have it.

## Bladesong
Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke a secret elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time you choose (no action required).

While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

* Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

* You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.

* You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

## Extra Attack
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Song of Defense
Beginning at 10th level, you can direct your magic to absorb damage while your Bladesong is active. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend one spell slot and reduce that damage to you by an amount equal to five times the spell slot's level.

## Song of Victory
Starting at 14th level, you add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage of your melee weapon attacks while your Bladesong is active.
