# Arcane Tradition: Geomancy
Geomancy wizards are the kind of wizard who appreciate the sturdiness and stability of earth magic. The world of stone, dirt, and rock is fi rm, hardy and strong. A wizard who learns to harness the magic of the earth can become a hardy practitioner of magic; one who can withstand even the toughest of foes.

## Geomancer's Knowledge
Starting at 2nd level, your affi nity for utilizing stone and the earth has become second nature for you. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in rocky terrain, and advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain your concentration while in rocky terrain.

Additionally, the following spells are added to the wizard spell list for you: bones of the earth, earthquake, magic stone, and meld into stone.

## Stone Form
At 6th level, as an action, you can transform yourself temporarily into stone form, your skin hardening and taking on a number of characteristics of an earth elemental. You can use this feature twice and you regain expended uses after finishing a long rest.

Whilst in stone form, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, you are immune to the poisoned condition and have immunity to poison damage, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons. Additionally, your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet and you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

You maintain your stone form for 1 hour unless you end it early using a bonus action. If you fall unconscious, drop to zero hit points, or die, you automatically revert to your normal form.

## Protection of the Earth
Beginning at 10th level, if you revert back to your normal form from your stone form as a result of the duration time of 1 hour has expired, or by using your bonus action to do so, you gain temporary hit points equal to your wizard level + your Constitution modifier.

## Master Geomancer
At 14th level, you can use your stone form ability an additional number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You can expend 2 uses of your stone form ability to instead transform into the form of an earth elemental (MM p.124). Whilst in earth elemental form, you can speak any languages you know.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the earth elemental, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw profi ciencies, in addition to gaining those of the earth elemental. If the earth elemental has the same profi ciency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the earth elemental’s bonus instead of yours.
* You can’t cast spells while transformed. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as rain of stones (see below), that you’ve already cast.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the earth elemental form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any special senses that you might have (such as darkvision) unless the earth elemental also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your earth elemental form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the earth elemental to wear a piece of equipment based on the earth elemental’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the earth elemental form, and any equipment that the earth elemental form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the earth elemental form has no effect until you revert back to your normal form.
