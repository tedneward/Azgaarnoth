# Arcane Tradition: Geomancy
Geomancy wizards are the kind of wizard who
appreciate the sturdiness and stability of earth magic.
The world of stone, dirt, and rock is fi rm, hardy and
strong. A wizard who learns to harness the magic of
the earth can become a hardy practitioner of magic; one
who can withstand even the toughest of foes.

Geomancer's Knowledge
Starting at 2nd level, your affi nity for utilizing stone and
the earth has become second nature for you. You have
advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide
in rocky terrain, and advantage on Constitution saving
throws to maintain your concentration while in rocky
terrain.
Additionally, the following spells are added to the
wizard spell list for you: bones of the earth, earthquake,
magic stone, and meld into stone.
Stone Form
At 6th level, as an action, you can transform yourself
temporarily into stone form, your skin hardening
and taking on a number of characteristics of an earth
elemental. You can use this feature twice and you regain
expended uses after fi nishing a long rest.
Whilst in stone form, you gain a +2 bonus to AC,
you are immune to the poisoned condition and have
immunity to poison damage, and you have resistance to
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical
weapons. Additionally, your movement speed is
reduced by 10 feet and you have disadvantage on
Dexterity saving throws.
You maintain your stone form for 1 hour unless
you end it early using a bonus action. If you fall
unconscious, drop to zero hit points, or die, you
automatically revert to your normal form.
Protection of the Earth
Beginning at 10th level, if you revert back to your
normal form from your stone form as a result of the
duration time of 1 hour has expired, or by using your
bonus action to do so, you gain temporary hit points
equal to your wizard level + your Constitution modifi er.
Master Geomancer
At 14th level, you can use your stone form ability an
additional number of times equal to your Intelligence
modifi er (minimum of 1). You can expend 2 uses of
your stone form ability to instead transform into the
form of an earth elemental (MM p.124). Whilst in earth
elemental form, you can speak any languages you
know.
While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
• Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics
of the earth elemental, but you retain your
alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your
skill and saving throw profi ciencies, in addition to
gaining those of the earth elemental. If the earth
elemental has the same profi ciency as you and the
bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the
earth elemental’s bonus instead of yours.
• You can’t cast spells while transformed.
Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on
a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you
from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as
rain of stones (see below), that you’ve already cast.
• You retain the benefi t of any features from your
class, race, or other source and can use them if the
earth elemental form is physically capable of doing
so. However, you can’t use any special senses that
you might have (such as darkvision) unless the
earth elemental also has that sense.
• You choose whether your equipment falls to the
ground in your space, merges into your earth
elemental form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment
functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it
is practical for the earth elemental to wear a piece
of equipment based on the earth elemental’s shape
and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or
shape to match the earth elemental form, and any
equipment that the earth elemental form can’t wear
must either fall to the ground or merge with it.
Equipment that merges with the earth elemental
form has no effect until you revert back to your
normal form.
