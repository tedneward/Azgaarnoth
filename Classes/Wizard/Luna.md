# Arcane Tradition: Luna Magi
A wizard of phases and a master of radiant damage, you use the moons as a conduit for your grasp on the weave of magic. When the four moons of Azgaarnoth are at high sanction, and thus closer to the world, your hold on the weave is at its strongest and your power magnified. Likewise, when they are at the lowest sanction of their cycle, your hold on the weave is at its weakest and your power dulled. 

Luna magi are always members of (or former members of) the [Four Moons](../../Organizations/MageSchools/FourMoons.md) school.

## Radiance of the Night
*2nd-level Luna feature*

You also know the [sacred flame](../../Magic/Spells/sacred-flame.md) cantrip which burns silver with moonlight.

## Lunar Link
*2nd-level Luna feature*

You gain a connection with the moons as a conduit to the magical weave; in particular, you choose one of the four moons of Azgaarnoth as your source of lunar power. As such, when that moon are in either high sanction or low sanction phases, you gain the following benefits or constraints:

Moon Phase  | Effect
----------- | ------
Full Moon   | +1 to Spellcasting DC
Waning Moon | No Effect
New Moon    | -1 to Spellcasting DC
Waxing Moon | No Effect

## Moon Shadows
*6th-level Luna feature*

When you are within 60 feet of a beam of moonlight, your connection with the moons allows you to bend this reflective shine within a 5-foot radius for up to 1 minute, even during the daylight hours. When using this in combination with making a Dexterity (Stealth) check, you do so with advantage. You can also use this ability to hide objects smaller than 5 feet wide, or other willing creatures that are Medium or smaller, for up to 1 minute. Any creature searching for such a hidden object or creature while the Moon Shadows ability is in effect must succeed on a Wisdom (Perception) check versus your Spell save DC to see it.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you have finished a short or long rest. 

## Lunar Retribution
*10th-level Luna feature*

As a reaction to a melee attack that hits you, you release a wave of lunar energies to rebuke your attacker. When successfully hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make Wisdom saving throw against your Spell save DC, taking 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) in psychic damage on failed save, as they suffer a bout of moon madness from the exposure. If the attack was a critical hit, this damage is doubled. 

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once) and you regain all expended uses after completing a long rest.

## Radiant Mastery
*14th-level Luna feature*

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a radiant damage die, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.
