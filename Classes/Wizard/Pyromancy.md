# Arcane Tradition: Pyromancy
The pyromancer is the elemental master of fi re. While
many mages can conjure fi re for blasts of devastating
energy, the pyromancer understands the primal nature
of fi re, heat, and the deeper secrets of the multiverse –
that elemental fl ame is one of the fundamental building
blocks of all creation. And while it’s most basic nature
can be turned to destruction, the subtle nuances of
its uses go far beyond that. Pyromancers embrace
all aspects of heat, fi re, and fl ame knowing that all
creatures are connected to the elements, and fl ames can
cleanse as well as consume.

Fire Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level,
the gold and time you must spend to copy a fi re-based
spell into your spellbook is halved. A fi re-based spell is
defi ned by having fi re, fl ame, or heat in its name.
Fireshaper
Starting at 2nd level, as a bonus action, you are able to
exert infl uence on any non-magical fl ame that you can
see within 60 feet and that is no larger than a 5 -foot
cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:
• You instantaneously expand the fl ame 5 feet in
one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is
present in the new location.
• You instantaneously extinguish the fl ames.
• You can double or halve the area of bright light and
dim light cast by the fl ame, change its color, or both.
These changes last for 1 hour.
• You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form
of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to
appear and animate within the fl ames, as you like.
These shapes last for 1 hour.
This ability replicates the effects of the control fl ames
cantrip, but is not considered a spell.
Heart of Fire
Starting at 6th level, you take no damage from natural
or mundane sources of fl ame or heat and you gain
immunity to environmental, heat-based exhaustion. You
also have advantage on saving throws against fi re-based
spells and effects.
Heat Channeling
Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action, you can siphon
fi re and heat from natural or magical sources to fuel
your abilities. By drawing the residual heat from your
environment, dropping the temperature noticeably for
a moment, and extinguishing any natural fl ames within
10 feet of you, the power of your fi re-based spells is
magnifi ed, allowing you to add your wizard level to
the damage of all your fi re or heat-based spells. If the
spell affects multiple targets, select one target to take
the additional damage. You regain the use of this ability
after a short or long rest.
Piercing Flames
Starting at 14th level, fi re and fl ames you generate are
so hot they pierce most protections. Your spells and
abilities ignore resistance to fi re damage, and creatures
immune to fi re damage take fi re damage equal to your
Intelligence modifi er (minimum of 1) instead.

# Pyromancy Spells
Pure Flame
1st-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You conjure a flame, tinged with holy energy, and
apply it to a wound. The target creature regains 1d4
hit points and if suffering from the effects of disease or
poison due to failing a saving throw, the target creature
can immediately make a new saving throw, ending the
effect on itself on a success.
This is a painful treatment option, however, and the
affected creature makes attack rolls and skill checks at
disadvantage on its turn.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by
1d4 for each slot level above 1st.
Curse of Combustion
5th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a fire-blackened chunk of quartz)
Duration: 1 hour
You place a magical command on a creature within
range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain
from some action or course of activity as you decide.
If the creature understands you, it must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for
the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it
takes 1d10 fire damage each time it acts in a manner
directly counter to your instructions, but no more than
once per minute. A creature that can’t understand you is
unaffected by the spell.
You can issue any command you choose, short of an
activity that would result in certain death. Should you
issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.
You can end the spell early by using an action to
dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell
also ends it.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases
by one hour for each slot level above 5th.
Fire Trap
4th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S, M (a blown glass sphere)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You conjure an immobile, invisible, 1-foot-radius
sphere of force that attracts and absorbs all heat
and fire in its vicinity. Any natural or magical fire
effect that is produced or passes within 10 feet of the
sphere, is immediately drawn into the sphere without
manifesting. All fire damage drawn into the sphere is
still rolled and/or recorded. Once active, the sphere
visibly roils with trapped fire energy. Any fire within
the sphere when the spell ends, either by ceasing
concentration or reaching duration, is harmlessly
shunted to the elemental plane of fire.
The sphere can absorb an amount of fire damage
equal to five times your wizard level. If the capacity of
the sphere is exceeded before ended by you, it explodes
in a 20-foot-radius centered on the sphere, with all
creatures, objects, and structures in the area taking
fire damage equal to the total of the sphere’s holding
capacity.
Greater Fire Trap
6th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S, M (a blown glass sphere)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This spell functions as the heat trap spell, except the
sphere can absorb fire damage up to 10 times your
wizard level. In addition when the spell ends you
can choose if the fire is harmlessly dispersed to the
elemental plane of fire, or is discharged in a destructive
explosion as per the heat trap spell.
Pyroclastic Cataclysm
9th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (a chunk of volcanic rock)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You evoke a massive fiery conflagration of titanic
proportions; a roiling pyroclastic firestorm 60 feet in
diameter. The forces involved buffet and crash into
any creatures within the area, and the area within the
firestorm is considered difficult terrain. When a creature
enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or
starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity
saving throw, taking 15d8 fire damage on a failed save,
or half as much on a successful one.
As a bonus action, you can move the conflagration 20
feet in any direction, including upwards or downwards.
