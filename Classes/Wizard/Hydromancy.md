# Arcane Tradition: Hydromancy
Water, the source of all life, can be a formidable foe or a wondrous ally. Wizards of the school of hydromancy study the elemental magic of water. These wizards know that water magic is a delicate practice. After all, water, being the fl uid that it is, is all about maintaining a fine balance. In its purest liquid form, it is flowing.  Too cold and it becomes solid ice, too hot and it becomes piping steam. A hydromancer wizard seeks to maintain a balanced life, much like water but also sees the practicality of being fl uid and adaptable, as water can be.

## Affinity for Water
Starting at 2nd level, your affi nity for water, and all its uses, has aided you in learning how to adapt to its nature. You have a swim speed of 30 feet. Additionally, you can breathe both air and water.

## Liquefy
Beginning at 6th level, as an action, one inanimate object that you touch is turned into pure water, destroying the object in the process. The object must weigh less than 30 pounds and must be able to fit inside a 1-foot cube. Magic items are unaffected by this ability. Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until after you have completed a short or long rest.

## Geyser
At 10th level, you can summon a powerful surge of water from deep within the ground. As an action, you touch the ground, calling forth the water beneath.

Choose a point within 60 feet of you that you can see. A 5-foot radius geyser erupts from the ground at that point. Any creatures in the geyser’s area are pushed 10 feet away from the center of the geyser, taking 4d8 bludgeoning damage as they are blasted with boiling water.

The geyser remains in the area for 2d4 hours.

Creatures forced out of the area of the geyser are unable to re-enter the area. Water from the geyser cannot be contained or collected in any shape or form. After the water gushes forth, it returns back into the ground in a cyclic motion, leaving the area as it was before the geyser appeared. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until after you have completed a long rest.

## Fountain of Youth
Starting at 14th level, the magic of water lives in every cell of your body. You do not suffer the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You no longer need to drink water to sustain your life. The waters of life cleanse you of impurities, giving you immunity to disease, immunity to poison damage, and immunity to the poisoned condition.
