# Arcane Tradition: Hydromancy
Water, the source of all life, can be a formidable foe or
a wondrous ally. Wizards of the school of hydromancy
study the elemental magic of water. These wizards
know that water magic is a delicate practice. After all,
water, being the fl uid that it is, is all about maintaining
a fi ne balance. In its purest liquid form, it is fl owing.
Too cold and it becomes solid ice, too hot and it
becomes piping steam. A hydromancer wizard seeks to
maintain a balanced life, much like water but also sees
the practicality of being fl uid and adaptable, as water
can be.

Affinity for Water
Starting at 2nd level, your affi nity for water, and all
its uses, has aided you in learning how to adapt to its
nature. You have a swim speed of 30 feet. Additionally,
you can breathe both air and water.
Liquefy
Beginning at 6th level, as an action, one inanimate object
that you touch is turned into pure water, destroying the
object in the process. The object must weigh less than
30 pounds and must be able to fi t inside a 1-foot cube.
Magic items are unaffected by this ability. Once you
have used this feature, you cannot use it again until
after you have completed a short or long rest.
Geyser
At 10th level, you can summon a powerful surge of
water from deep within the ground. As an action, you
touch the ground, calling forth the water beneath.
Choose a point within 60 feet of you that you can see.
A 5-foot radius geyser erupts from the ground at that
point. Any creatures in the geyser’s area are pushed
10 feet away from the center of the geyser, taking 4d8
bludgeoning damage as they are blasted with boiling
water.
The geyser remains in the area for 2d4 hours.
Creatures forced out of the area of the geyser are unable
to re-enter the area. Water from the geyser cannot be
contained or collected in any shape or form. After the
water gushes forth, it returns back into the ground in
a cyclic motion, leaving the area as it was before the
geyser appeared. Once you use this feature, you cannot
use it again until after you have completed a long rest.
Fountain of Youth
Starting at 14th level, the magic of water lives in every
cell of your body. You do not suffer the frailty of old
age, and you can’t be aged magically. You no longer
need to drink water to sustain your life. The waters of
life cleanse you of impurities, giving you immunity to
disease, immunity to poison damage, and immunity to
the poisoned condition.

# Hydromancy Spells
Command Water
4th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a water source)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You command a small body of water (at least one
barrel-full of water or approximately 200 litres or 52
gallons) to spring to life to do your bidding. The water
forms into a water weird (MM p. 299), which comes
forth from the water and moves into an unoccupied
space within 10 feet of the source. The water weird
disappears when it drops to zero hit points, or when
the spell ends. The water weird is friendly to you and
your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for
the water weird, which has its own turns. It obeys
any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action
required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to
the water weird, it defends itself from hostile creatures
but otherwise takes no actions.
If your concentration is broken, the water weird
doesn’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the
water weird, it becomes hostile toward you and your
companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled
elemental can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears
1 hour after you summoned it.
The DM has the water weird’s statistics.
Rain
2nd-level conjuration (ritual)
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Self (100-foot radius)
Components: V, S, M (a small vial of rainwater)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You must be outdoors to cast this spell. The spell ends
if you move to an area without line of sight to the sky.
When you cast the spell, you conjure rain clouds in
the sky directly above you within a 100-foot radius,
centered on you for the duration. You can cause the
area to experience rainfall. You can not change any
other aspect of the weather. The rainfall is mild, and
it can warm or cool the ambient temperature by up to
5 degrees Fahrenheit. It causes all objects to become
wet and reduces their combustibility accordingly. The
rainfall is suffi cient to extinguish small fi res (such as
a campfi re) within 1 round, signifi cant fi res (such as a
house fi re) within 1 minute, and raging infernos (such
as a wildfi re) within 10 minutes. When the spell ends,
the weather gradually returns to its original conditions
over the course of a 10 minute period.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the area of effect
doubles for each slot level above 2nd (3rd level; 200-
foot radius, 4th level; 400-foot radius, 5th level; 800-foot
radius, and so on).
Scalding Sphere
1st-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You conjure a small sphere of scalding hot water. The
sphere hovers just above your hand, and is no larger
than your head in size. Make a ranged spell attack
against a target that you can see within 30 feet of you.
On a hit, the target takes 3d8 fi re damage from the
scalding water.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
Water Lasso
3rd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a rope at least 20 feet long)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You conjure a lasso made of water. Make a ranged spell
attack against a target that you can see within range.
On a hit, the water lasso wraps its watery coils around
the target, and the target is restrained. The creature can
make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your
spell save DC at the end of each of its turns to break free
from the lasso. On each of your turns, if the target is still
restrained by the water lasso, you can pull the target up
to 10 feet in a straight line toward you.
