# Arcane Tradition: Hemomancy
Hemomancy is one of the most forbidden realms of magic that a wizard can delve into, but there will inevitably be those who can't be deterred from the grisly pursuit of blood magic and the raw power it can offer. There is magical energy in the blood of all living things - magic which can be used to fuel any school of spell - and this school teaches its students to harness that energy, no matter the cost. Of course, blood mages often prefer that cost to be paid by someone else.

Hemomancers are not always villainous, even though they are almost always feared or despised. Some blood wizards practice their art as a necessary means to gain the power they need to defeat monsters or save others. Yet hemomancy is a forbidden magic, forcing wizards who pursue it to mark their own path by experimenting and crafting their own hemomancies. And this study of hemomancy often pushes blood wizards to test their spells on living subjects, seeking those with more and more powerful blood Such pursuits do make it easier to adopt an evil alignment, which might be part of why the school is generally forbidden and reviled.

## Hemomancy Savant
*2nd-level Hemomancy feature*

You can choose up to one spell in your spellbook that is not a Blood spell. It becomes a Blood spell in addition to its other schools, and you can choose to change its name to fit the spell's new form, such as changing *chromatic orb* to *chromatic bloodbolt* or changing *magic missile* to *crimson missile*. In the future, you are always able to copy the original spell into your spellbook as that Blood spen even if your spell book must be replaced. Each time you gain a wizard leveL you can do this to another spell in your spellbook.

Finally, the gold and time you must spend to copy a Blood spell into your spellbook is halved. This doesn't affect any spell that you've made into a Blood spell by using this feature.

## Blood Recovery
*2nd-level Hemomancy feature*

When a Blood spell you cast deals damage to a creature that has blood, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1 + your wizard level / 3 which last for 1 minute, and you can also choose to steal the blood's magical energy for yourself.

If you do, you instantly regain spell slots by activating your Arcane Recovery feature as if you had completed a short rest, expending it as normal You can't do so if you've already used that feature since finishing your last long rest.

## Hematurgy
*6th-level Hemomancy feature*

You gain the ability to cast beyond your limits by sacrificing the vital life force inside your own blood As a bonus action, you can spill your own blood and spend up to 5 of your remaining hit dice, but instead of healing you take 1d8 necrotic damage per hit dice expended that ignores resistance and immunity.

The next wizard spell you cast on this turn is also a Blood spell in addition to its other schools and does not require a spell slot if it would normally expend a spell slot of a spell level equal to or less than the number of hit dice you expended on this feature.

You can't use this feature to cast a spell at a level higher than you have spell slots for, and you can't expend more hit dice using this feature than your wizard level divided by 3 before finishing a long rest.

## Spell Clot
*10th-level Hemomancy feature*

You learn how to weave the blood of your foes into spells from within their very veins. When you deal damage to a creature that has blood using a Blood spelL you can cast another Blood spell that normally requires an action as a bonus action on that turn. If the spell targets creatures, it must target the creature you damaged, and if it targets a location, it must target the damaged creature's location.

Once you have used this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Red Harvest
*14th-level Hemomancy feature*

You master the art of blood magic. When a Blood spell you cast reduces a creature that has blood to 0 hit points, you can steal energy from its blood and gain a charge for this feature. You can store a maximum of three charges at once. You can expend up to three charges on your turn to cast a wizard spell of a spell slot level equal to the number of charges expended without expending a spell slot.

When you finish a short or long rest, you lose all your charges for this feature. Once you've gained a number of charges equal to your wizard level divided by 3, you can't gain any more charges until you finish a long rest.
