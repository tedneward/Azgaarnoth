# Arcane Tradition: Emomancy
Practitioners of emomancy often term themselves as emomantics rather than emomancers and specialize in the subtle magic of emotions. 

Emomantics generally eschew the clumsy "brute force" charms and dominations in favor of delicately manipulating the existing emotions of creatures. While most emomantics prefer to focus on enhancing positive emotions, all see value in pacifying destructive urges inherent in passionate beings.

Like [enchanters](Enchantment.md), emomantics are often deeply distrusted by all walks of life, and in [Travenia](../../Nations/Travenia.md) the practice of emomancy is openly banned. Despite the open hostility to emomancy, the tradition carries on, which suggests that emomantic masters are far more subtle than most believe--or they have clandestine support from various quarters.

## Bonus Proficiencies
Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with the Insight skill if you don't already have it, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make when using this skill.

## Sense Emotions
Beginning at 2nd level, as an action, you can sense strong or extreme emotions in a radius of 20 feet of you.

Until the end of your next turn, you know the emotional state of all creatures within the radius. Anger, anguish, contentment, envy, fear, hate, joy, longing, and love are common, but at the DM's discretion, more subtle variations may be perceived if strong enough. This ability senses only strong emotions, so only the most overwhelming emotional states can be sensed.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Emotional Stability
Starting at 6th level, you become immune to the frightened condition and have advantage on saving throws against being charmed.

## Irresistible Emotions
At 10th level, your spells that affect emotions are difficult to resist. You can select a single creature and impose disadvantage on saving throws it makes to resist the effects of an emotion affecting spell that you cast. This includes all the spells listed in this archetype, all spells that cause the frightened condition and calm emotions. The DM may, at their discretion, add other spells to this list. You regain the use of this ability after fi nishing a short rest.

## Emotion Overwhelming
Starting at 14th level, you are able to project an aura of overwhelming emotion, sharing your current emotional state with all creatures within a 30-foot radius, centered on you, and magnified many times over. The aura moves with you. In addition to sharing an emotional mood which all creatures understand to be yours, it generates one of the following effects of your choice:

* Positive Emotions – all creatures within the aura have advantage on all skill checks and saving throws.
* Negative Emotions – all creatures within the aura have disadvantage on all skill checks and saving throws.

Unwilling creatures can make a successful Charisma saving throw to resist the effects. The aura lasts for 1 minute, and after using this ability you cannot use it again until after you have completed a long rest.
