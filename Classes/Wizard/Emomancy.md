# Arcane Tradition: Emomancy
Practitioners of emomancy often term themselves as
emomantics rather than emomancers and specialize in
the subtle magic of emotions. Emomantics generally
eschew the clumsy “brute force” charms and
dominations in favor of delicately manipulating the
existing emotions of creatures. While most emomantics
prefer to focus on enhancing positive emotions, all
see value in pacifying destructive urges inherent in
passionate beings.

Bonus Proficiencies
Starting at 2nd level, you gain profi ciency with the
Insight skill if you don’t already have it, and your
profi ciency bonus is doubled for any ability check you
make when using this skill.
Sense Emotions
Beginning at 2nd level, as an action, you can sense
strong or extreme emotions in a radius of 20 feet of you.
Until the end of your next turn, you know the emotional
state of all creatures within the radius. Anger, anguish,
contentment, envy, fear, hate, joy, longing, and love
are common, but at the DM’s discretion, more subtle
variations may be perceived if strong enough. This
ability senses only strong emotions, so only the most
overwhelming emotional states can be sensed.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to
1+ your Intelligence modifi er (minimum of once),
regaining all expended uses when you fi nish a long rest.
Emotional Stability
Starting at 6th level, you become immune to the
frightened condition and have advantage on saving
throws against being charmed.
Irresistible Emotions
At 10th level, your spells that affect emotions are
diffi cult to resist. You can select a single creature and
impose disadvantage on saving throws it makes to
resist the effects of an emotion affecting spell that you
cast. This includes all the spells listed in this archetype,
all spells that cause the frightened condition and calm
emotions. The DM may, at their discretion, add other
spells to this list. You regain the use of this ability after
fi nishing a short rest.
Emotion Overwhelming
Starting at 14th level, you are able to project an aura of
overwhelming emotion, sharing your current emotional
state with all creatures within a 30-foot radius, centered
on you, and magnifi ed many times over. The aura
moves with you. In addition to sharing an emotional
mood which all creatures understand to be yours, it
generates one of the following effects of your choice:
• Positive Emotions – all creatures within the aura
have advantage on all skill checks and saving
throws.
• Negative Emotions – all creatures within the aura
have disadvantage on all skill checks and saving
throws.
Unwilling creatures can make a successful Charisma
saving throw to resist the effects. The aura lasts for 1
minute, and after using this ability you cannot use it
again until after you have completed a long rest.

# Emomancy Spells
Exemplar of Self
9th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a mirror)
Duration: 1 minute
You select one creature within range and positively
fortify their physical and mental well being to virtually
unassailable levels. They become immune to all
conditions, and all current, ongoing conditions are
ended. All ability checks are automatically successful
as their confidence and competence soars to near
unattainable heights.
At the end of the spell the affected creature must
make a Charisma saving throw or become despondent
at the loss of the positive emotion, gaining a level of
exhaustion.
Dishearten
1st-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, M (an object that causes you sorrow)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You choose a spot within range and momentarily create
a 20-foot cube of negative, sorrowful, and disheartening
emotion. Each creature within the area of effect when
the spell is cast must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls until the
effect ends. An affected creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.
Passionate Pursuit
2nd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (an object you are passionate
about)
Duration: 1 hour
You touch a creature and increase their emotional
excitement and passion for one skill, tool, or instrument.
For the duration, the creature has advantage on all
ability checks associated with that passion.
Positive Foundations
1st-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: S, M (a personal, treasured childhood
possession)
Duration: 10 minutes
You select a single creature within range and, with
a smile and some gentle, neutral gestures, influence
their emotions just enough to put them at ease in
your presence. This is not a charm, it merely reduces
suspicion, and enhances their willingness to be receptive
to your positive interactions. The target creature
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
indifferent toward you (if they were hostile) and open
to dialogue. For the duration, you have advantage on
Charisma (Persuasion) checks, but disadvantage on
Charisma (Deception) checks. This spell grants you
no influence on the creature but removes social and
emotional impediments to interaction. If you act in ways
counter to the target’s interests or natural inclinations,
the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
Suspicion and Doubt
3rd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: S, M (a broken friendship bracelet)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of negative emotion
that increases suspicion and doubt. All creatures in the
area when the spell is cast must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or it immediately becomes suspicious of
the motivations of all others. A creature can voluntarily
fail its saving throw. Affected creatures have advantage
on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and if under the effects
of the charmed condition, they can immediately make
a new saving throw with advantage to end that effect.
Additionally, affected creatures have disadvantage on
Charisma (Persuasion) checks as their social manner
shifts to closed off and guarded.
Symbiotic Confidence
2nd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a friendship bracelet)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You select two creatures within range that gain
confidence from each other’s presence. While within 5
feet of each other, each creature has advantage on attack
rolls and cannot be frightened.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
Unshakable Self Awareness
5th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a mirror)
Duration: 1 hour
You select one creature within range, and positively
fortify their self-image and self-awareness. For the
duration, all effects of the charmed condition that the
target creature is under, are suspended. The target
creature is immune to the charmed, frightened and
stunned conditions, and makes all ability checks with
advantage. Additionally, they gain inspiration if they
do not already have it, which can be used at any time
during this effect.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 5th.
