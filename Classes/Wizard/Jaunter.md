# Arcane Tradition: Jaunter
Jaunter wizards are infamous for showing up precisely whenever and wherever they want (generally while claiming they were needed). This procedure, when enacted by most conjurers of cheap spells, is less accurate on both the ‘where' and ‘when' than most wizards would like to admit. However, there are those with exceptional talent, with incredible spatial awareness, to which conjuration magic turns distance into a thing of the past, and the past into a grip to hoist themselves onto tomorrow. In short: they are wizards with a gift for twisting time and space.

Being a Jaunter means having some tie (past or present) to the [Spinning Hands](../../Organizations/MageSchools/SpinningHands.md) mage school.

## Yesterday's Preparations
Starting at 2nd level, you can reach into your own past to grab items that you have set aside for emergencies.

As an action, you can summon a nonmagical item that you have access to. The item must be unattended, and something you've intentionally touched.

This item persists for 1 minute or until it leaves your hand, and then immediately returns to the time and place it was pulled from. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses after completing a long rest.

## Empowered Conjuration
Starting at 2nd level, when you cast a conjuration spell and do not use a higher level spell slot to cast the spell, the spell is cast as though you used a spell slot one level higher than the one you used. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses after completing a long rest.

## Tesseract
Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you can bridge two points in space. Choose two points within 30 feet of you. A 5-foot square now surrounds each of these points, which now become adjacent to each other (you choose which sides of each square touch). Any creature, spell, or object entering the square exits from the other square as if the two were adjacent to each other. Creatures can attack or cross between the points as though they were connected. Spells and ranged attacks can be made across these two squares. For a creature to benefi t from cover, it must also have cover against these two points. These points remain connected until the start of your next
turn. You can use your action each round to maintain this effect. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifi er (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses after completing a long rest.

## Strange Eons
Starting at 10th level, you twist time and space, rendering spells wildly unstable. As a reaction to seeing another creature casting a spell that has a duration other than instantaneous or concentration, you alter the spell's duration to require concentration. If the creature loses concentration or casts another spell that requires concentration, the target spell ends. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses after finishing a long rest.

## Master of Time and Space
Starting at 14th level, whenever you cast a conjuration spell with a duration that requires concentration, if the spell reaches its maximum duration before ending, you regain the spell slot used to cast it. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), regaining all expended uses after completing a long rest.
