# Arcane Tradition: Scrymancy
The scrymancers are the spies amongst the wizarding
schools. While not as adroit with a blade as their
roguish counterparts, they have just as many tools to
stay out of sight. Focused on gathering information
they can use to expand their spell list and help their
allies gain a tactical advantage, these divination-leaning
wizards are readily employed by any entity that values
security, knowledge, or tracking.


Eyes That See
At 2nd level, you learn little tricks to see the hidden.
You add the faerie fire spell to your spellbook.
Stealthy Casting
Aso at 2nd level, you’ve learned how to cast spells
without being detected. As part of casting a spell, you
can make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. All creatures with
a passive Perception lower than the total of your roll do
not notice you casting the spell. You gain proficiency in
the Stealth skill if you don’t already have it, and casting
a spell only reveals your position if you inflict damage
on a creature or object.
The power of Sight
At 6th level, when you use a divination spell to detect a
creature you wouldn’t otherwise be able to see or hear,
you also gain a glimpse into the creature’s mind. You
gain a vague notion of their current motivation or goal.
For the next 8 hours, you have advantage on Charisma
(Persuasion), Charisma (Intimidation), and Charisma
(Deception) checks against that creature. You can only
affect one creature at a time with this feature, and
targeting a new creature with this feature ends the effect
on the current creature.
Your Sight is Mine
At 10th level, when a creature fails a saving throw
against a spell you cast, you can use a bonus action to
force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw
or be blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. You can use this ability a
number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier
(minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of
this ability when you finish a long rest.
Eyes of the Magi
At 14th level, your spells fuel your perception. When
you cast a divination spell, for 1 minute, you gain
truesight out to a range of 60 feet. You also gain
advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks for that
duration. Alternatively, you can transfer this power
to another creature that you can touch, but only one
creature can benefit from this effect at a time. You
cannot use this ability again until you finish a short or
long rest.

# Scrymancy Spells
Greater Darkness
6th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a jet worth at least 100 gp)
Duration: 30 minutes
Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose
within range to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere for the
duration. The darkness spreads around corners.
A creature with darkvision can't see through this
darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.
If the point you choose is on an object you are holding
or one that isn't being worn or carried, the darkness
emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely
covering the source of the darkness with an opaque
object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.
If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light
created by a spell of 6th level or lower, the spell that
created the light is dispelled.
Greater Telepathic Bond
8th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
You forge a telepathic link with one willing creature of
your choice within range. Creatures with Intelligence
scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this spell. The spell
ends if you and the creature are ever on a different
plane, or are more than one mile apart.
Until the spell ends, you and the creature can
communicate telepathically through the bond, whether
or not you share a common language. Additionally, you
share each other’s senses, and any beneficial racial trait,
spell, or effect that enhances the senses or perception of
one creature, affects the other.
Finally, whenever you use your action to cast a spell,
you can determine the spell’s range as though you were
standing in the linked creature’s space. If you cast a
spell with a range of self, you can have it affect you or
the linked creature.
Piercing Vision
Divination cantrip
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Touch
Components: S
Duration: 1 round
Until the end of its next turn, the target has advantage
on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect hidden
creatures, and their attacks ignore all but full cover.
Predict Action
7th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 6 miles
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You target a creature you can see (but is not necessarily
in your line of sight) within range and make one of the
following predictions about what they will do on their
next turn:
• Attack: You predict with what weapon or whom
they will attack.
• Use Tactics: You predict if they will use the Hide,
Dash, Dodge, or Disengage action.
• Cast a Spell: You predict if they will cast a spell.
If the target does what you predicted on their next
turn, they must make a Constitution saving throw,
taking 12d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as
much on a successful one. The DM determines how well
the creature’s actions match the criteria the caster set
forth.
X-ray Vision
3rd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
You grant yourself the ability to see through solid
surfaces. For the duration, as a bonus action, you can
touch a 5-foot by 5-foot surface through which your
sight can now penetrate. You see a vague outline of any
creature, item, or terrain that is on the other side of the
surface, to a depth of 20 feet. The spell can penetrate
most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch
of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
or dirt.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th-level or higher, the duration of the spell
is increased by 10 minutes for each slot level above the
3rd.
