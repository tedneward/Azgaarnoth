# Bloodmancer
*"My blood courses with arcane power; your blood will simply spill from your body."*

Blood mages learn to heighten their spellcraft by uniting the power of blood and arcane might. Blood is life, though wizards that travel this path of magic view the sanguine fluid flowing through their veins as a wellspring of arcane power.

Blood mages often forgo tradition, seeing it as a hindrance toward obtaining knowledge rather than a foundation. Since very few understand their motives and lack of regard for proven arcane conventions, many believe they are free spirits.

This is often a misperception. Blood mages may not confine themselves to the laborious task of scribing spells, but will instead focus that energy into a structured dance and exercise. This deliberate movement of the body increases the flow of blood and intertwines its power with the Weave.

## A Tale of Two Traditions
For a time, in the ancient days, the art of using the blood as power was threatened with extinction. Vigorous prosecution by various arcane and divine organizations had reduced those who practiced its skills down to a mere handful. As a result, instruction suffered; students were forced to improvise and learn on their own, rather than build upon what those before them had studied.

Over time, the traditions of the bloodmancer varied and broke away from the ancient ways, and although the ancient ways eventually reasserted themselves centuries later, by that time already a new tradition had been born, colloquially called the ["neobloodmancer"](./NeoBloodmancer.md). Those that learn the original path are referred more simply as "bloodmancers".

## Blood Savant
You combine the source of your arcane power with the blood flowing through your veins. When you select this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine and double your proficiency bonus to any check made with the skill, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

Furthermore, when you perform the Arcane Recovery feature, you also regain 1 expended hit die.

## Blood Magic
Starting at 2nd level, you invoke blood magic to gain supernatural powers. You can use a bonus action to call upon the power of blood by either inflicting a minor or severe wound upon yourself.

**Minor Wound.** Inflicting a minor wound requires the expenditure of 1 hit die. Instead of regaining hit points, you gain 1 blood point.

**Severe Wound.** Inflicting a severe wound requires the expenditure of 2 hit dice. Instead of regaining hit points, you gain 2 blood points.

While you possess one or more blood points, you gain the following features:

* **Armor of Vitality.** When you do not wear armor, your AC equals 13 + your Constitution modifier.

* **Lifeblood.** You gain advantage on your first death saving throw of the day.

Furthermore, you can expend blood points to perform the following blood rituals:

* **Blood Agony.** When you hit a creature with a melee or spell attack, you can expend 1 or more blood points to deal psychic damage to the target, in addition to the damage of the attack. The extra damage is 1d6 for 1 blood point, plus 1d6 for each additional blood point, to a maximum of 5d6.
    At 14th level, increase the damage die of Blood Agony to a d8.

* **Blood Sense.** The sound of blood pumping in the veins of the living registers upon your senses like a soothing rhythm upon your being. Expend 1 blood point as an action to focus your awareness upon the immediate area to reveal the presence of living creatures. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any beast, giant, or humanoid, within 60 feet that is not behind total cover. You know the type of any being whose presence you sense, but not the identity of the creature.

* **Fortitude of Blood.** Expend 1 blood point as a bonus action to gain a bonus to Constitution saving throws, which lasts for 1 minute, equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
    You can invoke this ritual twice. Afterward, you cannot perform it again until you finish a short or long rest.

After a long rest, unexpended blood points vanish.

## Burn the Blood
At 6th level, you gain resistance to psychic and fire damage. Furthermore, whenever you begin casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals psychic or fire damage, a wave of pain and anguish erupts from you. This wave causes creatures of your choice within 10 feet to suffer psychic or fire damage (you choose each time you activate this feature) equal to half your wizard level.

## Cull the Blood
At 6th level, you learn to manipulate the flow blood, even if it is not your own, to either stem death or empower your blood magic.

* **Blood Siphon.** When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee or spell attack, and the creature dies, you gain 1 blood point.

* **Mark of Blood.** When an attack scores a critical hit against a living creature within 10 feet, you can spend 1 blood point as a reaction. Until the end of your next turn, you gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature.

* **Wellspring of Life.** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 19-20 on the d20, you regain 1d6 hit points instead of normal. At 14th level, you regain 1d6 hits points when you instead roll a 18-20 on a death saving throw.

## Inheritor of Blood
At 10th level, you can invoke the power of blood in others to bind your wounds. Should you drop to 0 hit points and do not die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, one willing creature within 30 feet can expend one hit die and you regain a number of hit points equal to the result.

Each time you use this feature after the first, increase the DC by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, reset the DC to 10.

## Soul Burn
At 10th level, you can transform the blood within your veins into raw arcane power. As a bonus action on your turn, expend one or more blood points to create one spell slot. For each blood point you expend, roll 1d6 and consult the following Creating Spell Slots table for the result. You cannot create a spell slot higher than 5th level.

Dice Result | Spell Slot Gained
----------- | -----------
7-9   | 1st 
10-16 | 2nd
17-20 | 3rd
21-23 | 4th
24+   | 5th

## Blood Soul Magus
When you achieve 14th level, you learned the final secret of weaving blood and raw arcane power into one source of magic. When you inflict a minor or severe wound through your Blood Magic feature, you gain a greater number of blood points. When you inflict a minor wound, instead gain 2 blood points, while a severe wound yields 4 blood points.
