# Arcane Tradition: Voidmancy
Voidmancy is the dangerous fi eld of study of the dark
and aberrant things that lie on the edge of reality.
Things that stretch the mental fortitude of those that
wish to see into the beyond. Many describe it as the
discovery of knowledge that no mortal is meant to
know, and the sheer number of madness-inducing
contacts with such places and beings suggests there’s
some merit to this theory. Voidmancers seek to
uncover these hidden truths in a methodical and –
theoretically – safe way, through the rigid study of
abjurations to protect themselves, and divinations to
limit discoveries to manageable slivers. Voidmancers
believe that scholars, cultists, and warlocks that touch
the other side, do so recklessly, and thus they are
consumed. Voidmancers believe that strict adherence
to methodology and mental discipline, allows them to
ward off a similar fate.

Bonus Proficiencies and Spells
Starting at 2nd level, you gain profi ciency in the
Arcana skill, and you double your profi ciency bonus
when making Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to
aberrations. In addition, armor of Agathys, arms of Hadar,
and hunger of Hadar are added to the wizard spell list for
you.
Whispers from the Void
Starting at 2nd level, you constantly hear whispers
from the otherworld. Though trained to block out most
of these maddening sounds, occasionally a few useful
scraps of knowledge can be gleaned. Whenever you
make a skill check, you can roll an additional 2d4 and
add it to the total. This must be done after you roll the
die, but before the outcome is determined. You can use
this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence
modifi er (minimum of once). You regain all expended
uses after fi nishing a long rest.
Mental Discipline and Fortitude
At 6th level, your mental defenses against the constant
incursions of the otherworld are signifi cant. Whenever
you fail a Wisdom saving throw or a Charisma saving
throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
At 6th level, you can use this ability once per long
rest. This increases to twice per long rest at 10th level,
and three times per long rest at 14th level.
Secrets of the Void
At 10th level, you have seen the physics-defying
environments of the other side, and understand that
nothing is fi xed, even when it’s rigid. When you cast a
spell that has a range greater than self or touch, or an
area of effect greater than a single target, you can alter
the range or area of effect of that spell by 50%, either
greater or smaller. After using this ability, you cannot
use it again until after completing a long rest.
Screaming into the Void
Beginning at 14th level, aware of your infi nitesimally
inconsequential nature against the vast, unfathomable
beings of the void, you have become inured to the
horrors of the mundane. You gain resistance to psychic
damage and are immune to the stunned condition.

# Voidmancy Spells
Echoes of the Void
5th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pickled octopus tentacle)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You conjure the merest shadow of the void in a 60-
foot radius centered on a point within range. This
frigid, inky blackness torments those within. The area
is considered diffi cult terrain and is utterly black, and
creatures within the area of darkness have the blinded
condition unless they have senses beyond sight. Any
creature in the area of effect must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage. At the start
of each of its turns, any creature in the area of darkness
takes 2d6 cold damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 6th level or higher, the psychic damage increases
by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
Visions of the Void
3rd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pickled eyeball)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a 30 foot radius of swirling, disorienting
visions from the void. All creatures within the area
of effect when the spell is cast, or who start their turn
there, must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or
have their speed reduced to zero. Creatures perceive
they are moving if they attempt to, but seem to fi nd no
end to the confusing visions.
Voidsight
2nd-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (an eye from an aberration)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Casting this spell, your eyes change to solid purple
orbs, able to perceive in a new, alien perspective. You
are able to see in darkness, including magical darkness,
to the limit of your normal vision. Additionally, you
have advantage on skill checks that rely on sight when
interacting with aberrations.
Voidwhisper
Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You assault the senses of a creature within range with
whispers from the void. The creature must succeed on
a Wisdom saving throw or suffer 1d6 psychic damage
and can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.
This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach
5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
