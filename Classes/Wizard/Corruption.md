# Arcane Tradition: Corruption
Some wizards, driven by a particularly strong thirst for power, open portals to the most unholy, perverse, gruesome, and chaotic plane of existence: the Abyss. This chaotic power allows those who folow the Corruption Magic tradition to learn how to bend the darkest energies to their will. This magic is the most experimental and dangerous of all, and these mages are fearless pioneers of this new branch. Though, with great power comes great... side efects.

Every time a corrupt magician summons and experiments over the forces of chaos, the stain of the Abyss spreads around like a plague. Those who dwell with the Abyss on a daily basis are afected by this corruption, and there's no way to stop it -- only to slow it down. Such taint is the price of experimenting with the most powerful radiation in existence, and for overcoming the limits of the Material Plane.

Because of the corrupting energies of the Abyss -- and their poor reputation among the other schools - corrupted magicians usualy travel alone or with other corrupted magicians, founding an [actual, experimental school](../../Organizations/MageSchools/RedOrb.md).
