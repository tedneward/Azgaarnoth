# Arcane Tradition: School of Divinity

Many individuals are intrigued by the divine, though few end up becoming members of a temple's clergy. For those who are more interested in the academic side of the divine, who have grievances with organized religious institutions, or who lacked the spirituality or piety to become a priest, the School of Divinity serves as a different way of engaging with the gods and enacting your faith.

Wizards of this school spend as much time studying religious manuscripts and holy texts as they do studying the arcane. However, they rarely get along with priests. They often view religious institutions with suspicion or disdain born out of past experience, and most priests regard the faith of these wizards as being without spiritual substance, and thus meaningless.
