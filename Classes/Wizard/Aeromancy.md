# Arcane Tradition: Aeromancy
Aeromancers are masters of the wind. They learn to
manipulate and harness the wind, sky, clouds, the
weather and more. Aeromancers know that wind
powers so much of the natural world, from weather
to erosion, and the power that can be harnessed from
the pure element of air is a formidable ally to add to
any wizard’s arsenal. With the control of air, a wizard
can push and devastate their foes, or breathe life back
into their allies when they need it the most. The sheer
strength of will that aeromancers possess is not to be
taken lightly.

Adept of the Wind
Starting at 2nd level, you learn to manipulate the air
around your body with every movement you make.
You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill if you don’t
already have it. You seem to always have an airy breeze
about you, and your movement speed increases by 5
feet.
In addition, the wind walk and wind wall spells are added
to the wizard spell list for you.
Wind Lift
At 6th level, you add levitate to your spellbook, if you
don’t already have it. Whenever you cast levitate, you
can choose one additional target. Both targets must be
within 10 feet of each other. A gentle draft of wind aids
you in levitating both targets. Additionally, if you are
not a target of your levitate spell, you have advantage
on Constitution saving throws made to maintain
concentration on the spell.
Breeze Walk
Beginning at 10th level, you can call upon the wind to
help aid you in your travels. Whenever you use windbased
magic (such as the wind wall spell) the winds
come to your aid. For 1 minute after casting a windbased
spell of 1st-level or higher, your movement speed
increases by 10 feet. Your movement is unaffected by
difficult terrain. Additionally, you do not take falling
damage, and you can not be knocked prone.
Wings of Air
At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of
wings that look as if they are made of swirling clouds
and feathers. As a bonus action, you can cause the
wings to sprout from your back, giving you a flying
speed of 40 feet. The wings last for 1 hour or until you
use your bonus action to dismiss them.
You can use this feature twice, regaining expended
uses of this ability after completing a long rest.

# Aeromancy Spells
Air Lift
4th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a feather)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You gather up the winds around you to lift and bolster
you and your allies; each creature becoming as light and
as nimble as the air itself. Choose up to four creatures
you can see within range. The targeted creatures gain
the following benefits:
• Each creature has advantage on Dexterity saving
throws
• Each creature gains a flying speed of 20 feet (though
they cannot rise more than 10 feet from the ground
or the spell ends for them).
Breath of Life
3rd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
A creature that you touch regains 3d8 hit points as you
evoke a magical wind to fill their lungs with the breath
of life. If the creature was prone or unconscious, they
are lifted back to their feet by breath of life.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8
for each slot level above 3rd.
Ensnaring Draft
6th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
At your command, a violent draft of wind swirls around
a target that you can see within range. The target must
make a successful Strength saving throw or be lifted 10
feet into the air and become restrained. While a creature
remains restrained and lifted by the draft, you can use a
bonus action on each of your subsequent turns, to move
the target up to 15 feet in any direction except vertically.
The target always remains 10 feet off the ground. The
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Remove Oxygen
5th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a miniature bellows)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a creature that you can see within range.
You magically thin the air around the creature while
it remains within range, causing the target creature
to experience dizziness and reduced coordination.
While under this effect, the target has disadvantage
on all attack rolls and ability checks. The spell ends
if the affected creature moves outside of the spell’s
range. This spell does not affect undead, constructs, or
creatures that don’t need to breathe.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell’s duration
increases by 1 minute for each slot level above 5th.
