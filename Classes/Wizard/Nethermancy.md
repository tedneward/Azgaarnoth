# Arcane Tradition: Nethermancy
You focus your studies on shadow magic, also
known as nethermancy, a method for extricating the
magical substance of primordial shadow from various
environments, then blending it with arcane forces to
augment magical effects. By such means, the spells of
a shadow mage can excite or dull the senses, punch
holes through reality to allow swift passage, and spin
creatures from the raw substance of night. Common folk
are often quick to distrust a nethermancer, but shadow
magic’s apologists defend their art by pointing out that
with spells, just like any other tool, the evil is in their
misapplication, not in the magic itself.
In the Realms of Faerûn, it is said that wizards of the
lost empire of Netheril were the first to codify these
arts, as part of their explorations of the Shadowfell.
They delved into the secrets of that gloomy realm and
discovered the malign influences there, eventually
identifying shadow magic as an impetus behind the
plane’s very existence. Some believe the very name
“nethermancy” derives from Netheril and its wizards.
Researchers of shadow magic built sanctums in the
Shadowfell at the height of their empire’s power,
believing the dark energies they harnessed to be the
leftover byproduct of primordial creation. Later, the
culture and lore of Netheril would be preserved in such
places of refuge, after the empire’s cataclysmic demise.

Umbral Insights
Beginning at 2nd level when you choose this arcane
tradition, you understand the darkness as few mortal
beings can. You can see normally in darkness, both
magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.
Additionally, the gold and time you must spend to copy
a spell into your spellbook is halved if the copied spell
does one or more of the following things:
· Creates magical darkness
· Deals necrotic damage
· Teleports you
· Conjures or summons creatures
Casting Shadows
Starting at 2nd level, nearby shadows assist you in
concealing your spellcasting and scaring your enemies.
While you are in dim light or darkness, you have
advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks, and
spells of 5th level or lower that you cast using a wizard
spell slot do not require verbal components.
Step into darkness
At 6th level, you add the darkness and misty step
spells to your spellbook. While you are in dim light or
darkness, if you cast misty step to teleport into an area
of dim light or darkness, you can take the Hide action
as part of the same bonus action, and you immediately
regain the spell slot you used to cast the spell. Once you
use this feature three times, you must finish a short or
long rest before you can use it again.
Unraveling Shadows
Beginning at 10th level, you can sense, and sometimes
direct, a silent and malevolent awareness in the magical
currents of shadow magic: a presence that seeks out
weakness. When you cast a spell that inflicts necrotic
or psychic damage during your turn, you can choose
one target of that spell. If the target is vulnerable to any
damage types, it also becomes vulnerable to necrotic
and psychic damage until the end of the turn. If the
target has no vulnerabilities, you add your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of 1) to the damage the spell deals
to that creature.
Conjured Gloom
Starting at 14th level, you can invest shadow magic into
creatures you conjure. When you use a conjuration spell
to summon or create one or more creatures, you can
choose to grant each of those creatures 15 temporary
hit points, and advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks
for the spell’s duration. A creature with sight that gains
these benefits also gains darkvision out to a range of 60
feet. If such a creature already has darkvision, its range
increases by 60 feet. Creatures you augment in this way
also have sunlight sensitivity, giving them disadvantage
on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely
on sight whilst in direct sunlight.
Additionally, when you cast a conjuration spell that
summons or creates one or more creatures, you can
choose for the space in which each creature first appears
to become heavily obscured by magical darkness until
the end of your next turn.

# Nethermantic Spells
Blade of Flickering Shadows
4th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You temporarily become a creature of shadow,
fl ickering in and out of a demiplane on the borders
of the Shadowfell, as your weapon ripples with dark
magic. Until the spell ends, you have resistance to
necrotic damage, and your melee weapon attacks infl ict
an additional 3d4 necrotic damage on a hit.
Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the
duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you
vanish from your current plane of existence and appear
in a shadowy refl ection of it, which lies somewhere on
the planar boundary between your current location
and the Shadowfell (the spell fails and the casting is
wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start
of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are
in the shadowy refl ection of your current plane, you
return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you
can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from.
If no unoccupied space is available within that range,
you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at
random if more than one space is equally near). You can
dismiss this spell as an action.
While in the shadowy refl ection, you can see and hear
the plane you originated from, but everything is lightly
obscured, and you can't see anything more than 30 feet
away. You are not truly in the Shadowfell, nor in your
previous location during that time, but somewhere
in between the planes. Whenever you are in the
shadowy refl ection, you can only affect, or be affected
by, creatures with resistance or immunity to necrotic
damage.
Inevitable Winter
6th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (the mummifi ed fi nger of a
humanoid who froze to death)
Duration: Instantaneous
You call spirits of death and winter, commanding them
to surround a foe to sap its vitality. Choose one creature
you can see within range. The creature takes 2d12+20
cold damage, and it must make a Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage
equal to the amount of cold damage it took from this
spell, and the next time it makes a saving throw before
the end of its next turn, the target must roll a d6 and
subtract the number rolled from the saving throw.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the cold damage
increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 6th.
Shadow Magic
5th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: S
Duration: Instantaneous
You cast an illusory version of one of the following
spells: fi reball, cone of cold, or lightning bolt. Treat
this as if the spell had been cast but with the following
exceptions:
• Targets make a Charisma saving throw instead of
the normal saving throw for the imitated spell.
• Instead of the normal damage for the imitated spell,
a creatures that fails its Charisma saving throw take
4d6 necrotic damage and 4d6 psychic damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one.
• A creature reduced to zero hit points by this spell
is not killed, but is stable and unconscious at zero
hit points. A creature that falls unconscious due to
damage from this spell can make a Wisdom saving
throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it
regains hit points equal to the psychic damage this
spell infl icted.
One minute after a creature takes psychic damage
from this spell, it regains a number of hit points equal to
the psychic damage taken, unless it already recovered
those hit points by making a successful Wisdom saving
throw against this spell, as described above.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 6th-level or higher, the psychic damage and
necrotic damage both increase by 1d6 for every two slot
levels above 5th.
Shifting Shadow
Conjuration cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: S
Duration: Instantaneous
Too quick for mortal eyes to perceive, you move no
further than the reach of your shadow. You can move
up to 5 feet, and this movement does not provoke
opportunity attacks.
