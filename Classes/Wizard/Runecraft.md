# Arcane Tradition: Runecraft
You have unlocked the secrets of the runic magic:
ancient symbols of immense power the giants once
used to forge and control a vast empire. Each symbol
represents a fundamental concept, and when carved
with the right tools and ingredients, it courses with
arcane energy. Runecrafters practice and hone their
craft, while working closely with dwarven or giant
smiths and masons.

The Basics of Runecraft
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level,
your practice at inscribing runes and tattoos has made
you profi cient with mason’s tools and calligrapher’s
supplies.
Runic Tattoos
Beginning at 2nd Level, you can inscribe yourself with
magical tattoos made of the runic language of giants.
You can choose three runes to inscribe on your body
from the list on the next page. Once chosen, they cannot
be changed until you reach the following levels 6th,
10th, and 14th respectively.
Each rune has a permanent bonus and a temporary
ability. A runic tattoo can be ‘activated’ as a reaction,
and its power lasts for 1 minute. You can use this ability
a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifi er
(minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of this
ability when you fi nish a long rest
Runic Inscription
Beginning at 6th level, you gain an additional rune and
can exchange a single known rune for another.
You can spend 10 minutes inscribing a physical
location with one of the runes you know. Once
completed, you can use an action to activate the rune,
granting its benefi t or resistance to every creature
within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the rune. The
benefi t persists as long as the creatures remain within
the sphere. The rune’s power lasts for 1 hour.
You regain use of this ability when you fi nish a long
rest.
Runic Mastery
Beginning at 10th level, you learn an additional rune
and can exchange a single known rune for another.
You also gain an additional activation of your runes. In
addition, when you activate a rune, you can share its
effects with a creature within 30 feet of you.
While the rune is active and if the rune has a damage
type listed, when you damage a creature with a spell or
attack, you can use another activation of the rune (if you
have any) to add additional damage of that type equal
to your wizard level. If the spell deals damage to more
than one creature, you choose which creature receives
the additional damage. The rune’s effect only empowers
a single spell or attack.
Runic Absorption
Starting at 14th level, you learn an additional rune and
can exchange a single known rune for another.
You also gain the Absorption Rune, a special rune
that has no passive or active abilities, tattooed on your
chest or back (your choice). Instead, you can use your
reaction and expend an activation of your runes to
absorb a spell that is targeting only you (excluding area
of effect spells). The spell’s level must be equal to or
less than one third of your wizard level rounded down.
The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's
energy, not the spell itself, is stored in your rune. The
energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast.
If you are targeted by a spell that you can't store, this
ability has no effect on that spell.
You always know how many levels of spell energy
your rune currently has stored. You can, as an action,
convert energy stored in your Absorption Rune into
spell slots to cast spells. You can create spell slots only
of a level equal to or lower than the spell level you can
normally cast, up to a maximum of 6th level. It costs 1
level of stored spell energy for every level of the spell
slot created. The energy is stored until used, or until
you fi nish a long rest.

# Runecrafter Spells
Spell Rune
5th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (calligrapher’s supplies and 50 gp
worth of gem dust per level of the bound spell, which
the rune consumes)
Duration: Until triggered or dispelled
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that
harms or helps other creatures, either upon a surface
(such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or on an
object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or
a treasure chest). The glyph can cover an area of the
surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. Unlike a
glyph of warding, the object can be moved.
The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell
save DC to be found.
You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast
the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most
typical triggers include touching or standing on the
glyph, removing another object covering the glyph,
approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or
manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed.
For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common
triggers include opening that object, approaching
within a certain distance of the object, seeing or reading
the glyph, or saying the command word. Once a glyph
is triggered, this spell ends.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates
only under certain circumstances or according to
physical characteristics (such as height or weight),
creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to
affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also
set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph,
such as those who say a certain password.
You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower
in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph.
The spell must target a single creature or an area. The
spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in
this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell
is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature
that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the
area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons
hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they
appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it.
If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end
of its full duration.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the spell you are able
to store increases by one spell level for each two slots
above 5th.
Rune of Suppression
6th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (A corked vial engraved with
runes)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You reroute the weave to stifl e magical enchantments.
You speak words of power, causing a burning rune
to appear on an item or creature that you can see
within range, suppressing its innate magical abilities.
An unwilling creature, a sentient object, or a creature
wearing or carrying an item, must make a Charisma
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature or object has
its magical abilities suppressed as if under the effects of
an antimagic fi eld spell.
Spellcasters under this effect have disadvantage on
Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration,
as well as on all ability checks. The target can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success.
Rune of Recharge
4th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (A glass funnel engraved with
runes)
Duration: Instantaneous
You can use the power of your magic to recharge
items or magical abilities. You can touch a magic item
or creature and expend a spell slot of up to 4th level.
If you touched a magic item and it holds charges, the
item regains charges equal to the level of the spell
slot expended. If you touched a creature, the creature
regains the a use of an innate spellcasting ability of
level equal to or less then the spell slot expended (i.e.
regaining a use of a drow’s darkness ability requires a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher).
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can expend a slot
of equal level to recharge charges or innate spellcasting
abilities. For example, casting with a 6th level slot
allows you to expend up to another 6th level slot, for 6
charges or regaining an innate spell ability of up to 6th
level.
Runic Barrier
5th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a quill and inkwell)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You weave the words of a spell into a barrier of glowing
runes, creating a barrier of swirling runes on a solid
surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60
feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall
up to 20 feet in diameter, 10 feet high, and 1foot thick.
The wall is opaque, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius,
and lasts for the duration.
When you cast this spell, you must also expend a spell
slot for a spell between levels 1 and 3 with a duration
of instantaneous. This spell becomes locked in the
barrier. Any creature crossing the barrier is affected
by the spell as if they were the target of that spell. The
wall can affect a number of creatures equal to 1 + your
spellcasting ability modifi er (minimum 1).
When the wall appears, each creature within its area
must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature can
choose to fail this save. On a failed save, the creature is
immediately affected by the spell that is locked in the
wall.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level, the highest level of the spell
slot that you can expend using this spell increases to
4th level; when you cast this spell slot of 9th level, the
highest level of the spell slot that you can expend using
this spell increases to 5th level.
