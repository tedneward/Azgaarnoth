# Arcane Tradition: Ancient Magic
You have stumbled upon some source of ancient magic (often--but not always--Eldar magic), whether it be spellcasting notes, an old magical item, magic runes, or something else which you are only starting to unravel the secrets of. The only thing that you know for certain is that this source of magic will enhance your spellcasting in some way.

Practitioners of this tradition are almost never part of a [Mage School](../../Organizations/MageSchools/index.md) and will often refuse to share their hard-won secrets with others.

## Arcane Protection
Starting at 2nd level, you have learned how to invoke an old protection magic to help protect someone. As a bonus action, you may touch a creature, giving it a bonus to all saving throws equal to half your proficiency bonus rounded down for 8 hours. Once you use this feature, you can not use it again until after you finish a long rest.

## Studied
Starting at 2nd level, you have begun to study up on ancient uses of arcane magic. You may gain advantage on a Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (History) check related to magic before the results of the roll have been announced. Once you use this feature, you can not use it again until after you finish a long rest.

## Enhanced Spellcasting
Starting at 6th level, you have begun to incorporate ancient magic into your spellcasting. When you cast a cantrip or spell that deals damage and roll a 1 on a damage roll, you may reroll the die. You must then use the new roll.

## Aura of Magic
Starting at 10th level, your study of ancient magic has irreversibly altered you. You now emit a 10 foot magical aura. This aura dispels all illusions that come into contact with the aura, and you can sense whenever a creature enters or exits your aura, but not where they are in your aura.

## Ancient Curse
By 14th level, you have mastered the art of ancient magic, and are able to place a "glyph" on a creature's very soul. As an action, you may place this "glyph" on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. For 1 minute, they have disadvantage on saving throws caused by spells you cast, they take 1d10 psychic damage at the start of their turn, and you have advantage on any saving throws caused by the target. Once you use this feature, you can not use it again until you finish a long rest.
