# Arcane Tradition: Fleuremancy
The fleuremancer delves deep into the mysteries of something that most creatures take for granted â€“ light. With the dawn of each day, the fleuremancer begins their research anew. While for others this is a call to mundane activity, to the fleuremancer it is an opportunity to delve into the dichotomy that splits the existence of surface dwelling creatures. Beyond mere light and dark, the fleuremancer understands the subtleties of radiance, the spectrum of light, and the destructive nature of illumination.

## Bonus Proficiencies
Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Investigation and Perception skills if you don't already have it.

## Bonus Cantrips
Starting at 2nd level, you learn the [light]() and [dancing lights]() cantrips and they don't count against your number of cantrips known.

## Dazzling Display
Starting at 2nd level, when you cast a spell with a visible effect, you can add a dazzling display of lights to it. A creature of your choice that is either the target of the spell, or in the area of effect of the spell, must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell DC or be blinded until the end of their next turn. Creatures with sunlight sensitivity make this saving throw at disadvantage. You regain the use of this ability after finishing a short or long rest.

## Displacement
Beginning at 6th level, as a reaction to being attacked, you are able to bend light around yourself, appearing to be two feet from your actual position. Any attacks against you, including the triggering attack, that rely on visual targeting, are made with disadvantage. Once activated, this ability lasts until the end of your next tum. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and regain all expended uses after completing a long rest. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.

## Prismatic Shield
At 10th level, as a reaction to being targeted by a spell that requires a saving throw, you can conjure an invisible shield that intercepts and breaks down the arcane magic into light and energy. You have advantage on your saving throw, and if your saving throw is successful against the spell, it has no effect at all on you, and you regain one expended use of your displacement ability.

If the target spell affects multiple creatures, the shield only protects you. After using this ability, you cannot use it again until after completing a long rest.

## Intensity
Starting at 14th level, you can impose disadvantage on saving throws made by creatures attempting to resist a spell that you cast that uses light or color. This includes any spell on the Fleuremancer Spell List, or any other spells the DM deems as falling into this category. After using this ability, you cannot use it again until after completing a long rest.
