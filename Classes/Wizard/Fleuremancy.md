# Arcane Tradition: Fleuremancy
The fleuremancer delves deep into the mysteries
of something that most creatures take for granted –
light. With the dawn of each day, the fleuremancer
begins their research anew. While for others this is a
call to mundane activity, to the fleuremancer it is an
opportunity to delve into the dichotomy that splits
the existence of surface dwelling creatures of Faerun.
Beyond mere light and dark, the fleuremancer
understands the subtleties of radiance, the spectrum of
light, and the destructive nature of illumination.

Bonus Proficiencies
Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the
Investigation and Perception skills if you don’t already
have it.
Bonus Cantrips
Starting at 2nd level, you learn the light and dancing
lights cantrips and they don’t count against your
number of cantrips known.
Dazzling Display
Starting at 2nd level, when you cast a spell with a
visible effect, you can add a dazzling display of lights
to it. A creature of your choice that is either the target of
the spell, or in the area of effect of the spell, must make
a successful Constitution saving throw against your
spell DC or be blinded until the end of their next turn.
Creatures with sunlight sensitivity make this saving
throw at disadvantage. You regain the use of this ability
after finishing a short or long rest.
Displacement
Beginning at 6th level, as a reaction to being attacked,
you are able to bend light around yourself, appearing
to be two feet from your actual position. Any attacks
against you, including the triggering attack, that rely
on visual targeting, are made with disadvantage. Once
activated, this ability lasts until the end of your next
tum. You can use this ability a number of times equal
to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and
regain all expended uses after completing a long rest.
An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on
sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as
with truesight.
Prismatic Shield
At 10th level, as a reaction to being targeted by a
spell that requires a saving throw, you can conjure an
invisible shield that intercepts and breaks down the
arcane magic into light and energy. You have advantage
on your saving throw, and if your saving throw is
successful against the spell, it has no effect at all on you,
and you regain one expended use of your displacement
ability.
If the target spell affects multiple creatures, the shield
only protects you. After using this ability, you cannot
use it again until after completing a long rest.
Intensity
Starting at 14th level, you can impose disadvantage on
saving throws made by creatures attempting to resist a
spell that you cast that uses light or color. This includes
any spell on the Fleuremancer Spell List, or any other
spells the DM deems as falling into this category. After
using this ability, you cannot use it again until after
completing a long rest.

also become sheathed in scintillating sparks until the
