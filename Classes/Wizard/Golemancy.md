# Arcane Tradition: Golemancy
You focus your studies on the construction of artificial life, the fabled [golem](/Creatures/Golem.md). These constructs have a long history associated with wizards, serving as laboratory assistants, objects of experimentation, and implacable guardians capable of enduring withering eons--and sometimes, literally, hellish conditions. Golems represent arcane knowledge given form; imbuing material matter with magic, giving it immense strength and inexorable locomotion, while remaining fully under the wizard's control.

## The Basics of Crafting
When you choose this school at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with mason's tools, smith's tools, and woodcarver's tools, representing the three primary materials golems are crafted from, and the mending cantrip, which does not count against your maxiumum cantrips known.

## Prototype Golem
Beginning at 2nd Level, you can craft a basic, though unadvanced, construct.

The golem is magically bound to you. As long as both you and your golem are on the same plane of existence, you can telepathically summon the golem, which will then travel to you, knowing both the distance and direction to you.

The golem is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the construct, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you are incapacitated, your golem will protect you and try to carry out the last command you gave it to the best of its abilities.

Your golem gains one level (and one Hit Die) for each level you gain after 2nd. Its profi ciency bonus equals your profi ciency bonus. Whenever your class grants you the Ability Score Increase feature, your golem can increase one of its ability scores (your choice) by 2, or it can increase two of its ability scores (your choice) by 1.

The mending cantrip restores 5 hit points to the golem. If your construct is reduced to zero hit points, it collapses, unable to be restored by the cantrip. The golem can only be repaired after spending a long rest using either mason's tools, smith's tools, or woodcarver's tools, and expending a 1st level spell slot to reactivate it.

## Advanced Programming
Beginning at 6th level, your golem adds its profi ciency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. Your golem gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes profi cient in Strength and Constitution saving throws.

## Adaptable Build
Beginning at 10th level, your golem gains one of the following abilities, which can be changed at the end of a long rest:
* Hostility Confrontation Matrix. The golem gains an additional slam attack, and its slam attacks deal 2d6 bludgeoning damage. If it hits a Large or smaller creature, the creature must make a successful Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, or be knocked prone. In addition, your golem deals double damage to objects and structures.
* Arcane Hardened Chassis. Your golem gains immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks not made with adamantine weapons. In addition, it gains resistance to acid, cold, fire, and lightning damage.
* Prescient Defense Measures. If your golem is within 30 feet of you, you can transfer half of any damage you take (rounded up) to your golem. In addition, when a creature makes an attack against you, the golem can use its reaction to grant you a bonus to your AC against that attack equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

## Spell-Powered Golem
Starting at 14th level, you can store one spell of 4th level or lower in your golem. To do so, you cast that spell, storing it within the golem and expending the spell slot, but the spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when you command the golem to use its action to cast the stored spell, or when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you store the spell in the golem. When the spell is cast, or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.

Whenever the golem has a spell stored within it, at the start of each of its turns, and as long as it has at least 1 hit point, the golem regains 5 hit points. Additionally, it gains the magic resistance trait, and its slam attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage immunities and resistances.
