# Arcane Tradition: Golemancy
You focus your studies on the construction of artifi cial
life, the fabled golem. These constructs have a long
history associated with wizards, serving as laboratory
assistants, objects of experimentation, and implacable
guardians capable of enduring withering eons—and
sometimes, literally, hellish conditions.
Golems represent arcane knowledge given form;
imbuing material matter with magic, giving it immense
strength and inexorable locomotion, while remaining
fully under the wizard’s control.

The Basics of Crafting
When you choose this school at 2nd level, you gain
profi ciency with mason’s tools, smith’s tools, and
woodcarver's tools, representing the three primary
materials golems are crafted from, and the mending
cantrip, which does not count against your maxiumum
cantrips known.
Prototype Golem
Beginning at 2nd Level, you can craft a basic, though
unadvanced, construct.
The golem is magically bound to you. As long as
both you and your golem are on the same plane of
existence, you can telepathically summon the golem,
which will then travel to you, knowing both the
distance and direction to you.
The golem is friendly to you and your companions.
Roll initiative for the construct, which has its own
turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to
it (no action required by you). If you are incapacitated,
your golem will protect you and try to carry out the
last command you gave it to the best of its abilities.
Your golem gains one level (and one Hit Die) for
each level you gain after 2nd. Its profi ciency bonus
equals your profi ciency bonus. Whenever your class
grants you the Ability Score Increase feature, your
golem can increase one of its ability scores (your
choice) by 2, or it can increase two of its ability scores
(your choice) by 1.
The mending cantrip restores 5 hit points to the
golem. If your construct is reduced to zero hit points,
it collapses, unable to be restored by the cantrip. The
golem can only be repaired after spending a
long rest using either mason’s tools, smith’s tools, or
woodcarver's tools, and expending a 1st level spell slot
to reactivate it.
Advanced Programming
Beginning at 6th level, your golem adds its profi ciency
bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls. Your golem
gains profi ciency in two skills of your choice. It also
becomes profi cient in Strength and Constitution saving
throws.
Adaptable Build
Beginning at 10th level, your golem gains one of the
following abilities, which can be changed at the end of
a long rest:
• Hostility Confrontation Matrix. The golem gains
an additional slam attack, and its slam attacks
deal 2d6 bludgeoning damage. If it hits a Large
or smaller creature, the creature must make a
successful Strength saving throw against your
spell save DC, or be knocked prone. In addition,
your golem deals double damage to objects and
structures.
• Arcane Hardened Chassis. Your golem gains
immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
from nonmagical attacks not made with adamantine
weapons. In addition, it gains resistance to acid,
cold, fi re, and lightning damage.
• Prescient Defense Measures. If your golem is
within 30 feet of you, you can transfer half of any
damage you take (rounded up) to your golem. In
addition, when a creature makes an attack against
you, the golem can use its reaction to grant you a
bonus to your AC against that attack equal to your
Intelligence modifi er (minimum of 1).
Spell-Powered Golem
Starting at 14th level, you can store one spell of 4th level
or lower in your golem. To do so, you cast that spell,
storing it within the golem and expending the spell slot,
but the spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes
effect when you command the golem to use its action
to cast the stored spell, or when a certain circumstance
occurs. You describe that circumstance when you store
the spell in the golem. When the spell is cast, or a new
spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.
Whenever the golem has a spell stored within it, at the
start of each of its turns, and as long as it has at least 1
hit point, the golem regains 5 hit points. Additionally, it
gains the magic resistance trait, and its slam attacks count
as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage
immunities and resistances.
