# Arcane Tradition: Kinetics
Among the most intune with how the Weave can
enhance movement, the kineticist focuses on the
Weave to manipulate space, and movement within it.
Telekinesis, teleportation, and enhanced movement
are all among this wizard’s storehouse, and they are
valuable assets in any army or adventuring party,
helping to ensure movement over great distances in a
short period of time.

Spell-Powered Avoidance
At 2nd level, your movement speed increases by 5 feet.
When you cast a spell, you can use your reaction to
move 5 feet without provoking an opportunity attack.
Stronghsnd Magic
Beginning at 2nd level, you know the mage hand cantrip
and it doesn’t count against the number of cantrips you
know. The range of your mage hand increases to 60 feet,
and it can carry up to 20 pounds.
Evasive Maneuver
At 6th level, you are more connected with the Weave,
sensing which pathways are most easily traversed. As a
reaction, when you are targeted by a spell attack or area
of effect spell, you can use your reaction to cast misty
step. If you were targeted by a melee attack or touch
spell, the attack misses. If you were targeted by a ranged
attack, the attacker has disadvantage, or they can choose
a different target. You regain the use of this ability after
finishing a short rest.
Transportive Assault
Starting at 10th level, when you cast misty step, you can
bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who
is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature
must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.
When you cast misty step, dimension door, or any other
spell that transports you across a distance, and you end
in a space that is within five feet of any enemy, you or
the creature you transported can use a reaction to make
a single attack with a weapon you are holding, against
the adjacent creature.
Innate Transportation
At 14th level, your mage hand can wield a single light
melee weapon. As a bonus action, you can move the
hand up to 30 feet to a location within range, or order
it to attack. It is proficient with the same weapons that
you have proficiency with and it has the same attack
and damage bonuses that you have. When you use
misty step, dimension door, or similar spells, your mage
hand is transported with you and appears in your space.
Finally, you can cast misty step twice without using a
spell slot, and dimension door once without expending a
spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells
in this way when you finish a long rest.

An unwilling creature must succeed on a Wisdom

the target is an object, you must succeed on a DC 20
Intelligence (Arcana) check to successfully summon the

discretion).
If for any reason, the spell fails, you take 6d10 psychic
damage.
