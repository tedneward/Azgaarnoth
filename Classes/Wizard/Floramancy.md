# Arcane Tradition: Floramancy
Floramancy wizards are sometimes confused with or
mistaken for druids. They tend their gardens, protect
their woods, or study in cabins buried deep in the lush
jungles of the world, living in harmony with the plants,
animals, and nature that they revere. Their abodes
are often decorated with the preserved green-things
of the world, delicately displayed for visitors to truly
see the beauty of nature. Floramancy wizards dedicate
themselves to magic that evokes the strength, beauty,
and fortitude of the natural world.

Nature Savant
At 2nd level, you gain profi ciency in the Nature skill.
Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence
(Nature) checks to identify plants such as trees, fl owers,
and herbs.
Nature Magic
Starting at 2nd level, you have a knowledge of nature
and magic that is unparalleled. The following naturebased
magic spells are added to the Wizard spell list for
you;
barkskin, commune with nature, detect poison and disease,
druidcraft, grasping vine, locate animals or plants, plant
growth, protection from poison, speak with plants, spike
growth, thornwhip, transport via plants, tree stride, and wall
of thorns
Plant Camoflage
Beginning at 6th level, you can magically adapt your
body to appear more plant-like. As an action, your body
becomes covered in leaves, vines, petals, or twigs. This
transformation lasts for 10 minutes. While transformed
in this way, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks made to hide in any natural terrain brimming
with plantlife. You can use this ability a number of
times per day equal to your Intelligence modifi er
(minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of this
ability when you fi nish a long rest.
Thorns
At 10th level, whenever you use your Plant Camoufl age
ability, you can choose to add thorns to your
transformation. If you do, whenever you are targeted by
a melee attack, the attacker takes 2d6 piercing damage
from the thorns covering your body. The damage counts
as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance
and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage. At
14th level, the thorn damage increases to 4d6.
Photosynthesis
At 14th level, whenever you use your Plant Camoufl age
ability, you are renewed while you are in sunlight.
If you spend a total of 10 minutes or more in direct
sunlight while transformed, you do not require food
or drink for that day. If you are reduced to zero hit
points whilst you are transformed in this way, you
automatically stabilize if you are in direct sunlight.
Additionally, for a single transformation, you regain
1d4 hit points for each minute spent in direct sunlight.
If this ability hasn’t been used, and you are reduced
to zero hit points while transformed in sunlight, it
automatically activates. After you have used the
regeneration part of this ability, you cannot use it again
until after you have completed a long rest.

# Floromancy Spells
Conjure Plants
3rd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You summon plant creatures that appear in unoccupied
spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of
the following options for what appears; four awakened
shrubs or one awakened tree.
Each plant creature disappears when it drops to zero
hit points, or when the spell ends.
The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your
companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures
as a group, which have their own turns. They obey any
verbal commands that you issue to them (no action
required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to
them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures,
but otherwise take no actions.
The DM has the creatures’ statistics.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the
summoning options above, and more creatures appear:
twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as
many with a 8th level slot.
Preserve Plant
evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a decaying plant)
Duration: Instantaneous
You touch a decaying, rotting, diseased, or otherwise
injured plant. The plant, including all of its extremities,
roots, and other parts, can be no bigger in total, than a
20-foot cube. The plant is restored to life as if all of its
nutrient, moisture, and sunlight requirements are being
met. It is purged of any diseases or insects that may
have caused its decay. This spell does not affect plant
creatures.
Sunglow
5th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You shed bright light from your body in a 120-foot
radius. This light counts as sunlight for the purposes of
your photosynthesis feature. Any creature within 30 feet
of you has disadvantage on attacks made against you.
Any creature starting its turn within 10 feet of you must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become blinded.
The blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. The blinded condition automatically ends if the
blinded creature leaves the spell’s area of effect.
Whimsybloom
Illusion cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a fl ower petal)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a point of bare earth within range that you
can see. An illusory fl ower grows from the earth
and blossoms at the point that you choose. The
Whimsybloom can resemble a real fl ower species, but it
does not have to. It can be any color that you want it to
be, including colors that don’t commonly or naturally
occur in fl owers. As part of the illusion, you can choose
one of the following effects to add to the illusory fl ower:
• The Whimsybloom hums a melodious tune at a
pleasant volume
• The Whimsybloom has a faint glow around it, in
any color that you choose
• The Whimsybloom emits a pleasant odor in all
directions in a 5-foot radius around it
• The Whimsybloom seems to dance, sway, or move
in a slow manner for the duration of the spell
If a creature uses its action to examine the
Whimsybloom, the creature can determine that it is an
illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation)
check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns
the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to
the creature.
