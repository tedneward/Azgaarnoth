# Arcane Tradition: Neo-Bloodmancer
*"My blood courses with arcane power while your blood, when I begin, will simply spill from your body."*

Blood mages learn to heighten their spellcraft by uniting the power of blood and arcane might. Blood is life, though wizards that travel this path of magic view the sanguine fluid flowing through their veins as a wellspring of arcane power.

Blood mages often forgo tradition, seeing it as a hindrance toward obtaining knowledge rather than a foundation. Since very few understand their motives and lack of regard for proven arcane conventions, many believe they are free spirits, simply acting in an entirely intuitive manner and with little to no thought. This is a misperception. Blood mages may not confine themselves to the laborious task of scribing spells, but will instead focus that energy into a structured dance and exercise. This deliberate movement of the body increases the flow of blood and intertwines its power with the Weave.

## A Tale of Two Traditions
For a time, in the ancient days, the art of using the blood as power was threatened with extinction. Vigorous prosecution by various arcane and divine organizations had reduced those who practiced its skills down to a mere handful. As a result, instruction suffered; students were forced to improvise and learn on their own, rather than build upon what those before them had studied.

Over time, the traditions of the [Bloodmancer](./Bloodmancer.md) varied and broke away from the ancient ways, and although the ancient ways eventually reasserted themselves centuries later, by that time a new tradition had already been born, colloquially called the "neobloodmancer". The two groups generally steer clear of each other, preferring to study the power of blood in their own way.

## Blood Savant
You combine the source of your arcane power with the blood flowing through your veins. When you select this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in Medicine and double your proficiency bonus to any check made with the skill, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

Furthermore, when you perform the Arcane Recovery feature, you also regain 1 expended hit die.

## Blood Magic
Starting at 2nd level, you can form a bond between your lifeblood and the magical energies of the Weave. As an action, you call upon the power of blood by inflicting a ritualistic wound upon yourself.

While the wound does not deal damage or break concentration, it is a hemophilic wound and therefore remains open. Once you staunch the flow of blood, you weaken the connection to the Weave.

When you inflict a hemophilic wound, you gain access to a pool of blood points (described below). Once you inflict a hemophilic wound, you cannot inflict another such wound again until you finish a long rest.

**Blood Pool.** You have a number of blood points determined by your wizard level. You can have more blood points than shown on the table for your level.

Level | Blood Points
----- | ------------
2-4   | 2
5-8   | 3
9-12  | 4
13-16 | 5
17-20 | 6

**Healing.** Any form of healing you receive staunches the flow of blood and can close the hemophilic wound. When you regain one or more hit points, you also lose 1 blood point. When you no longer have any blood points, the hemophilic wound heals.

**Blood Rites.** You learn two blood rituals of your choice, detailed below under Blood Rites.
When you gain a level in the wizard class, you can choose one of the blood rites you know and replace it with another blood rite that you can learn.

## Empowered Blood
At 6th level, when you roll damage for a spell, you can reroll a number of damage dice
up to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new result.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 14th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once in the same turn.

## Blood Awakening
Starting at 10th level, you can bestow consciousness upon the blood of a dead creature causing the lifeblood to reinvigorate the corpse.

You can cast revivify once using a wizard spell slot. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Cull the Blood
At 14th level, you can manipulate the blood of another creature and cull it free from its confinement, drawing it from the body all at once. The pressure ruptures tissues and organs causing intense pain.

As an action, one creature within 30 feet must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much on successful one. This feature has no effect on constructs, oozes, plants, and undead.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Blood Rites
**Blood Focus.** When you cast a spell that does not indicate a cost for a material component, you can spend 1 blood point to cast the spell without material components.

**Blood Ritual.** You can expend 2 blood points to cast a 1st level spell with the ritual tag from a spell list from any class. You must cast the spell as a ritual.

**Blood Spell.** You can spend blood points to cast a spell that you prepared without expending a spell slot on your turn. The Casting a Spell table shows the cost of casting a spell of a given level. You can cast a spell no higher level than 4th and must meet the minimum level required to cast the spell.

Spell Level | Blood Point Cost | Minimum Caster Level
----------- | ---------------- | --------------------
1st | 2 | 2nd
2nd | 3 | 5th
3rd | 5 | 13th
4th | 6 | 17th

**Fortitude of Blood.** You can expend 1 blood point and concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell) to gain profi- ciency in Constitution saving throws.

**Phantom Vigor.** When you cast a wizard cantrip, you can spend 1 blood point as a bonus action to gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points.

**Potent Blood.** When you cast a wizard cantrip, you can expend 1 blood point to add your proficiency bonus to the damage.

**Silence the Pain.** You can expend 1 blood point and concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell) to gain resistance to psychic damage. While you invoke this blood rite, psychic damage does not cause you to break concentration.
