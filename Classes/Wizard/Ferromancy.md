# Arcane Tradition: Ferromancy
Ferromancers are specialists in metal and magnetism;
learning to create or manipulate metal objects, enhance
or destroy them, or use magnetic forces to attract,
repel or statically charge nearby metal. Ferromancers
favor metal weapons and armor, their unique specialty
enhanced, not hindered, by bulky raiment and arms.

Bonus Proficiencies
Starting at 2nd level you are proficient with all metal
weapons and metal armor. You also learn the heat metal
spell, adding it to your spellbook, but you cannot cast it
until you have access to 2nd level spell slots.
Magnetic Ward
Beginning at 2nd level, as a reaction you can generate
a magnetic ward around yourself that interferes with
incoming weapon attacks, deflecting and reducing their
velocity. For 1 minute, you reduce all damage that you
take from weapon attacks by an amount equal to your
Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You do not regain
hit points if the damage is reduced to below zero. You
regain the use of this ability after completing a long
rest. At 10th level, you regain the use of this ability after
finishing a short or long rest.
Static
Starting at 6th level, whenever a creature fails a saving
throw against one of your spells, they are surrounded
by a residual static charge for a number of turns equal
to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). If the
creature ends its turn within 5 feet of one or more
creatures affected by this static charge, each creature
takes 1d6 lightning damage.
Breach Armor
Starting at 10th level, your weapon and spell attacks
against creatures constructed of metal, or creatures
wearing armor that is primarily made of metal,
are made with advantage as you are able to subtly
manipulate their defenses to open weaknesses.
Magnetic Field
Starting at 14th level, as an action, you can evoke an
electrically charged magnetic field in a 20-foot-radius
around yourself that moves with you. The field lasts
for 1 minute. When a creature enters the magnetic field
for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, if it
is wearing metal armor, wielding metal weapons, or
carrying more than 30lbs of metal, the creature takes
1d6 lightning damage and treats the area as difficult
terrain. If the creature is also affected by your Static
ability, the damage increases to 2d6 lightning damage.
You can use this ability once per long rest.

# Ferromancy Spells
Chaotic Polarity Aura
2nd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a lodestone)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You select a creature within range and create a warped
magnetic field around them that randomly attracts and
repels metal objects. This creates a series of rapidly
changing forces, which interferes with their movements
and actions. The creature must succeed on a Strength
saving throw, or suffer a -2 penalty to its AC, and have
disadvantage on all of its attacks, ability checks, and
saving throws. The affected creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
Flechette
Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S, M (a metal shard)
Duration: Instantaneous
You create a single, sharp metal blade that streaks
towards a target within range. Make a ranged spell
attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes
1d8 piercing damage. This weapon counts as magical
weapon for the purposes of overcoming resistance and
immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach
5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
Flechette Spray
1st-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (15-foot cone)
Components: V, S, M (a metal shard)
Duration: Instantaneous
You create a spray of sharp metal blades that erupt from
your outstretched hands. Each creature in a 15-foot cone
must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes
3d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. The blades are considered
magical weapons for the purposes of overcoming
resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and
damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
Flechette Storm
5th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (60-foot cone)
Components: V, S, M (a metal shard)
Duration: Instantaneous
A deadly shower of razor-sharp metal blades bursts
forth from your outstretched hands. Each creature in
a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
creature takes 8d8 piercing damage on a failed saving
throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
These blades are considered magical weapons for the
purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to
nonmagical attacks and damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
Rust Field
6th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a piece of rust monster chitin)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You set up a 20-foot radius immobile sphere of crackling
russet energy centered on a point within range. All
nonmagical ferrous metal (iron, steel, or alloy) objects
within the area of effect, crumble to dust.
Any creatures wearing or carrying such objects must
make a Dexterity saving throw or have their metal
objects destroyed. If the saving throw fails by 4 or less,
the objects are weakened, losing integrity and becoming
brittle. Weakened weapons are reduced to the next
lower dice for damage rolls (a longsword deals 1d6
instead of 1d8, a dagger deals 1d3 instead of 1d4), and
armor suffers a -2 penalty to its AC. Other objects suffer
reduced function or may fail on use (i.e. iron pitons
cannot hold weight, pots leak, etc) with the exact effect
left up to the DM. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more,
the object is destroyed.
Rusting Burst
4th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (20-foot radius)
Components: V, S, M (a piece of rust monster chitin)
Duration: Instantaneous
You generate a burst of corrosive energy in an area
around you that rusts ferrous metal objects. All
nonmagical ferrous metal (iron, steel, and alloys) that is
not being worn or carried, crumbles to useless dust.
Any creatures wearing or carrying such objects must
make a Dexterity saving throw or have their metal
objects crumble to dust before their very eyes. If the
saving throw fails by 4 or less, the objects are weakened,
losing integrity and becoming brittle. Weakened
weapons are reduced to the next lower dice for damage
rolls (a longsword deals 1d6 instead of 1d8, a dagger
deals 1d3 instead of 1d4), and armor suffers a -2 penalty
to its AC. Other objects suffer reduced function or may
fail on use (i.e. iron pitons cannot hold weight, pots
leak, etc) with the exact effect left up to the DM. If the
saving throw fails by 5 or more, the object is destroyed.
Rusting Grasp
3rd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a piece of rust monster chitin)
Duration: Instantaneous
You reach out and touch a single nonmagical ferrous
metal (iron, steel, or alloy) object, causing it to instantly
corrode into flakes of rust. This spell only affects a
5-foot-cube area, leaving any portion of the object
outside that area unaffected. A creature wearing or
carrying the object can make a Dexterity saving throw to
avoid this effect.
