# Class: Rune Scribe
Runes are thought to be the "original magic", the power by which the Eldar governed the world, and thus knowledge of how to scribe and use runes is highly prized. However, runes currently in use are a fraction of the power of the runes supposedly used by the Eldar, and to many within Azgaarnoth, runes have long since ceased to be a subject of interest; either the magic of runes has fallen completely, or the fall of the Eldar took too much knowledge, or the Eldar's use of runes has proven runes to be inadequate, the rationale all depends on the point of view of the speaker.

Nevertheless, there are those who perservere, and those who use runes as a means to enhance their martial might are called rune scribes.
