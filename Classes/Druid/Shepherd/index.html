<h1 id="druidic-circle-circle-of-the-shepherd">Druidic Circle: Circle of the Shepherd</h1>
<p>Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of beasts. While these druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, they focus on protecting animals. Shepherds, as they are known, see beasts as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten natural creatures, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on habitats and paths needed for animal migrations. Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of wild animals.</p>

<h2 id="spirit-bond">Spirit Bond</h2>
<p><em>2nd-level Circle of the Shepherd feature</em></p>
<p>You gain the ability to call forth animal spirits and use them to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you magically summon a Medium spirit to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around it, it doesn't occupy its space, it is immobile, and it counts as neither a creature nor an object.</p>
<p>The nature of the aura depends on the type of spirit you choose to summon:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bear</strong>. The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. You and your allies who are in the aura when the spirit appears each gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.</li>
<li><strong>Hawk</strong>. The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, marking your enemies with its keen sight. You and your allies gain advantage on ranged attack rolls against targets in the spirit's aura.</li>
<li><strong>Wolf</strong>. The wolf spirit lends you and your allies its precise senses, while your magic works to benefit the members of your pack. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura. In addition, if you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores hit points to anyone inside or outside the aura, each of your allies in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.</li>
</ul>
<p>The spirit persists for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
