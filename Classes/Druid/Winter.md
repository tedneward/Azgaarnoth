## Druid Circle: Circle of Winter
Druids of the Circle of Winter harness the hidden powers of the frigid tundras of the world, as well as the harsh season of winter. Some of these druids make direct contact with fey courts that are associated with the winter, while others simply gain their powers due to a frozen landscape being their home.

#### Circle Spells
Your link to the season of winter grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the *frostbite* cantrip, or a different druid cantrip of your choice if you already knew it. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Winter Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| Druid Level | Spells |
|:----:|:------------- |
| 3rd | darkness, Snilloc's snowball swarm, frozen feet |
| 5th | sleet storm, wall of water |
| 7th | fire shield, ice storm |
| 9th | cone of cold, control winds, winterfloor |

#### Winter Spirit
At 2nd level, you can lower your body's temperature to below freezing through druidic magic. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to channel the might of winter, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 5 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:

- You add your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of +1) to the damage you deal with any druid cantrip or spell as additional cold damage.
- Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 cold damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

Also, you are adapted to cold climates, as described in Chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide.*

While you are channeling your Winter Spirit, your eyes take on a blazing blue color, regardless of their original color, and your hair and skin turns a bright white. All return to their original color when the feature expires.

#### Blizzard Cloud
Starting at 6th level, while you are affected by your Winter Spirit feature, a cloud of frost and snow billows around you, freezing your foes. As a bonus action on each of your turns while you are using your Winter Spirit feature, you can force one creature within 30 feet of you to succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature's movement speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

#### Slippery Magic
Beginning at 10th level, your magic is permanently touched by slippery ice. When a creature fails its saving throw against a druid spell you cast that deals cold damage, it falls prone. The bonus cold damage granted by your Winter Spirit feature does not count as a spell dealing cold damage for this feature.

#### Cold Soul
By 14th level, your body permanently resembles a creature of snow and frost. You are immune to cold damage, and when a creature hits you with a melee attack, it takes cold damage equal to half of your druid level, with no reaction on your part required.
