# Druidic Circle: Circle of the Molt
Druids of the Molt revere nature's aspects of regrowth, change, and renewal Many creatures shed their skins to replenish themselves, and many others enter periods of dormancy, change, and metamorphosis. Some animals shed their fur to grow in a thicker or lighter coat, and some even live in complex life cycles. Druids of the Molt see the beauty in these and other aspects of change in nature, such as the seasons or the weather.

The Circle of the Molt counsel their students to live an inconstant life. They teach that change will always come, that the good will bring bad, and that the bad will bring good - all in time. They believe that true wisdom can only be found by understanding the infinite expanse of different perspectives, and that the most effective way to know another perspective is to walk for some time in that creature's skin.

## Gift of New Skin
*2nd-level Circle of the Molt feature*

When you choose this circle at 2nd levei you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your tum as a bonus action, rather than as an action.

In addition, you can gift others with a new form. You can use a bonus action on your tum to touch one willing creature and transform it using your wild shape instead of transforming yourself. The transformation follows all the other normal rules for wild shape transformations and expends a usage. You make any choices, such as the form itself. Both you and the target can use an action or a bonus action to end the transformation.

Whenever your wild shape transformation ends for any creature, you can choose for it to regain hit points equal to your druid levet You can only restore hit points in this way up to three times, and you regain all expended uses of this healing when you finish a long rest.

## Shiftling
*6th-level Circle of the Molt feature*

At 6th levei your connection to the powers of regrowth and renewal grants you the aid of a formless spirit, a shiftling, taking the role of a druid familiar.

You can cast find familiar without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. It counts as a druid spell for you, and your familiar is always a fey. You can use an action or a bonus action while your druid familiar is within 30 feet of you to change its form to a new one, as you would if you had cast find familiar again.

## Baleful Polymorph
*10th-level Circle of the Molt feature*

At 10th levei you learn how to transform even your enemies to great effect, improving your skill with the polymorph spelt You always have polymorph prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare as a druid each day.

When you cast polymorph, you can choose to cast it as balefut When a baleful polymorph ends because the target's transformation was reduced to O hit points, you deal force damage to the target equal to the maximum hit points of the transformation.

In addition, you can cast polymorph with the range reduced to Touch, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you have done so, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Season of Change
*14th-level Circle of the Molt feature*

At 14th levei as you embrace the spirits of your circle, the magic of change grants you the ability to enter a state of perpetual metamorphosis. You can use a bonus action to transform using the rules for your wild shape, but without expending a wild shape usage, causing you to enter this state for 10 minutes. While in this state,
you gain the following benefits:

* At the start of each of your turns, you can choose to transform into a different creature using your wild shape rules (even if you are not in your natural form) or back to your natural form, at no cost.
* You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to avoid or escape being grappled.

When this state ends, you transform back to your natural form if you are not in that form already. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
