<h1 id="mystic-order-order-of-the-avatar">Mystic Order: Order of the Avatar</h1>
<p>Mystics of the Order of the Avatar delve into the world of emotion, mastering their inner life to such an extent that they can manipulate and amplify the emotions of others with the same ease that an artist shapes clay. Known as Avatars, these mystics vary from tyrants to inspiring leaders who are loved by their followers.</p>
<p>Avatars can bring out extreme emotions in the people around them. For their allies, they can lend hope, ferocity, and courage, transforming a fighting band into a deadly, unified force. For their enemies, they bring fear, disgust, and trepidation that can make even the most hardened veteran act like a shaky rookie.</p>
<p>The Heart of the Council of Seers in Zhi is always a mystic of the Order of the Avatar; their abilities to inspire and evoke emotion makes them the most common spokesperson to the people of Zhi, and they often serve as the interlocutor between the Council and visitors.</p>

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Call to Inaction (2 psi; concentration, 10 min.).*** If you spend 1 minute conversing with a creature, you can attempt to seed it with overwhelming ennui. At the end of the minute, you can use an action to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. On a failed save, it sits and is incapacitated until your concentration ends. This effect immediately ends if the target or any ally it can see is attacked or takes damage. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected and has no inkling of your attempt to bend its will.&quot;)

On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. You can increase the damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Psychic Focus: Crown of Disgust.*** While you are focused on this discipline, the area in a 5-foot radius around you is difficult terrain for any enemy that isn’t immune to being frightened. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Eye of Horror (1–7 psi).*** Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 psychic damage per psi point spent and can’t move closer to you until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Wall of Repulsion (3 psi; concentration, 10 min.).*** You create an invisible, insubstantial wall of energy within 60 feet of you that is up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Any creature attempting to move through it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t move through the wall until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature can pass through it. A creature must make this save whenever it attempts to pass through the wall, whether willingly or unwillingly.&quot;)

On a failed save, you cause that creature to regard all other beings as horrid, alien entities, and it takes 5d6 psychic damage, and until your concentration ends, it takes 1d6 psychic damage per creature within 5 feet of it at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the target takes only half the initial damage and suffers none of the other effects.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***World of Horror (7 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** As an action, choose up to six creatures within 60 feet of you. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 8d6 psychic damage, and it is frightened until your concentration ends. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. While frightened by this effect, a target’s speed is reduced to 0, and the target can use its action, and any bonus action it might have, only to make melee attacks. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.&quot;)

def crownofrage(npc):
    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Psychic Focus: Crown of Rage.*** While you are focused on this discipline, any enemy within 5 feet of you that makes a melee attack roll against creatures other than you does so with disadvantage. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Primal Fury (1–7 psi).*** Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage per psi point spent on this ability and immediately use its reaction to move its speed in a straight line toward its nearest enemy. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Fighting Words (2 psi; concentration, 10 min.).*** If you spend 1 minute conversing with a creature, you can attempt to leave a simmering violence in its mind. At the end of the minute, you can use an action to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw to resist feeling violent urges against one creature you describe to it or name. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed. On a failed save, the target attacks the chosen creature if it sees that creature before your concentration ends, using weapons or spells against a creature it was already hostile toward or unarmed strikes against an ally or a creature it was neutral toward. Once the fight starts, it continues to attack for 5 rounds before this effect ends. This effect immediately ends if the target or any ally it can see is attacked or takes damage from any creature other than the one it has been incited against. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected and has no inkling of your attempt to bend its will.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Mindless Courage (2 psi).*** Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or, until the end of your next turn, you cause that creature's bloodlust to overcome its sense of preservation and it can’t willingly move unless its movement brings it closer to its nearest enemy that it can see. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Punishing Fury (5 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or, until your concentration ends, you cause that creature's rage to grow so hot that it attacks without heeding its own safety, and any creature within 5 feet of it can use a reaction to make a melee attack against it whenever the target makes a melee attack. The save automatically succeeds if the target is immune to being charmed.&quot;)
