<pre><code>def nomadicarrow(npc):
    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Psychic Focus: Nomadic Arrow.*** While you are focused on this discipline, any attack roll you make for a ranged weapon attack ignores disadvantage. If disadvantage would normally apply to the roll, that roll also can’t benefit from advantage. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Speed Dart (1–7 psi).*** You imbue one ranged weapon you hold with psionic power. The next attack you make with it that hits before the end of the current turn deals an extra 1d10 psychic damage per psi point spent.&quot;)

    npc.reactions.append(&quot;***Seeking Missile (2 psi).*** When you miss with a ranged weapon attack, you can repeat the attack roll against the same target.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Faithful Archer (5 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** You imbue a ranged weapon with a limited sentience. Until your concentration ends, you can make an extra attack with the weapon at the start of each of your turns (no action required). If it is a thrown weapon, it returns to your grasp each time you make any attack with it.&quot;)

def nomadicchameleon(npc):
    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Psychic Focus: Nomadic Chameleon.*** While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Chameleon (2 psi).*** You can attempt to hide even if you fail to meet the requirements needed to do so. At the end of the current turn, you remain hidden only if you then meet the normal requirements for hiding.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Step from Sight (3 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** You cloak yourself from sight. You can target one additional creature for every additional psi point you spend on this ability. The added targets must be visible to you and within 60 feet of you. Each target turns invisible and remains so until your concentration ends or until immediately after it targets, damages, or otherwise affects any creature with an attack, a spell, or another ability.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Enduring Invisibility (7 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** You turn invisible and remain so until your concentration ends.&quot;)

def nomadicmind(npc):
    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Psychic Focus: Nomadic Mind.*** Whenever you focus on this discipline, you choose one skill or tool and have proficiency with it until your focus ends. Alternatively, you gain the ability to read and write one language of your choice until your focus ends. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.&quot;)

    npc.traits.append(&quot;***Wandering Mind (2–6 psi; concentration, 10 min.).*** You enter a deep contemplation. If you concentrate for this option’s full duration, you then gain proficiency with up to three of the following skills (one skill for every 2 psi points spent): Animal Handling, Arcana, History, Medicine, Nature, Performance, Religion, and Survival. The benefit lasts for 1 hour, no concentration required.&quot;)

    npc.traits.append(&quot;***Find Creature (2 psi; concentration, 1 hr.).*** You cast your mind about for information about a specific creature. If you concentrate for this option’s full duration, you then gain a general understanding of the creature’s current location. You learn the region, city, town, village, or district where it is, pinpointing an area between 1 and 3 miles on a side (DM’s choice). If the creature is on another plane of existence, you instead learn which plane.&quot;)

    npc.traits.append(&quot;***Item Lore (3 psi; concentration, 1 hr.).*** You carefully study an item. If you concentrate for this option’s full duration while remaining within 5 feet of the item, you then gain the benefits of an identify spell cast on that item.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Psychic Speech (5 psi).*** You attune your mind to the psychic imprint of all language. For 1 hour, you gain the ability to understand any language you hear or attempt to read. In addition, when you speak, all creatures that can understand a language understand what you say, regardless of what language you use.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Wandering Eye (6 psi; concentration, 1 hr.).*** You create a psychic sensor within 60 feet of you. The sensor lasts until your concentration ends. The sensor is invisible and hovers in the air. You mentally receive visual information from it, which has normal vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet. The sensor can look in all directions. As an action, you can move the sensor up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Phasing Eye (7 psi; concentration, 1 hr.).*** As Wandering Eye above, except the eye can move through solid objects but can’t end its movement in one. If it does so, the effect immediately ends.&quot;)

def nomadicstep(npc):
    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Psychic Focus: Nomadic Step.*** After you teleport on your turn while focused on this discipline, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, as you are propelled by the magic of your teleportation. You can receive this increase only once per turn. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Step of a Dozen Paces (1–7 psi).*** If you haven’t moved yet on your turn, you teleport up to 20 feet per psi point spent to an unoccupied space you can see, and your speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the turn.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Nomadic Anchor (1 psi).*** You create an invisible, intangible teleportation anchor in a 5-foot cube you can see within 120 feet of you. For the next 8 hours, whenever you use this psionic discipline to teleport, you can instead teleport to the anchor, even if you can’t see it, but it must be within range of the teleportation ability.&quot;)

    npc.reactions.append(&quot;***Defensive Step (2 psi).*** When you are hit by an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against that attack, possibly turning it into a miss. You then teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***There and Back Again (2 psi).*** You teleport up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space you can see and then move up to half your speed. At the end of your turn, you can teleport back to the spot you occupied before teleporting, unless it is now occupied or on a different plane of existence.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Transposition (3 psi).*** If you haven’t moved yet on your turn, choose an ally you can see within 60 feet of you. You and that creature teleport, swapping places, and your speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the turn. This ability fails and is wasted if either of you can’t fit in the destination space.&quot;)

On a failed save, you and that creature teleport, swapping places. This ability fails and is wasted if either of you can’t fit in the destination space.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Phantom Caravan (6 psi).*** You and up to six willing creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you teleport up to 1 mile to a spot you can see. If there isn’t an open space for all the targets to occupy at the arrival point, this ability fails and is wasted.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Nomad’s Gate (7 psi; concentration, 1 hr.).*** You create a 5-foot cube of dim, gray light within 5 feet of you. You create an identical cube at any point of your choice within 1 mile that you have viewed within the past 24 hours. Until your concentration ends, anyone entering one of the cubes immediately teleports to the other one, appearing in an unoccupied space next to it. The teleportation fails if there is no space for the creature to appear in.&quot;)

def thirdeye(npc): 
    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Psychic Focus: Third Eye.*** While focused on this discipline, you have darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision with that range or greater, increase its range by 10 feet. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Tremorsense (2 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** You gain tremorsense with a radius of 30 feet, which lasts until your concentration ends.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Unwavering Eye (2 psi).*** You gain advantage on Wisdom checks for 1 minute.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Piercing Sight (3 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** You gain the ability to see through objects that are up to 1 foot thick within 30 feet of you. This sight lasts until your concentration ends&quot;)
