# Precognition
*Awakened Discipline*

By analyzing information around you, from subtle hints to seemingly disconnected facts, you learn to weave a string of probabilities in an instant that gives you extraordinary insights.

***Psychic Focus.*** While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on initiative rolls.

***Precognitive Hunch (2 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** As a bonus action, you open yourself to receive momentary insights that improve your odds of success; until your concentration ends, whenever you make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you roll a d4 and add it to the total.

***All-Around Sight (3 psi).*** In response to an attack hitting you, you use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that attack roll, possibly causing it to miss.

***Danger Sense (5 psi; concentration, 8 hr.).*** As an action, you create a psychic model of reality in your mind and set it to show you a few seconds into the future. Until your concentration ends, you can’t be surprised, attack rolls against you can’t gain advantage, and you gain a +10 bonus to initiative.

***Victory Before Battle (7 psi).*** When you roll initiative, you can use this ability to grant yourself and up to five creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you a +10 bonus to initiative.
