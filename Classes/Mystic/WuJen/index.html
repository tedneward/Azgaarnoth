<p>The Order of the Wu Jen features some of the most devoted mystics. These mystics seek to lock themselves away from the world, denying the limits of the physical world and replacing it with a reality that they create for themselves.

<p>In practical terms, wu jens excel at controlling the forces of the natural world. They can hurl objects with their minds, control the four elements, and alter reality to fit their desires.</p>

It can’t be larger than 20 feet on a side, and its maximum weight depends on the psi points spent on this ability (**2**: 25 lbs; **3**: 50lbs; **5**: 250lbs; **6**: 500lbs; **7**: 1000lbs). You move the object up to 60 feet, and you must keep the object within sight during this movement. If the object ends this movement in the air, it falls. If the object would fall on a creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, the creature takes damage as given by the weight/psi spent: **2**: 2d6; **3**: 4d6; **5**: 6d6; **6**: 7d6; **7**: 8d6.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Inertial Armor (2 psi).*** You sheathe yourself in an intangible field of magical force. For 8 hours, your base AC is 14 + your Dexterity modifier, and you gain resistance to force damage. This effect ends if you are wearing or don armor.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Telekinetic Barrier (3 psi; concentration, 10 min.).*** You create a transparent wall of telekinetic energy, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 40 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 inch thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Each 10-foot section of the wall has an AC of 10 and 10 hit points.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Grasp (3 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** You attempt to grasp a creature in telekinetic energy and hold it captive. Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be grappled by you until your concentration ends or until the target leaves your reach, which is 60 feet for this grapple. The grappled target can escape by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your psionic ability plus your proficiency bonus. When a target attempts to escape in this way, you can spend psi points to boost your check, abiding by your psi limit. You gain a +1 bonus per psi point spent. While a target is grappled in this manner, you create one of the following effects as an action: **Crush (1–7 psi)**. The target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per psi point spent; **Move (1–7 psi)**. You move the target up to 5 feet per psi point spent. You can move it in the air and hold it there. It falls if the grapple ends.&quot;)

def masteryofice(npc):
    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Psychic Focus: Mastery of Ice.*** While focused on this discipline, you have resistance to cold damage. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Ice Spike (1–7 psi).*** You hurl a mote of ice at one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 cold damage per psi point spent and has its speed halved until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Ice Sheet (2 psi).*** Choose a point on the ground you can see within 60 feet of you. The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point becomes covered in ice for 10 minutes. It is difficult terrain, and any creature that moves more than 10 feet on it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. If the surface is sloped, a creature that falls prone in the area immediately slides to the bottom of the slope.&quot;)

    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Frozen Sanctuary (3 psi).*** You sheathe yourself with icy resilience. You gain 20 temporary hit points.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Frozen Rain (5 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** Choose a point you can see within 120 feet of you. The air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point becomes deathly cold and saturated with moisture. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 6d6 cold damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until your concentration ends. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. A target that has its speed reduced can end the effect early if it succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC equal to this effect’s save DC. You can increase this effect’s damage by 1d6 per each additional psi point spent on it.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Ice Barrier (6 psi; concentration, 10 min.).*** You create a wall of ice, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 12 and 30 hit points. A creature that damages the wall with a melee attack takes cold damage equal to the damage the creature dealt to the wall.&quot;)

def masteryoflightanddarkness(npc):
    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Psychic Focus: Mastery of Light and Darkness.*** While focused on this discipline, natural and magical darkness within 30 feet of you has no effect on your vision. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Darkness (1–7 psi).*** You create an area of magical darkness, which foils darkvision. Choose a spot you can see within 60 feet of you. Magical darkness radiates from that point in a sphere with a 10-foot radius per psi point spent on this ability. The light produced by spells of 2nd level or less is suppressed in this area.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Light (2 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** An object you touch radiates light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light lasts until your concentration ends. Alternatively, a creature you touch radiates light in the same manner if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. While lit in this manner, it can’t hide, and attack rolls against it gain advantage.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Shadow Beasts (3 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** You cause two shadows to appear in unoccupied spaces you can see within 60 feet of you. The shadows last until your concentration ends, and they obey your verbal commands. In combat, roll for their initiative, and choose their behavior during their turns.

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Radiant Beam (5 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** You project a beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6d6 radiant damage and is blinded until your concentration ends. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. A blinded target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can increase this effect’s damage by 1d6 per each additional psi point spent on it.&quot;)

def masteryofwater(npc):
    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Psychic Focus: Mastery of Water.*** While focused on this discipline, you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater. The benefit lasts until you are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a different focus benefit. You can have only one psychic focus benefit at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn't limit your ability to use other disciplines.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Desiccate (1–7 psi).*** Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 1d10 necrotic damage per psi point spent on this ability, or half as much damage on a successful one.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Watery Grasp (2 psi).*** You unleash a wave that surges forth and then retreats to you like the rising tide. You create a wave in a 20-foot-by-20-foot square. At least some portion of the square’s border must be within 5 feet of you. Any creature in that square must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is pulled up to 10 feet closer to you. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage. You can increase this ability’s damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Water Whip (3 psi).*** You unleash a jet of water in a line that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide.

You can increase this ability’s damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Water Breathing (5 psi).*** You grant yourself and up to ten willing creatures you can see within 60 feet of you the ability to breathe underwater for the next 24 hours.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Water Sphere (6 psi; concentration, 1 min.).*** You cause a sphere of water to form around a creature. Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes trapped in the sphere of water until your concentration ends. While the target is trapped, its speed is halved, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, and it can’t see anything more than 10 feet away from it. However, attack rolls against it also suffer disadvantage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful one.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Animate Water (7 psi; concentration, 1 hr.).*** You cause a water elemental to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The elemental lasts until your concentration ends, and it obeys your verbal commands. In combat, roll for its initiative, and choose its behavior during its turns. When this effect ends, the elemental disappears. See the Monster Manual for its stat block.&quot;)

def masteryofweather(npc):
    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Psychic Focus: Mastery of Weather.*** While focused on this discipline, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage.

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Wall of Clouds (2 psi; concentration, 10 min.).*** You create a wall of clouds, at least one portion of which must be within 60 feet of you. The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Creatures can pass through it without hindrance, but the wall blocks vision.&quot;)

    npc.actions.append(&quot;***Whirlwind (2 psi).*** Choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Winds howl in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage and be moved to an unoccupied space of your choice in the sphere.

The wall is 60 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Every foot moved through the wall costs 1 extra foot of movement. When a creature moves into the wall’s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or it takes 6d6 thunder damage, is pushed in a straight line up to 30 feet away from the wall, and is knocked prone.&quot;)

Each creature in that area must make Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 8d6 thunder damage, and it is stunned until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.&quot;)

def masteryofwoodandearth(npc):
    npc.bonusactions.append(&quot;***Psychic Focus: Mastery of Wood and Earth.*** While focused on this discipline, you have a +1 bonus to AC.
