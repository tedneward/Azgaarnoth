> Second in strength only to the leonal, the fearsome presence of a ursinal was intimidating, but they were actually quite prone to encouraging others to nonviolence. Philosophers and academics, the ursinal kept the lore and history of the guardinals as living testaments to everything they were, are, or ever will be.
