## Dread Wraith
A dread wraith is the dead soul of a once-mighty but particularly wicked ruler. After descending into the Lower Planes, it is saturated with negative energy by a fiend lord and sent back to the Material Plane. There it exists in a quasi-corporeal state with shadowy substance only sufficient to manipulate objects. Most wear dark robes over a breastplate and carry a rapier ensorcelled by their pollution until compelled to let them fall to the ground to escape physical restraint.

Dread wraiths are unleashed to continue their bloody conquests in the name of a fiend lord or an incredibly powerful necromancer. Shadows of their former memories and personality remain to them, though driven now by a restless malevolence.

***Lord of the Dead.*** A dread wraith can create and attract armies of undead. Any undead within 1 mile can sense the presence of the dread wraith, and undead of CR 3 or lower are drawn toward the dread wraith and compelled to obey it.

>
>#### Legendary Actions
>The dread wraith can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dread wraith regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
>***Breath of Death.*** One living being within 10 feet of the dread wraith must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and have its hit point maximum reduced (as Life Drain). The dread wraith regains a number of hit points equal to the damage caused. A creature cannot be targeted by this effect more than once per round.
>
>***Create Undead.*** A humanoid within 15 feet of the dread wraith that has been dead for no longer than 1 hour immediately rises as an undead creature under the wraith's control. If the target was killed by Life Drain or Breath of Death, it rises as a normal wraith. If killed by any other manner, it rises as a wight.
>
>***Cause Fear (Costs 2 Actions).***  Every living being within 2 0 feet of the dread wraith must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute . While frightened, creatures must take the Dash action and move away from the dread wraith by the safest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its t urns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw succeeds in ending the effect, the creature is immune to the dread wraith's Cause Fear for the next 24 hours.
