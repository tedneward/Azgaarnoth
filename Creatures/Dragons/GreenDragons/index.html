<h1 id="green-dragons">Green Dragons</h1>
<p>Green dragons are conniving, deceitful creatures. The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies. Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little effort as possible. As an elder green once put it, "Hunting for dinner is no fun. Getting your dinner to offer itself to you? That is fun."</p>
<p>Green dragons view all creatures as lesser, and therfore as either prey or pawn; more often than naught, a green dragon will corrupt politicians, whether through threat or bribery, in a neighboring town to gain power by proxy, just for the fun of it. Even so, greens will negotiate to live peacefully with their neighbors, but one should be very wary when entering into any such contract, as nothing makes a green dragon's heart sing with joy more than finding a loophole and exploiting it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Manipulative Schemers.</em></strong> A wily and subtle creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.</p>
<p>When manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass, and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and status.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conflict and Corruption.</em></strong> Green dragons sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down, only to wait and watch -- sometimes for decades -- for the chance to slay the other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.</p>
<p>Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity, with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those minions' tortured dreams.</p>
<h3 id="appearance">Appearance</h3>
<p>A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.</p>
<p>A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing edges.</p>
<p>A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.</p>
<h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>
<p>Greens prefer sentient mammalians, with a particular taste for elves, but such prey is rare, so they usually subsist on forest life such as deer, bears, and wolves.</p>
<h3 id="tactics">Tactics</h3>
<p>Greens are just as comfortable fighting on the ground as they are in the air, likely due to the dense vegetation that limits their flight when hunting. They take cover in trees or behind hills and boulders; the trees prove more of a hindrance to the arrows of humanoids than they do to the poisonous gas of the dragon.</p>
<p>Greens also spend most of their time patrolling their territory, not just looking for intruders, but memorizing the landscape and every possible hiding place and path through the trees.</p>
<p>If given the opportunity, a green dragon will attempt to talk to its foes. They are among the most cunning of dragons, and they are fully aware of the time constraints of spells and other such effects, so they will try to hold a conversation long enough for those effects to wear off. During the course of the conversation, the dragon will attempt to get its foes to lower their guard (of course lying through its teeth the whole time), while leading them into a disadvantageous position (such as grouping them in such a way that a single breath weapon attack would hit them all). Then, when the dragon has them exactly where it wants them, it drops all cordiality and attacks.</p>
<p>Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for creatures that can help it further its ambitions.</p>
<p>A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed. Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.</p>
<h3 id="terrain-and-habitat">Terrain and Habitat</h3>
<p>Green dragons prefer temperate or cold forests to wet jungles or nonforested areas, but they will take the latter in the absence of the former. They particularly love old forests with large trees.</p>
<h3 id="lairs">Lairs</h3>
<p>If they can find one, green dragons prefer caves in forested hills and cliffsides. Some have been known to topple enormous trees into piles and lair inside of these makeshift huts, and still others have set up residence in enormous trees touched by fey magic.</p>
<h3 id="favored-treasure">Favored Treasure</h3>
<p>Green dragons love any treasure that required a lot of work to be put into it, such as a large sculpture or a magic sword. They keep coins and gems around as a part of their hoard, which they sometimes use (sparingly, as they hate parting with any bit of their hoard) to bribe or coerce minions into doing things that will ultimately bring them greater wealth, power, or amusement. A green dragon favors emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid subjects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Living Treasures.</em></strong> A green dragon's favored treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and renowned bards. </p>
<h3 id="environmental-diffusion">Environmental Diffusion</h3>
<p>When a Green Dragon undergoes Environmental Diffusion, the area becomes overgrown with dense, enormous, beautiful, and deadly plant life, which can range from bushes and flowers to enormous trees, but all of it is poisonous. These areas are often connected to the Feywild.</p>
<h3 id="green-dragon-feats">Green Dragon <a href="../DraconicFeats/">Feats</a></h3>
<p>The following feats can only be taken by green dragons.</p>
<h4 id="acrid-dragon">Acrid Dragon</h4>
<p>The dragon has resistance to acid damage.</p>
<h4 id="command-plants">Command Plants</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Ancient or older.</em></p>
<p>The dragon gains the following action option:</p>
<p><strong>Command Plants (1/Day).</strong> The dragon targets a number of plant creatures within 120 feet of it and whose combined Challenge Rating is less than or equal to the dragon's. All affected creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (save DC = 8 + the dragon's proficiency bonus + the dragon's Charisma modifier) or be dominated by the dragon as if by a <a href="../../../Magic/Spells/dominate-monster/">dominate monster</a> spell.</p>
<h4 id="dominating-presence">Dominating Presence</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisites: must be a spellcaster with at least one charm spell; must be Adult or older.</em></p>
<p>When targeting a creature of the dragon's Challenge Rating or lower, the dragon's charms ignore resistance to (or advantage on saves against) the charmed condition. In addition, the dragon can use a bonus or legendary action to exert precise control of creatures it has charmed or dominated.</p>
<h4 id="forest-dragon">Forest Dragon</h4>
<p>The dragon has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forest environments.</p>
<h4 id="inscrutable">Inscrutable</h4>
<p>Wisdom (Perception or Insight) checks made to ascertain the dragon's intentions or sincerity are made with disadvantage.</p>
<h4 id="mind-of-steel">Mind of Steel</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Inscrutable.</em></p>
<p>The dragon has resistance to psychic damage.</p>
<h4 id="persistent-poison">Persistent Poison</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.</em></p>
<p>After the dragon uses its breath weapon, a cloud of gas lingers in the breath weapon's area. A creature that starts its turn there or enters the area for the first time on its turn must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (save DC = Poison Breath save DC), or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The area in the cloud is lightly obscured, and the cloud lasts for 2 (1d4) rounds or until cleared by strong wind.</p>
<h4 id="poison-environment">Poison Environment</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.</em></p>
<p>The dragon can, over time, poison the thorns and branches of plants in the area around its lair. Any creature that makes contact with a poisoned plant takes 2 (1d4) poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (save DC = Poison Breath save DC) or be poisoned for 1 hour.</p>
<h4 id="poisonous-blood">Poisonous Blood</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.</em></p>
<p>When the dragon has half of its hitpoints remaining or less, if a creature within 5 feet of it hits it with a weapon attack, the attacker takes 10 (3d6) poison damage.</p>
<h4 id="potent-poison">Potent Poison</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.</em></p>
<p>The dragon's attacks ignore resistance to poison damage. When the dragon rolls poison damage, it can treat any 1 rolled on a damage die as a 2.</p>
<h4 id="silver-tongue">Silver Tongue</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Smooth Talker; must be Mature Adult or older.</em></p>

<h3 id="a-green-dragons-lair">A Green Dragon's Lair</h3>
<p>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled. At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
<li>A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
<li>Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns. Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</p>

That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
<li>A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
<li>Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects_1">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns. Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within 1 mile of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rodents and birds within 1 mile of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</p>

<h3 id="a-green-dragons-lair_2">A Green Dragon's Lair</h3>
<p>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled. At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions_2">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>

<p>Within 2 miles of its lair, the dragon leaves no physical evidence of its passage unless it wishes to. Tracking it there is impossible except by magical means. In addition, it ignores movement impediments and damage from plants in this area that are neither magical nor creatures, including the thickets described above. The plants remove themselves from the dragon's path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rodents and birds within 2 miles of the dragon's lair serve as the dragon's eyes and ears. Deer and other large game are strangely absent, hinting at the presence of an unnaturally hungry predator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, the rodents and birds lose their supernatural link to it. The thickets remain, but within 1d10 days, they become mundane plants and normal difficult terrain, losing their thorns.</p>

<h4 id="actions_10">Actions</h4>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 84 (24d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h4 id="legendary-actions_5">Legendary Actions</h4>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn</p>
<p><strong><em>Detect.</em></strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail Attack.</em></strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.

<h3 id="a-green-dragons-lair_5">A Green Dragon's Lair</h3>
<p>The forest-loving green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid whiff of the creature's poison breath. The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and every sound seems muffled. At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams. Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions_5">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes two lair actions to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect twice in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grasping roots and vines erupt in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature there must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots and vines. A creature can be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeds. The roots and vines wilt away when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
<li>A wall of tangled brush bristling with thorns springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the save takes 18 (4d8) piercing damage and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, a creature in the wall's space must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the wall, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of wall has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall sinks back into the ground when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>
<li>Magical fog billows around one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects_5">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary green dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thickets form labyrinthine passages within 4 miles of the dragon's lair. The thickets act as 10-foot-high, 10-foot-thick walls that block line of sight. Creatures can move through the thickets, with every 1 foot a creature moves costing it 4 feet of movement. A creature in the thickets must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw once each round it's in contact with the thickets or take 3 (1d6) piercing damage from thorns. Each 10-foot-cube of thickets has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage.</p>
