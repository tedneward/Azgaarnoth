# Blue Dragons
Of all the chromatic dragons, blue dragons (also called storm dragons) are the most vain and arrogant, they soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.

A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.

A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.

***Vain and Deadly.*** A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.

They love wielding their tremendous power and ruling over humanoids or creatures alike, but not for practical means or results; they only want to prove that they can do so. Blue dragons are one of the few dragons that can forgive insult, but if one dares to insinuate that the dragon is weak or inferior, they had better brace themselves for the torrential wrath that is the dragon's. They are particularly territorial and are prone to attacking intruders, but are willing to listen to whatever excuses the creature has in store (especially if such excuses involve flattering the dragon).

If given the proper respect it believes it deserves, blue dragons can be reasonable. They have been known to be peaceful neighbors with humanoid kingdoms or even other chromatic dragons, simply because the other party respects the dragon's pride and territorial conditions. They may even take an opportunity to employ humanoids, as they love the display of power, and the feeling of accomplishment without having to do anything.

***Desert Predators.*** Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.

When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.

### Diet
Blue dragons prefer large prey such as cattle, and they like having only a few very large meals as opposed to several small ones. They do not purposefully hunt sentient life, as black dragons might, but if a blue dragon is hungry and has the opportunity, it will not pass it up. For whatever reason, they like their meat fresh and slightly charred, but not cooked through. In other words: freshly killed with lightning.

### Tactics
Blues consider combat a long-term engagement that can take several minutes or hours, depending on the strength of the adversary. Of all dragons, they are the most likely to attack opponents bigger and stronger than themselves for their pride's sake. Because of this, they prefer long-range attacks while flying during battle. They will unleash barrages of lightning for hours without coming down.

### Terrain and Habitat
Blue dragons like to live anywhere stormy, but especially along the ocean or particularly stormy isles. They may also live along thunderous mountain ridges or seaside cliffs, or even a rainforest. If a blue dragon cannot find such a place, it may settle wherever it is; that is, anyplace except arctic terrain. However, in the dragon's eyes, these lairs are always temporary, because a blue dragon longs to hear thunder and fly through clouds strewn with lightning.

### Lairs
Blue dragons like to make their lairs at the tops of peaks where they can survey their territory and be one with a storm as it rolls through. They favor enormous stone ruins or caves in the sides of mountains, cliffs, or hills. If they can help it, they prefer ruins the most, which probably has something to do with their pride. If for some reason they cannot lair at the peak or near it, they still make their lairs accessible only by flight, so would-be intruders must suffer through painstaking, and sometimes impossible, climbs.

***Overlords and Minions.*** Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.

A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.

### Favored Treasure
Blue dragons like treasure that is as pretty to look at as it is valuable. Particularly they love gems, especially blue ones, but they also have a love for art and jewelry. Rarely, a blue dragon actually leaves some treasure behind because the dragon felt that it was unattractive, and therefore would detract from the greatness of the hoard and, by extension, of the dragon itself.

A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.


### Physical Characteristics
The scales of a blue dragon are more reflective than those of the other chromatic dragons. They cannot be used as mirrors, but when in blue or dark environments (such as the sky during the day or night, respectively), their scales take on the associated color and allow them to blend in. The enormous prominent horn on its nose, in addition to being an effective bashing weapon, is practically used in conjunction with its brow as a rain funnel to keep precipitation out of its eyes. This gives it enhanced vision during storms. They might smell of ozone, but the smell is easily masked by wind or inclement weather.

### Environmental Diffusion
A blue dragon that undergoes Environmental Diffusion creates a permanent storm in the vicinity, even underground. The severity of the storm may rise or fall, but the storm itself never dies completely, regardless of the weather happening around or outside of it.

### Blue Dragon [Feats](DraconicFeats.md)
The following feats can only be taken by blue dragons.

#### Lightning Aura
*Prerequisite: must be Juvenile or older.*

Each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the dragon or moves there for the first time on its turn takes 5 (1d10) lightning damage.

#### Lightning Marksman
Whenever the dragon uses its Lightning Breath, it can double the breath's range. If the breath is modified in this way, it deals half of its usual damage.

#### Horn Attack
*Prerequisite: must have ***Multiattack.****

When the dragon uses its Multiattack action option, instead of making a Bite attack, the dragon can make a Horn attack.

**Horn.** Melee Weapon Attack: bonus to hit and reach are equal to Bite attack, one target. Hit: (1d12 + Strength modifier) bludgeoning damage, plus an additional 6 (1d12) damage for each size category the dragon is above Medium. If the dragon is Huge or larger, the target must make a Constitution saving throw (save DC = 8 + the dragon's proficiency bonus + the dragon's Strength modifier) or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

#### Primeval Lightning
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

The dragon's attacks ignore resistance to lightning damage. When the dragon rolls lightning damage, it can treat any 1 rolled on a damage die as a 2. In addition, a creature in metal armor has disadvantage on saving throws to evade the dragon's Breath Weapon.

#### Sky Camouflage
The dragon can use the Hide action when it is flying at a higher altitude than those it is hiding from, even if there is nowhere to hide.

#### Sound Imitation
*Prerequisite: must be Juvenile or older.*

The dragon can mimic any sound or voice that it has heard, any time it likes. To discern the ruse, a creature can attempt a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the dragon's Charisma (Deception) check. If the creature wins the contest, it learns that the sound is false, but doesn't learn its source.

#### Storm Dragon
The dragon can fly normally even in storm-strength winds. In addition, its vision is not obscured by precipitation, and it ignores cover granted by rain. The dragon also gains
resistance to thunder damage.

#### Stunning Lightning
*Prerequisite: Primeval Lightning.*

A creature who fails its saving throw against the dragon's Breath Weapon is also stunned until the end of the dragon's next turn.

#### Thunder Breath
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

The dragon gains the following action option:

**Thunder Breath (1/Day).** The dragon calls upon the powers of the storm to unleash a monstrous roar that shakes the foundations of the world. All creatures within the range must make a Constitution saving throw (save DC = Lightning Breath save DC), taking thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature who fails the save is also stunned until the end of its next turn.

The range and damage are given in the following table.

**Thunder Breath**
Dragon Age|Range (radius)|Damage
----------|--------------|------
Mature Adult|80 ft|77 (14d10)
Old |100 ft|88 (16d10)
Elder |120 ft|93 (17d10)
Ancient |140 ft|99 (18d10)
Wyrm |170 ft|104 (19d10)
Great Wyrm |200 ft|110 (20d10)

#### Veil
*Prerequisite: must be Ancient or older.*

The dragon gains the following action option:

**Veil (1/Day).** The dragon casts seeming, but it can target each creature within its lair that it is aware of. The dragon can perfectly replicate specific creatures and objects that it has seen. The effects are otherwise identical to the spell's description.

#### Ventriloquism
*Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.*

The dragon can "throw" its voice (or any other sound it makes) to make it sound like it is coming from a point or creature of its choice that it can see within 120 feet of it. A creature who succeeds on a Wisdom (Insight) check against the dragon's Charisma (Deception) check recognizes it as illusory, but doesn't discern the sound's true source.

### A Blue Dragon's Lair
Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands. Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon's first line of defense. A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions — along with the wealth of the dead intruders.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.
* A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
* Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

* Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.
* Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (−5).
* Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 × 10 feet into the sinkhole.

If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.

* Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

* Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.
* Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (−5).
* Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 × 10 feet into the sinkhole.

If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.

### A Blue Dragon's Lair
Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands. Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon's first line of defense. A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions — along with the wealth of the dead intruders.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.
* A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
* Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

* Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.
* Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (−5).
* Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 × 10 feet into the sinkhole.

If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.

* Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

* Thunderstorms rage within 24 miles of the lair.
* Dust devils scour the land within 24 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (−5).
* Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 × 10 feet into the sinkhole.

If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.
