<h1 id="black-dragons">Black Dragons</h1>
<p>Also called "skull dragons" for the shape of their heads, black dragons are the most malicious chromatic dragons. The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. They revel in causing pain and will hunt, not just for food, but because they thoroughly enjoy causing pain. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. Ironically, they are also the most cowardly, and will quickly run from a fight when things start to turn sour.</p>

<p>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home. With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Brutal and Cruel.</em></strong> All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies. Their favorite things to feed on are sentient beings, but they have a special taste for fey creatures, which they relish as delicacy. They also feast on various swamp creatures such as small mammals and alligators, but many black dragons have rancid pools of water somewhere in their lair where they allow fresh meat to "pickle" for days at a time before eating it. They prefer the texture and flavor of such putrefied meat.</p>
<h3 id="tactics">Tactics</h3>
<p>A black dragon always makes its lair near water, and its favorite hunting strategy is to lie in wait beneath murky water for unsuspecting passersby. From the water (or if forced into the air), it will blast foes with its acid breath and then retreat back into the water (or the sky) to wait for it to recharge. If engaged in melee, it may attempt to grapple a single target and drag them down into the water where it can finish the creature off with ease.</p>
<p>When they can, Black Dragons always choose to fight in the water or on the wing; never will they fight on the ground by choice.</p>
<p>A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.</p>
<h3 id="terrain-and-habitat">Terrain and Habitat</h3>
<p>Black dragons prefer swamps with thick trees and vegetation, and deep murky water; if the swamp is too shallow, these dragons will likely not live there because deeper water suits their needs for combat and building lairs. If a black dragon cannot find a deep swamp, it may settle for any place water comes into contact with land in great quantities, such as jungles, rainforests, or occasionally even lakes in nearly any terrain (aside from cold). That said, they never make homes in places with salt water, as salt water irritates their flesh like a bad rash.</p>
<p>Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master's domain.</p>
<p>A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.</p>
<p>Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.</p>
<h3 id="lairs">Lairs</h3>
<p>They like make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood. A black dragon usually chooses a network of caves or a hollow with multiple chambers. Some of the caverns are submerged and the lair nearly always has its main entrance hidden underwater in the bog, secured with a layer of strategically placed vegetation or a wall of mud. The lair also has an above-ground exit that the dragon keeps equally well-hidden.</p>
<h3 id="favored-treasure">Favored Treasure</h3>
<p>Black dragons value coins above all other treasure. This is because coins can withstand the wear of time, especially while submerged in the dragon's lair. It is unclear why they do not prefer gems, which would last even longer, but scholars speculate that it is because coins are refined, and therefore are intrinsically of more value than gems.</p>
<p>They especially covet coins or other artifacts from ancient civilizations or empires that they have outlasted.</p>
<h3 id="environmental-diffusion">Environmental Diffusion</h3>
<p>When a dead black dragon experiences Environmental Diffusion, the magical energies that were a part of its living body disperse into the environment. The result is abnormal humidity and foul soil. Few plants grow there, and those that do are poisonous. If water pools over the grave of the dragon, it becomes acidic and hurts to touch. This water loses that property when taken.</p>
<h3 id="physical-traits">Physical Traits</h3>
<p>A black dragons horn's actually serve no offensive purpose; they are purely defensive, to protect the dragon's head. Its eyes are sunken, furthering the skull-like appearance, but underwater the dragon's eyes bulge almost comically, allowing it improved depth perception and awareness in even the murkiest of bogs. Its phalanges are webbed, but the webbing is more prominent on the back paws than on the front. They can absorb water through their skin like some other amphibians, but they must surface to breathe air for a few hours at least once or twice a week. They have a strong, acidic scent.</p>
<h3 id="black-dragon-feats">Black Dragon <a href="../DraconicFeats/">Feats</a></h3>
<h4 id="acid-blast">Acid Blast</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.</em></p>
<p>The dragon gains a new Breath Weapon option:</p>
<p><strong>Acid Blast.</strong> The dragon chooses a point on the ground within 60 feet of it that it can see, and then exhales an acidic bomb that lands on that point. All creatures within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to half of the dragon's Acid Breath damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. A pool of residual acid forms in that same area. Any creature that starts its turn in the pool or enters the area for the first time on its turn takes 13 (3d8) acid damage. The pool is difficult terrain and dissipates after 3 (1d6) rounds, or until cleared (such as by running water).</p>
<h4 id="acidic-blood">Acidic Blood</h4>
<p>When the dragon has half of its hit points remaining or less, if it is hit by an attack from a creature within 5 feet of it, the attacker takes 9 (2d8) acid damage.</p>
<h4 id="charm-reptiles">Charm Reptiles</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.</em></p>
<p>The dragon gains the following action option:</p>
<p><strong>Charm Reptiles (3/Day).</strong> The dragon casts <a href="">animal friendship</a> on all reptiles within 30 feet of it, without requiring material components. The dragon can communicate with any charmed animals as if it had cast a <a href="">speak with animals</a> spell.</p>
<h4 id="corrupt-water">Corrupt Water</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.</em></p>
<p>The dragon gains the following action option:</p>
<p><strong>Corrupt Water (1/Day).</strong> The dragon magically stagnates up to 10 cubic feet of a body of water that it can see within 120 feet of it, making it become still, foul, and unable to sustain animal life. The water remains corrupt until purified, such as by a <a href="">purify food and drink</a> spell. Any creature to drink the water regurgitates it in 1d4 minutes and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.</p>
<h4 id="death-dragon">Death Dragon</h4>
<p>The dragon has resistance to necrotic and poison damage, and has advantage on saving throws made to resist becoming poisoned.</p>
<h4 id="horn-parry">Horn Parry</h4>
<p>The dragon gains the following reaction option:</p>
<p><strong>Horn Parry.</strong> The dragon adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the dragon must be aware of the attacker.</p>
<h4 id="potent-acid">Potent Acid</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.</em></p>
<p>The dragon's attacks ignore resistance to acid damage. When the dragon rolls acid damage, it can treat any 1 rolled on a damage die as a 2.</p>
<h4 id="swamp-dragon">Swamp Dragon</h4>
<p>The dragon ignores cover granted by water, and has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide while submerged.</p>
<h4 id="vile-resolve">Vile Resolve</h4>
<p>The dragon can add double its proficiency bonus on saving throws against being charmed, dominated, or frightened.</p>
<h4 id="viscous-acid">Viscous Acid</h4>
<p>If a creature takes damage from the dragon's Breath Weapon, acid sticks to the creature's armor and flesh. At the beginning of each of its turns, the creature takes 9 (2d8) acid damage until it or another creature takes an action to either clean off or neutralize the acid.</p>

<h3 id="a-black-dragons-lair">A Black Dragon's Lair</h3>
<p>Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The land within 3 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water sources within 1/2 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fog lightly obscures the land within 3 miles of the lair.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days.</p>

<h4 id="actions_7">Actions</h4>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) acid damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> The dragon exhales acid in a 70-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 58 (13d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h4 id="legendary-actions_2">Legendary Actions</h4>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Detect.</em></strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail Attack.</em></strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.

<h3 id="a-black-dragons-lair_2">A Black Dragon's Lair</h3>
<p>Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions_2">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects_2">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days.</p>

<p><strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> The dragon can breathe air and water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</em></strong> If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<h4 id="actions_11">Actions</h4>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> The dragon exhales acid in a 100-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 76 (17d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h4 id="legendary-actions_6">Legendary Actions</h4>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Detect.</em></strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail Attack.</em></strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.

<h3 id="a-black-dragons-lair_6">A Black Dragon's Lair</h3>
<p>Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions_6">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects_6">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days.</p></div>
