<h1 id="dragon-turtles">Dragon Turtles</h1>
<p>Dragon turtles are among the most fearsome creatures of the oceans. As large and voracious as the oldest of its land-based dragon kin, a dragon turtle strikes with its deadly jaws, steaming breath, and crushing tail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#adult-dragon-turtle">Adult</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A dragon turtle's rough shell is the same dark green color as the deep water where this monster dwells. Silver highlights lining the shell resemble light dancing on open water, and a surfacing dragon turtle is sometimes mistaken for the reflection of the sun or moon on the waves.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dragons of the Deep.</em></strong> Like true dragons, dragon turtles collect treasure, first by sinking ships and then by sifting through the wreckage for coins and other precious items. A dragon turtle swallows treasure for transport, then regurgitates it when it reaches its lair.</p>
<p>Dragon turtles dwell in caves hidden in coral reefs or beneath the seafloor, or along rugged stretches of coastline. If a choice cave is already inhabited, a dragon turtle attacks its current residents in an attempt to take over.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mercenary Monsters.</em></strong> A dragon turtle is smart enough to be bribed, and pirates sailing seas patrolled by these creatures quickly learn to offer them treasure in exchange for safe passage. Clever sahuagin sometimes ally with dragon turtles, enticing them with treasure to use their blistering breath weapons in sahuagin raids against ships and coastal settlements.</p>
<p><strong><em>Elemental Might.</em></strong> Dragon turtles sometimes find their way through sunken planar rifts to the Elemental Plane of Water. </p>
<h3 id="dragon-turtle-feats">Dragon Turtle Feats</h3>
<p>Some dragon turtles, whether through pacts, training, or bloodline, are stronger than others. These extra strengths and abilities are represented by Dragon Turtle Feats. Dragon turtles can have a multitude of additional traits, actions, or legendary actions.</p>
<p>A dragon turtle can choose a number of Dragon Feats up to the numeric equiavalent of its age category, to a maximum of 4. So a Wyrmling can choose only 1 Dragon Feat, while an Ancient can choose up to 4 Dragon Turtle Feats. Actions, Reactions, and Legendary Actions included with traits do not count against this number.</p>
<p>These feats are also meant to add difficulty to a dragon encounter, especially by countering the abilities and feats of Player Characters; remember that it isn't very fun as a player to have all of your abilities compromised by an ability that the monster has. Some dragons may choose particularly deadly combinations, such as Tough combined with Hard Scales and Mundane Weapon Resistance; Rend paired with Sweeping Claws; or Mobile with Swift and Strafing.</p>
<p>If a feat has prerequisites, the dragon turtle must fulfill all of those prerequisites before it can take that feat. Each feat can be taken only once, unless the feat's description states otherwise.</p>
<h4 id="alert">Alert</h4>
<p>The dragon turtle is particularly aware of its surrounding. It gains the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dragon turtle gains a +5 bonus to initiative rolls.</li>
<li>The dragon turtle cannot be surprised while it is conscious.</li>
<li>Creatures do not gain advantage on attack rolls by being hidden from the dragon turtle.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="arcane-immunity">Arcane Immunity</h4>
<p>The dragon turtle is immune to magic <a href="../Magic/Spells/sleep.md">sleep</a> effects, and to the paralyzed and petrified conditions.</p>
<h4 id="aura-of-despair">Aura of Despair</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Terrifying Presence.</em></p>
<p>The dragon exudes such a terrifying aura that creatures near it lose their will to fight in battle. Each creature that fails its saving throw against the dragon's Frightful Presence takes a -2 penalty to all attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute, or until it succeeds the save.</p>
<h4 id="brute">Brute</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Strength 18.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle deals an extra die of damage whenever it hits with a melee weapon attack.</p>
<h4 id="change-shape">Change Shape</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must not already have the Change Shape action option.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle shapeshifts according to the Change Shape ability possessed by metallic dragons. Dragon turtles often do not have this ability mastered in the way that metallic dragons do, and so only have one or two alternate forms. However, they frequently learn how to take the form of humanoids, since it allows them opportunities to see more of the surface world (and evaluate treasure on board ships more effectively).</p>
<h4 id="colossal">Colossal</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Ancient.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle's size is Colossal, and its space is a 25 to 30 foot square. It has advantage on Strength checks against Huge or smaller creatures. Medium or smaller creatures can enter the dragon turtle's space and vice versa, and the dragon turtle gains the Stomp reaction, the modified Bite action, and the Swallow action. The dragon turtle can make a Swallow attack instead of a Bite attack as part of its Multiattack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> (Range, damage, and targets equal to original values.) If the target is a creature, the dragon turtle can choose to grapple it (escape DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Strength modifier). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the dragon turtle can't bite another target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stomp.</em></strong> The dragon turtle can make a claw attack against a creature that ends its turn in the dragon's space.</p>
<p><strong><em>Swallow.</em></strong> The dragon turtle makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the dragon, and it takes 28 (8d6) acid damage, and 28 (8d6) steam (fire) damage at the start of each of the dragon's turns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the dragon turtle takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the dragon turtle must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the dragon. If the dragon turtle dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p>
<h4 id="crush">Crush</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: size Large or larger.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle gains the Crush action option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Crush.</em></strong> The dragon turtle throws itself at an enemy creature and lands centered on that creature's space. All creatures within the dragon turtle's new space must make a Dexterity saving throw (save DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Strength modifier). The target makes the saving throw with disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature is pushed safely to the nearest unoccupied space. On a failed save, the creature takes 6 (1d12) plus 6 (1d12) bludgeoning damage for every size category the dragon turtle is above Medium (plus Strength modifier), and the creature is restrained by the dragon turtle, and both are considered prone. If the dragon turtle starts its turn on top of a creature restrained in this way, the creature takes the same damage. At the end of its turns, any restrained creature can attempt to escape as if trying to escape a grapple. The restrained condition ends when the dragon turtle ends the prone condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="damage-absorption">Damage Absorption</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Ancient or older.</em></p>
<p>Whenever the dragon turtle would take fire damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt.</p>
<h4 id="empowered-bite">Empowered Bite</h4>
<p>The dragon turtle's bite attacks also deal extra fire damage. The damage varies by the dragon's age, as given in the table.</p>
<p><strong>Elemental Bite Damage</strong></p>

</table>
<h4 id="endurance">Endurance</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Tough.</em></p>
<p>The first time the dragon turtle is reduced to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead, unless the damage was from a critical hit. Once the dragon turtle uses this feat, it can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="epic-will">Epic Will</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle doubles its proficiency bonus on Wisdom saving throws.</p>
<h4 id="furious-onslaught">Furious Onslaught</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must have Multiattack.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle gains a new action option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Furious Onslaught.</em></strong> The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes a claw attack against every creature in its reach. It can also make one bite attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="hard-scales">Hard Scales</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Constitution 18.</em></p>
<p>Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that the dragon turtle takes from nonmagical weapons is reduced by 2. This cannot reduce the damage below 1.</p>
<h4 id="improved-spellcasting">Improved Spellcasting</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Innate Spellcasting, Intelligence 15.</em></p>
<p>The highest level spell that the dragon turtle can cast increases by one level.</p>
<h4 id="indomitable-will">Indomitable Will</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Epic Will.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle is immune to being charmed or dominated.</p>
<h4 id="innate-spellcasting">Innate Spellcasting</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Charisma 12.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier; spell attack bonus = proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier). It can innately cast spells, requiring no material components. </p>
<p>Pick a number of spells equal to the dragon turtle's Charisma modifier. Follow the table below to determine how often the spells can be cast. At Will spells can be cantrips, 1st level, or 2nd level spells. 3/Day spells should be at least 1st or 2nd level, and have a maximum level equal to the dragon turtle's Challenge Rating divided by 4 (rounded up). 1/Day spells should be the strongest spells in the dragon's arsenal. The highest level spell a dragon turtle can cast is equal to its Challenge Rating divided by 3 (rounded up).</p>

<p>If the dragon turtle has legendary actions, it also gains the following Legendary Action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Innate Casting (Costs 3 Actions).</em></strong> The dragon turtle casts a spell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The older the dragon turtle, the more likely they have spells that are outside the "core" spell list. Dragon turtles have no need of spellbooks, but can teach their chosen spells to any class that has the spell on its expanded spell list.</p>
<h4 id="large-and-in-charge">Large and In Charge</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: size Large or larger.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle can make opportunity attacks against creatures that enter its reach.</p>
<h4 id="limited-magic-immunity">Limited Magic Immunity</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Spell Resistance; must be Adult or Ancient.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle is immune to 1st level spells and cantrips, unless it wishes to be affected. A dragon turtle can take this feat multiple times, increasing its spell resistance by 1 level every time it takes the feat, to a maximum of 5th level spells.</p>
<h4 id="magic-resistance">Magic Resistance</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Arcane Immunity, Intelligence 15.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.</p>
<h4 id="magic-weaponry">Magic Weaponry</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Arcane Immunity.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle's weapon attacks are considered magical weapons for the purpose of overcoming resistances.</p>
<h4 id="maximize-breath">Maximize Breath</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Charisma 18.</em></p>
<p>When the dragon turtle uses its Breath Weapon, it can choose to expend all of its movement and Legendary Actions (if it has them) for that round. If it does, its Breath Weapon deals maximum damage. If the dragon uses its Breath Weapon in this way, it recharges on a 6 rather than on a 5-6. </p>
<h4 id="mundane-weapon-immunity">Mundane Weapon Immunity</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisites: Mundane Weapon Resistance, must be Ancient or older.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle gains immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</p>
<h4 id="mundane-weapon-resistance">Mundane Weapon Resistance</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisites: Arcane Immunity, must be Young or older.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.</p>
<h4 id="reflective-scales">Reflective Scales</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Limited Magic Immunity.</em></p>
<p>If the dragon turtle is targeted by a ranged spell attack to which it is immune, (including magic missile), roll a d6. On a 1-5, nothing happens, and the dragon turtle is unaffected. On a 6, the spell is reflected, treating the caster as the target and the dragon turtle as the caster as if the spell had originated from the dragon turtle.</p>
<h4 id="roar">Roar</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Huge or larger.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle gains the Roar action option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Roar (Rechage 5-6).</em></strong> The dragon turtle unleashes a powerful roar. Each creature within 100 feet of the dragon turtle that can hear it must make a Constitution saving throw (save DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Charisma modifier) or take 11 (3d6) thunder damage and be stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't stunned. Note that being underwater does not prevent this damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="scary">Scary</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must have Frightful Presence.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle has advantage on Intimidation checks, and it gains a +2 bonus to the save DC of its Frightful Presence.</p>
<h4 id="siege-monster">Siege Monster</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisites: size Huge or larger, Strength 25.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle deals double damage to objects and buildings.</p>
<h4 id="shape-breath">Shape Breath</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Charisma 15.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle can change the shape of its breath weapon to a line that is 5 feet wide and double its range.</p>
<h4 id="shockwave">Shockwave</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: size Large or larger.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle gains the Shockwave action option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Shockwave.</em></strong> The dragon turtle slams its tail down on a solid surface (or on water that is at least ten feet deep) to create a circular shockwave with a radius equal to 15 times the number of size categories the dragon turtle is above Medium. All creatures in that area, aside from the dragon turtle, must succeed on a Strength saving throw against the dragon turtle's Strength Check. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone; if the creature is concentrating, it also loses concentration. Being underwater does not prevent this damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the dragon turtle has legendary actions, it also gains the following Legendary Action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Shockwave (Costs 2 Actions).</em></strong> The dragon turtle makes a Shockwave attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="spell-resistance">Spell Resistance</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Magic Resistance.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle gains resistance to all damage from spells.</p>
<h4 id="swift">Swift</h4>
<p>Each of the dragon turtle's speeds increases by 25%.</p>
<h4 id="tail-sweep">Tail Sweep</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must have a Tail Attack.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle gains the Tail Sweep action option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Tail Sweep.</em></strong> The dragon turtle swings its tail in a cone (range of Tail attack), targeting all creatures in the cone. The dragon makes a single attack roll, and uses that roll for all creatures in the area (attack modifier and damage are equal to Tail attack). If a creature is hit and is at least one size category smaller than the dragon, it must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (creature's choice, save DC = 8 + the dragon's proficiency bonus + the dragon's Strength modifier) or be pushed 15 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone, in addition to taking damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the dragon has legendary actions, it also gains the following Legendary Action:</p>
<p><strong>Tail Sweep (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The dragon makes a tail sweep attack.</p>
<h4 id="tempest-breath">Tempest Breath</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisites: size Large or larger.</em></p>
<p>The dragon turtle can channel the force of a windstorm into its breath. Whenever the dragon turtle uses its Breath Weapon, each creature that fails the saving throw is also knocked prone, in addition to any other effects. The creature is also pushed away from the dragon turtle, and the distance pushed is determined by the dragon turtle's size. If the creature moves 10 feet or more before hitting a wall or other obstacle, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it traveled.</p>

<h4 id="terrifying-presence">Terrifying Presence</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must have Frightful Presence.</em></p>
<p>When the dragon turtle uses its Frightful Presence ability, creatures with immunity to being frightened have advantage instead, and creatures normally with advantage (or resistance) do not have advantage. Otherwise a creature has disadvantage on the initial saving throw.</p>
<h4 id="tough">Tough</h4>
<p>The dragon turtle gains a number of hitpoints equal to 2 times its number of hit dice. Whenever the dragon turtle gains hit dice (as a result of taking class levels or of aging), its hit point maximum increases by 2 for every hit die it gained.</p>
<h4 id="unstoppable">Unstoppable</h4>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Arcane Immunity.</em></p>
<p>If the dragon turtle is subjected to an effect that would inflict the restrained or stunned condition, it instead loses its next use (one action) of its legendary actions and its speed is reduced by half for the duration of the spell or effect. The loss of legendary actions is cumulative, but the loss of speed is not.</p>

<h2 id="dragon-turtle-wyrmling">Dragon Turtle Wyrmling</h2>
<p>Dragon turtle wyrmlings are tiny creatures fresh from the shell, and despite their shell and inherent strength, very vulnerable to the myriad of predators in the deep oceans where dragon turtles lay their eggs. Abandoned even before hatching by the parents, dragon turtle wyrmlings must learn to survive the moment they emerge. Feeling little kinship to their sibling eggs in the clutch, some will even turn cannibal during the first few moments of life. Most dragon turtle parents, however, choose locations that are rich in food sources, preferring shallower depths for their progeny, where more fish and other food sources can be found.</p>
<p>Periodically, wyrmlings will venture out onto beaches and other coastal areas, exploring life above the surface of the water, but only as a last resort.</p>

<h2 id="young-dragon-turtle">Young Dragon Turtle</h2>
<p>The young dragon turtle generally has only a few decades of life under its shell, and is often wandering the sea lanes, looking for a place to lair, close to both food and creatures to plunder of treasure, and fighting off other creatures that seek to deny the turtle any of those things (including its young life). Intelligent enough to understand the value of alliances and friends, young dragon turtles often look to create makeshift tribes around themselves, either as peers or as minions. Tortles are particularly seen as advantageous allies, as the obvious genetic connection between the two is attractive to both sides--many's the relationship of young dragon turtle to band of tortle wanderers turned into a symbiotic one, stretching across generations as the dragon turtle ages. Legends tell of the wyrmling dragon turtle rescued by a young tortle, raised within the tortle's care, then the tortle's children's care, until the dragon turtle was of such a size that the tortle family (and then later an entire tortle village) could call the massive shell of dragon turtle "home".</p>
<p>Periodically, a young dragon turtle will explore the surface, prowling along coasts and observing costal towns and cities, usually in pursuit of answers to several questions, such as "Are the things over there good to eat?" and "Are the things over there carrying much treasure?" Answers to these questions often define the dragon turtle's relationship to humanoids for the long stretches of its life to come--if the town or city is poorly defended, the dragon turtle often finds coastal areas attractive, and looks for lairs nearby so it can continue its predatory behaviors. If the town or city is well defended, however, the dragon turtle will often find the humanoids to be more work than they're worth, and look for lairs in deeper waters (and prey for treasure on larger ships along trade lines).</p>

<h2 id="ancient-dragon-turtle">Ancient Dragon Turtle</h2>
<p>Ancient dragon turtles are massive creatures, and their connection to the Elemental Plane of Water is strong; often they discover means by which to create the portals between the Material Plane and the Elemental Plane themselves, and will journey between both as whimsy takes them. Some will partner with marids, who will strap magnificent coral thrones to the backs of dragon turtles and ride them as mounts, at least until such time that the dragon turtle tires of the partnership. (Some marids believe they have bound the dragon turtle into service, and discover--often at great price--that no dragon is ever bound into service without its consent.)</p>
<p>Even as ancients, dragon turtles can still surprise the unwary. Legends tell, in fact, of the ancient dragon turtle that mastered the <a href="../../../Magic/Spells/fly/">fly</a> spell, and would spend days on end diving to the depths of the ocean, swim to the surface and breach (as whales do), casting <em>fly</em> as it did, and soaring into the sky--then falling back into the water from great heights, causing no end of damage and destruction along the coasts as the tsunami waves surged out from the impact.</p>

<h3 id="a-dragon-turtles-lair">A Dragon Turtle's Lair</h3>
<p>Dragon turtles dwell in caves hidden in coral reefs or beneath the seafloor, or along rugged stretches of coastline. A dragon turtle's lair is often a coastal cave, undersea cavern, or even ancient ruin or shipwreck that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is often littered with the bones of previous victims, watched over by crumbling statues. Octopi and squid (both normal and giant varieties) often lair with the dragon turtle, as will tortles, merfolk, or sahuagin.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon turtle takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon turtle can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="../../Quippers/#swarm-of-quippers">swarm of quippers</a> fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The quippers can either simply obscure vision through the cloud, or can be given commands and attack as directed by the dragon turtle. The swarm remains until destroyed or dismissed by the dragon turtle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dragon turtle creates fog as though it had cast the fog cloud spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon turtle can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a dragon turtle's lair is warped by the dragon’s magic.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once per day, the dragon turtle can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon turtle doesn't need to be outdoors or above the surface of the water; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon's lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within its lair, the dragon turtle can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon turtle dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.</p></div>
