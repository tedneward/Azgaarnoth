# Dragonspawn
The dragonspawn are an alchemical and magical experiment to stiffen the ranks of the chromatic dragons by the [Cult of the Wyrm](../Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md), among others. In essence, by taking a clutch of chromatic dragon eggs (most of which won't survive, owing to the predatory nature of chromatic dragon hatchlings) and bathing them in a particular alchemical stew accompanied by some twisted magic during their time in the egg, a half-dragon-like creature can emerge from the egg, ready almost immediately to wreak havoc on whatever happens to be nearby.

For whatever reasons, red dragon eggs seem immune to the treatment.

Unlike dragonborn, dragonspawn aren't always humanoid in nature--blackspawn emerge that way, but the rest take more to the animalistic nature of the dragon and are four-legged creatures.

## Blackspawn Raider
The blackspawn raider is a two-legged humanoid, heavily muscled but only about 3 feet tall, and vaguely reminiscient of lizardfolk or dragonborn. Any similarities are quickly dispelled up close--the coloration is entirely wrong for lizardfolk, and black dragonborn are definitely more humanoid in shape, nature, and carriage. Blackspawn raiders are nasty, crafty creatures that often prefer to work alone or with other creatures they can bully into submission; when encountered, they are chaotic, unpredictable, and often only held in check by threats of physical violence. They live to destroy, and are often found in small bands of dragonspawn that rove across the land, bringing their particular talents to bear on anything and anyone.

Blackspawn raiders typically fight from ambush, preferring water as a means of cover. They will often look to poison the water as well, splashing the toxic water at their targets in hopes of landing some in their prey's eyes and blinding them. They often look to nurture bluespawn thunderlizard packs as hunting pairs, and often dominate greenspawn razorfiends and use them as part of their ambushes, as well.

## Bluespawn Thunderlizard
The bluespawn thunderlizard is a four-legged wingless lizard with deep blue coloration along its back and sides, resembling bulky wingless blue dragons. They normally stand about 6ft tall at the shoulder, and tend to weigh around 2 tons. Its teeth are less pronounced than one might think, but the solitary horn coming from its head (reminiscient of a rhinoceros) very solid and tingly to the touch. 

Bluespawn thunderlizards prefer to live in warm, dry regions. They naturally formed packs of four or eight, with an equal number of males and females in each group. Not overly intelligent, the thunderlizards are often used by blackspawn raiders in the same manner as hunting dogs. They adamantly refuse anyone that seeks to ride them, however, and will fight to the death if any creature attempts to do so.

Bluespawn thunderlizards are naturally immune to electricity, and have been seen in the wild engaging in a form of playful behavior, passing electrical surges from one horn to another.

Bluespawn thunderlizards can reproduc on their own, with each egg having two hatchlings in it, always producing same-sex twins. The twins are inseparable from birth, and will grow listless and despondent if separated. If one twin dies, the other goes mad with rage and loss, and often goes on a mindless killing spree until it, too, dies.

Bluespawn thunderlizard pairs naturally seek out an opposite-sex pair for mating, but do not mate for life: within a pack, mates were known to change. The pairs use the same lair for their eggs, and twin fathers raise their sons together, and twin mothers raise their daughters together.

Bluespawn thunderlizards recognize other dragonspawn as kindred creatures and refuse to attack them. They can be domesticated if raised from the egg and trained as mounts, although the twins still cannot stand to leave sight of each other.

## Greenspawn Razorfiend
Greenspawn razorfiends are large creatures, standing 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and as much as 20 feet (6.1 meters) in length. On average, adults weigh 6,000 pounds (2,700 kilograms). Greenspawn razorfiend scales are a dirty green color that helped them blend in with forest pools. These dragonspawns' wings are useless for flight, but are razor-sharp and resemble knife blades when folded. They also aid the razorfiend's movement through water, giving them surprisingly good speed.

Greenspawn razorfiends are cunning hunters that enjoy the killing of prey as much as the hunt. They prefer to live in warm or temperate forests and marshes, and often hide in water or undergrowth before attacking. Like other dragonspawn, greenspawn razorfiends can mate on their own; once mated, they are mated for life, and take turns hunting and guarding the nest.

## Whitespawn Frostlizard
At 11 feet (3.4 meters) long and 2,000 pounds (910 kilograms), whitespawn iceskidders are easily the size of a horse, and can be ridden like one by braver creatures. They had vestigial wings that are used to help propel themselves, white scales, vaguely draconic features, and a modified tail that aids them when sliding across the ice. Barely more intelligent than animals, frostlizards are notoriously cruel, and often toy with their prey before consuming it. Like most dragonspawn, they enjoy striking from hiding, and will often burrow under the ice and snow to arrive directly under their prey before springing their ambush.

Whitespawn frostlizards are immune to the effects of cold, and retain a portion of their draconic breath weapon, which they often use to help shape lairs and cover themselves with snow or ice to aid in ambush. They are largely solitary, but mated pairs will live and hunt together, hibernating in their caves of snow and ice during warmer seasons.
