<h2 id="dracolich">Dracolich</h2>
<p>Even as long-lived as they are, all dragons must eventually die. This thought doesn't sit well with many dragons, some of which allow themselves to be transformed by necromantic energy and ancient rituals into powerful undead dracoliches. Only the most narcissistic dragons choose this path, knowing that by doing so, they sever all ties to their kin and the dragon gods.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beyond Death.</em></strong> A dracolich retains its shape and size upon transforming, its skin and scales drawing tight to its bones or sloughing away to leave a skeletal form behind. Its eyes appear as glowing points of light floating in shadowy sockets, hinting at the malevolence of its undead mind.</p>
<p>Though many dragons pursue vain goals of destruction and dominance, dracoliches are more nefarious than the most evil dragons, driven to rule over all. A dracolich is a fiendishly intelligent tyrant that crafts complex webs of foul schemes, attracting servants motivated by greed and a lust for power. Acting from the shadows and actively plotting to keep its existence a secret, a dracolich is a cunning and challenging foe.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dracolich Phylacteries.</em></strong> Creating a dracolich requires the cooperation of the dragon and a group of mages or cultists that can perform the proper ritual. During the ritual, the dragon consumes a toxic brew that slays it instantly. The attendant spellcasters then ensnare its spirit and transfer it to a special gemstone that functions like a lich's phylactery. As the dragon's flesh rots away, the spirit inside the gem returns to animate the dragon's bones.</p>
<p>If a dracolich's physical form is ever destroyed, its spirit returns to the gem as long as the two are on the same plane. If the gem comes into contact with another dragon's corpse, the dracolich's spirit can take possession of that corpse to become a new dracolich. If the dracolich's spirit gem is taken to another plane, the dracolich's spirit has nowhere to go when its undead body is destroyed and simply passes into the afterlife.</p>
<p><strong><em>Requirements.</em></strong> Only an ancient or adult true dragon can be transformed into a dracolich. Younger dragons that attempt to undergo the transformation die, as do other creatures that aren't true dragons but possess the dragon type, such as pseudodragons and wyverns. A shadow dragon can't be transformed into a dracolich, for it has already lost too much of its physical form.</p>
<p><strong><em>Transformation.</em></strong>
When a dragon becomes a dracolich, it retains its statistics except as described below. The dragon loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The dracolich might retain or lose any or all of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> The dracolich's type changes from dragon to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Damage Resistance.</strong> The dracolich has resistance to necrotic damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Damage Immunities.</strong> The dracolich has immunity to poison. It also retains any immunities it had prior to becoming a dracolich.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Condition Immunities.</strong> The dracolich can't be charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned. It also doesn't suffer from exhaustion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Magic Resistance.</strong> The dracolich has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="ghost">Ghost</h2>
<p><strong><em>Requirements.</em></strong> A ghost dragon is sometimes created when a powerful dragon is killed and its hoard looted, or when something of similar caliber happens to a living dragon. The dragon can only be laid to rest by setting right whatever wrong caused it to appear; in the former example, the hoard (or treasure of equivalent value) would have to be returned to the dragon's lair, at which point the dragon would sleep atop it and pass on to the afterlife with the entirety of the hoard. </p>
<p><strong><em>Transformation.</em></strong> When a dragon becomes a ghost dragon, it retains its statistics, except as described below. The dragon loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The dragon retains none of its lair actions, but retains all of its legendary actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> The dragon's type changes from dragon to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speed.</strong> The dragon retains all of its speeds, and can hover.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Damage Resistances.</strong> The dragon gains resistance to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Damage Immunities.</strong> The dragon gains immunity to cold, necrotic, and poison damage. It also retains any immunities that it had in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Condition Immunities.</strong> The dragon gains immunity to the charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, and restrained conditions. It also doesn't suffer from exhaustion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Special Abilities.</strong> The dragon loses all supernatural and spell-like abilities that it possessed in life, including its Breath Weapon. It retains its Frightful Presence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Damage Type.</strong> The dragon's Bite, Claw, Tail, and Wing attacks deal necrotic damage rather than the damage type they dealt before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new trait: <strong><em>Ethereal Sight.</em></strong> The dragon can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new trait: <strong><em>Incorporeal Movement.</em></strong> The dragon can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new trait: <strong><em>Rejuvenation.</em></strong> If the dragon is destroyed, it reappears in its lair 2d4 days later with all its hit points. The only way to completely be rid of the dragon is to determine the reason for its existence and resolve the issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new trait: <strong><em>Etherealness.</em></strong> The dragon enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="shadow">Shadow</h2>
<p>Shadow dragons are true dragons that were either born in the Shadowfell or transformed by years spent within its dismal confines. Some shadow dragons embrace the Shadowfell for its bleak landscapes and desolation. Others seek to return to the Material Plane, hungry to spread the darkness and evil of the Plane of Shadow.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dark Portals.</em></strong> Portals to the Shadowfell manifest in forlorn places and the deep gloom of subterranean caverns. The dragons that lair in such places often discover these portals and find themselves transported to a new realm. Ancient dragons that sleep in their lairs for months or years at a time might find themselves spirited away, never knowing that a portal has formed without their knowledge as they dream.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recast in Shadow.</em></strong> The transformation to a shadow dragon happens over a period of years, during which time a dragon's scales lose their luster and fade to a charcoal hue. Its leathery wings become translucent, its eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray. Shadow dragons find sunlight abhorrent, and they are weaker in bright light than they are in darkness. Darkness makes the dragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self.</p>
<p>The magical nature of dragons holds an attraction for the Shadowfell, which seems somehow to crave the might and majesty of these great reptiles. The Shadowfell also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, such that the longer a creature remains on the plane, the more it accepts the plane's malaise. As months and years pass for a dragon on the Shadowfell, it becomes aware of the transformation being wrought upon it, and yet can do nothing to prevent it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Back in the World.</em></strong> A shadow dragon is so suffused with the power of the Shadowfell that even a return to the Material Plane can't undo its transformation. Some shadow dragons attempt to lure other creatures from the mortal realm back to the Shadowfell to keep them company, at least until they tire of their guests and devour them. Others are happy to leave the Shadowfell behind forever, understanding that treasure and power are easier to come by in the Material Plane.</p>
<p><strong><em>Requirements.</em></strong> Only a true dragon can transform into a shadow dragon, and only if it is born in the Shadowfell or remains there for several years. A dracolich can't be turned into a shadow dragon, since it loses its draconic nature when it becomes undead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Transformation.</em></strong> When a dragon becomes a shadow dragon, it retains its statistics except as described below. The shadow dragon might retain or lose any or all of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Damage Resistances.</strong> The dragon has resistance to necrotic damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add skill proficiency: <strong>Stealth.</strong> The dragon's proficiency bonus is doubled for its Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add trait: <strong><em>Living Shadow.</em></strong> While in dim light or darkness, the dragon has resistance to damage that isn't force, psychic, or radiant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add trait: <strong><em>Shadow Stealth.</em></strong> While in dim light or darkness, the dragon can take the Hide action as a bonus action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add trait: <strong><em>Sunlight Sensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight, the dragon has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new Action: <strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> If the dragon deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage with its bite, change that damage type to necrotic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new Action: <strong><em>Shadow Breath.</em></strong> Any damage-dealing breath weapon possessed by the dragon deals necrotic damage instead of its original damage type. A humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, and an undead shadow rises from its corpse and acts immediately after the dragon in the initiative count. The shadow is under the dragon's control.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="skeletal">Skeletal</h2>
<p>Skeletal dragons are created through spells such as <a href="../Magic/Spells/animate-dead.md">animate dead</a>. Such a dragon has no memory of its former life or self, and functions identically to any other skeleton, though it retains some of its abilities and powers because of its draconic nature. </p>
<p><strong><em>Transformation.</em></strong> When a dragon becomes a skeletal dragon, it retains its statistics, except as described below. The dragon loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The dragon retains none of its lair actions or legendary actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> The dragon's type changes from dragon to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speed.</strong> The dragon loses its flying speed and its swimming speed, if it had one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Armor Class.</strong> Modify the dragon's Armor Class by applying a -4 penalty. Much of the dragon's protective armor has rotten or sloughed away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Damage Vulnerabilities.</strong> The dragon gains vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Damage Immunities.</strong> The dragon gains immunity to poison damage. It also retains all immunities that it had in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Condition Immunities.</strong> The dragon gains immunity to the poisoned condition, and retains any immunities it had in life. It also doesn't suffer from exhaustion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Special Abilities.</strong> The dragon loses all supernatural and spell-like abilities that it possessed in life, including its Breath Weapon. It retains its Frightful Presence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skills.</strong> The dragon loses all skill proficiencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dragon Feats.</strong> The dragon loses all feats that it had taken in life.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Zombie dragons are created through spells such as <a href="../Magic/Spells/animate-dead.md">animate dead</a>. Such a dragon has no memory of its former life or self, and functions identically to any other zombie, though it retains some of its abilities and powers because of its draconic nature.</p>
<p>When a dragon becomes a zombie dragon, it retains its statistics, except as described below. The dragon loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The dragon retains none of its lair actions or legendary actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> The dragon's type changes from Dragon to Undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Speed.</strong> All of the dragon's speeds are reduced by 10 feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Armor Class.</strong> Modify the dragon's Armor Class by applying a -2 penalty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Damage Immunities.</strong> The dragon gains immunity to poison damage. It also retains any immunities it had in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Condition Immunities.</strong> The dragon gains immunity to the poisoned condition and retains any immunities that it had in life. It also doesn't suffer from exhaustion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Special Abilities.</strong> The dragon loses all supernatural and spell-like abilities that it possessed in life, including its Breath Weapon. It retains its Frightful Presence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skills.</strong> The dragon loses all skill proficiencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dragon Feats.</strong> The dragon loses all feats that it had taken in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add new trait: <strong><em>Undead Fortitude.</em></strong> If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
