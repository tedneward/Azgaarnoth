<p>Iron dragons are good natured, but most forget this because they are often brutish, short-tempered, and pessimistic.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Most are driven by their need to be respected, and for some this translates to ruling through fear. They prefer their own company, like other dragons, but older iron dragons may have minions keep up their lairs or guard their hoards. Such minions are usually charmed with the dragon's Charming Breath, but occasionally frightened into service.</p>
<p>Iron dragons are master artificers and artists of craftsmanship, often using their hoard treasure to help them create new items. Much of their short-temper often stems from the interruptions that others bring to their work, and many is the tale of a would-be supplicant disturbing the iron dragon at a critical juncture in the manufacture of a truly beautiful piece of workmanship... and receiving the full dose of the dragon's breath weapon for doing so. They often are apologetic after the fact, but the older a iron dragon gets, the more their emphasis and focus is "the work".</p>
<p>However, if you are honest and up-front about your intentions, younger iron dragons can make excellent mercenaries and stalwart allies.</p>
<p>Iron dragons normally do not care for their metallic cousins of other varieties, and the others generally return the favor. Though they share the metallic hatred of the chromatics, irons are the most likely to tolerate sharing a border with a chromatic dragon. That is, unless the dragon is green. Iron and green dragons do not tolerate each other, as they usually inhabit similar areas, and the greens especially infuriate irons because the more literal irons are easily outsmarted by the conniving greens.</p>
<p>Iron dragons are solitary (aside from possible minions) and will not seek out other creatures, aside from other iron dragons when they feel the need to mate. They follow the mating rituals traditionally followed by metallic dragons, raising their young as a couple, but they rarely mate for life.</p>
<h2 id="terrain-and-habitat">Terrain and Habitat</h2>
<p>Iron dragons like places with plenty of cover large enough to hide a large predator; their favorite environments are rocky hills or dense forests. </p>
<p>They take particular care in hiding their lairs, which have a reputation for being among the most difficult dragon lairs to find. If the dragon cannot find a totally inaccessible place (like a cavern reachable only by flight) they will settle for the most difficult terrain and cover they can find. Common places to find iron dragon lairs include overgrown forest ravines or briar-choked gulches.</p>
<h2 id="lairs">Lairs</h2>
<p>An iron dragon's lair usually consists of several large chambers with many entrances and exits. Something hides the lair's main entrance, such as overgrown foliage or a large rock that the dragon can push out of the way.</p>
<h2 id="favored-treasure">Favored Treasure</h2>
<p>Iron dragons prefer martial treasures like armor and weapons, especially ones won from would-be challengers. They take these as trophies and as marks of their battle prowess. Aside from that, they love the look and feel of silver and gold coins.</p>
<h2 id="tactics">Tactics</h2>
<p>Iron dragons always strike from ambush. If engaging in their lair, they will distract enemies with carefully positioned traps (or minions if they have any), and then attack when their enemies are distracted. If they do not believe they can win a fight, they have no qualms with fleeing to save their own hide. </p>
<p>If they have minions, iron dragons most often "coerce" goblins, hobgoblins, minotaurs, or other evil creatures to work for them, reasoning that the efforts of such creatures are put to much better use toward the cause of good rather than furthering their otherwise evil ends. In such a situation, an iron dragon might leave such minions to die if it can save itself. It is for the greater good, after all.</p>
<h2 id="diet">Diet</h2>
<p>Iron dragons prefer midsized game such as deer and boar. Most will eat sentient creatures if the opportunity presents itself, but only if they are evil or obviously malicious. They especially prefer smaller humanoids that are less able to protect themselves, such as goblins or kobolds. Iron dragons keep from eating good creatures, but occasionally a particularly malignant specimen might build a lair along a hobgoblin highway or similar area so it can ambush unsuspecting (evil) passersby.</p>
<h2 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h2>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the <a href="">spike growth</a> spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A bright bolt of lightning strikes at that point. Each creature within 10 feet of the lightning strike takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage, and each creature within 20 feet of the lightning strike must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dragon creates a cloud of fog as if casting the <a href="">fog cloud</a> spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the
next round.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h2>
<p>The region containing a legendary iron dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thunderstorms are common within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
<li>Creatures that cannot normally speak Draconic have the ability to do so within 1 mile of the lair.</li>
<li>Reptiles are unusually active within 1 mile of the lair.</li>
</ul>

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the dragon fails a saving
throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Actions
Multiattack. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.
It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two
with its claws.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft.,
one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage.
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one
target. Hit: 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.
Frightful Presence. Each creature of the dragon's choice
that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it
must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or
become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence
for the next 24 hours.
Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6). The dragon uses one of
the following breath weapons.
Lightning Breath. The dragon exhales lightning in a 95-
foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC
24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 67 (15d8)
lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
Charming Breath. The dragon exhales gas in a 95-foot
cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a
DC 24 Constitution saving throw or be charmed by
the dragon for 1 minute. Each time the dragon or the
dragon's companions do anything harmful to the
creature, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the
effect on itself on a success.
Change Shape. The dragon magically polymorphs into a
humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no
higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts
to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing
or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the
dragon's choice).
In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit
points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies,
Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its
statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by
those of the new form, except any class features or
legendary actions of that form.
Legendary Actions
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing
from the options below. Only one legendary action
option can be used at a time and only at the end of
another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.
Detect. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception)
check.
Tail Attack. The dragon makes a tail attack.
Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its
wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon
must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw
or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be
knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half
its flying speed.</p>
