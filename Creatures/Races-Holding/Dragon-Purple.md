# Purple Dragon
Purple dragons are exceptionally rare among dragonkind because they reside only deep beneath the earth and in the delves of the Underdark. This has also given them the name of "deep dragons." Most surface-dwellers are ignorant or skeptical of their existence; anyone lucky (or unlucky) enough to see one usually passes it off as a black dragon that has made its lair far underground; in the dark, who's to say whether the scales are purple or black?

The deep dragons have a love for lies and manipulation rivaling even that of the greens. Its very gaze has the ability to charm a person into doing the will of the dragon. It might manipulate for a number of reasons: to explore a cavern or ruin, to form "allies" and bodyguards, or simply for fun. However, their love to explore trumps even their desire to manipulate (which is perhaps why the Greens are the more talented manipulators). Nothing warms the cold heart of a deep dragon like exploring deep caverns in the dark where no foot has trod before.

A purple dragon could possibly be bartered with, if the creatures have information or items relating to exploration that the dragon is interested in (that wouldn't directly benefit the dragon were it to dominate them instead). Purple dragons make staunch short-term allies, and have been known to ally with drow on many occasions.

## Tactics
Green dragons are more talented manipulators to be sure, but purples are the more talented dominators. A purple dragon prefers to attack from ambush, and even in these situations, prefers to send in its minions first. When the dragon does come out of hiding, it immediately attempts to dominate (or otherwise persuade) as many of its foes as possible before unleashing its fury of psychic attacks.

## Terrain and Habitat
Purple dragons love the deep darkness of the Underdark. They are rarely (if ever) seen above ground because direct sunlight harms them, and they make their homes deep beneath the surface where they are safe from the sun's rays. Some have been known to make their homes in the Shadowfell, for the same reasons. They also prefer the Underdark because, in their eyes, the surface is a boring place with nowhere to go or explore; the endless tunnels of the Underdark always go ever deeper, begging generations of purple dragons to delve and explore their depths.

## Diet
Deep dragons love food they can catch in underground seas and rivers. They will eat blind fish in enormous quantities, but love the occasional kua-toa. Aboleths are a special delicacy (assuming the dragon is strong enough to overcome such a foe).

## Lairs
The lair of a purple dragon is labyrinthine. It takes a special kind of explorer to keep from getting lost in one, but the dragon always remembers every nook and cranny. Many passages are dead ends that lead to traps.

The love of a purple dragon for exploration is such that one may leave its lair for extended amounts of time before returning. Many will dominate or beguile servants to guard their hoards, and older dragons may learn spells or seek out artifacts (such as scrolls or like rituals) that allow them to quickly return to their lairs, should the need arise.

## Envpurplemental Diffusion
When a purple dragon undergoes envpurplemental diffusion, the surrounding area is covered in small mushrooms. The area is also cursed such that any creature that tries to rest there is afflicted by nightmares and horrid thoughts, and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to gain the benefit of a full rest. The DC for this saving throw is equal to the dead dragon's Challenge Rating.

## Physical Characteristics
Purple dragons are lithe and sleek, with slender bodies, limbs, and heads, and narrow wings. This is to allow them to slip through caverns that might ordinarily not allow a creature of their size to fit through.

## Favored Treasure
A purple dragon, like all dragons, covets all kinds of treasure, but has a special love for maps and cartography tools, especially those enchanted with magic. They also prize items that allow them to withstand higher temperatures, which they encounter as they delve into the Underdark.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
* The dragon moves up to half of its movement speed without triggering opportunity attacks.
* A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
* A cloud of darkness with a 30-foot radius originates from a point of the dragon's choosing that the dragon can see. It functions as if cast with the [darkness]() spell.

## Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary purple dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
* Any creature that attempts to take a long rest within 1 mile of the lair is afflicted with nightmares, and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, that creature gains no benefit from the rest.
* Within 6 miles of the lair, navigation becomes more difficult in the labyrinthine tunnels. All creatures without proficiency in the Survival skill have disadvantage on ability checks to avoid becoming lost.
* Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Shadowfell, allowing creatures from that plane to dwell nearby.

If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

## Purple Dragon [Feats](DraconicFeats.md)
The following draconic feats can only be taken by purple dragons.

### Deep Dragon
The dragon has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in dim light or darkness.

### Dominating Gaze
*Prerequisite: must be Young Adult or older.*

The dragon gains a new action option:
* **Dominating Gaze.** The dragon stares into the eyes of a creature. That creature must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw (save DC = Frightful Presence save DC) or be dominated by the dragon as if by the [dominate monster]() spell. On a successful save, that creature cannot be affected by the dragon's Dominating Gaze again for the next 24 hours.

If the dragon has legendary actions, it also gains the following Legendary Action:
* **Dominating Gaze (Costs 3 Actions).** The dragon uses its Dominating Gaze.

### Eldritch Resistance
**Prerequisite: Arcane Immunity.**

The dragon has resistance to force damage. 

### Enhanced Hearing
The dragon has blindsight with a radius equal to half the radius of its darkvision. As an action, it can place its head against the ground to listen for vibrations. It then knows the exact location of every creature that is not completely silent within 150 feet, even through walls.

### Inscrutable
Wisdom (Perception or Insight) checks made to ascertain the dragon's intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.

### Labyrinthine Recall
The dragon can perfectly recall any path it has traveled.

### Lithe Form
The dragon counts as one size smaller when determining a space it could fit through without squeezing.

### Psychic Superiority
*Prerequisite: Inscrutable.*

If the dragon is subjected to an effect that would inflict the charmed, dominated, frightened, or stunned condition, or psychic damage, or is the subject of a divination spell, mindreading, or similar effect, the dragon has advantage on the saving throw against the effect. If the spell offers no saving throw, the dragon can attempt an Intelligence saving throw against the caster's spell save DC. If the dragon succeeds, the creature of origin takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage.

### Underdark Explorer
*Prerequisite: Deep Dragon, Labyrinthine Recall.*

The dragon has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to navigate underground.
