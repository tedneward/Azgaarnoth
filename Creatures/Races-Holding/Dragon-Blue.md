# Creature: Blue Dragon
Of all the chromatic dragons, blue dragons (also called storm dragons) are the most vain and arrogant. They love wielding their tremendous power and ruling over humanoids or creatures alike, but not for practical means or results; they only want to prove that they can do so. Blue dragons are one of the few dragons that can forgive insult, but if one dares to insinuate that the dragon is weak or inferior, they had better brace themselves for the torrential wrath that is the dragon's. They are particularly territorial and are prone to attacking intruders, but are willing to listen to whatever excuses the creature has in store (especially if such excuses involve flattering the dragon).

If given the proper respect it believes it deserves, blue dragons can be reasonable. They have been known to be peaceful neighbors with humanoid kingdoms or even other chromatic dragons, simply because the other party respects the dragon's pride and territorial conditions. They may even take an opportunity to employ humanoids, as they love the display of power, and the feeling of accomplishment without having to do anything.

## Diet
Blue dragons prefer large prey such as cattle, and they like having only a few very large meals as opposed to several small ones. They do not purposefully hunt sentient life, as black dragons might, but if a blue dragon is hungry and has the opportunity, it will not pass it up. For whatever reason, they like their meat fresh and slightly charred, but not cooked through. In other words: freshly killed with lightning.

## Tactics
Blues consider combat a long-term engagement that can take several minutes or hours, depending on the strength of the adversary. Of all dragons, they are the most likely to attack opponents bigger and stronger than themselves for their pride's sake. Because of this, they prefer long-range attacks while flying during battle. They will unleash barrages of lightning for hours without coming down.

## Terrain and Habitat
Blue dragons like to live anywhere stormy, but especially along the ocean or particularly stormy isles. They may also live along thunderous mountain ridges or seaside cliffs, or even a rainforest. If a blue dragon cannot find such a place, it may settle wherever it is; that is, anyplace except arctic terrain. However, in the dragon's eyes, these lairs are always temporary, because a blue dragon longs to hear thunder and fly through clouds strewn with lightning.

## Lairs
Blue dragons like to make their lairs at the tops of peaks where they can survey their territory and be one with a storm as it rolls through. They favor enormous stone ruins or caves in the sides of mountains, cliffs, or hills. If they can help it, they prefer ruins the most, which probably has something to do with their pride. If for some reason they cannot lair at the peak or near it, they still make their lairs accessible only by flight, so would-be intruders must suffer through painstaking, and sometimes impossible, climbs.

## Favored Treasure
Blue dragons like treasure that is as pretty to look at as it is valuable. Particularly they love gems, especially blue ones, but they also have a love for art and jewelry. Rarely, a blue dragon actually leaves some treasure behind because the dragon felt that it was unattractive, and therefore would detract from the greatness of the hoard and, by extension, of the dragon itself.

## Physical Characteristics
The scales of a blue dragon are more reflective than those of the other chromatic dragons. They cannot be used as mirrors, but when in blue or dark environments (such as the sky during the day or night, respectively), their scales take on the associated color and allow them to blend in. The enormous prominent horn on its nose, in addition to being an effective bashing weapon, is practically used in conjunction with its brow as a rain funnel to keep precipitation out of its eyes. This gives it enhanced vision during storms. They might smell of ozone, but the smell is easily masked by wind or inclement weather.

## Environmental Diffusion
A blue dragon that undergoes Environmental Diffusion creates a permanent storm in the vicinity, even underground. The severity of the storm may rise or fall, but the storm itself never dies completely, regardless of the weather happening around or outside of it.

## Blue Dragon [Feats](DraconicFeats.md)
The following feats can only be taken by blue dragons.

### Lightning Aura
*Prerequisite: must be Juvenile or older.*

Each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the dragon or moves there for the first time on its turn takes 5 (1d10) lightning damage.

### Lightning Marksman
Whenever the dragon uses its Lightning Breath, it can double the breath's range. If the breath is modified in this way, it deals half of its usual damage.

### Horn Attack
*Prerequisite: must have Multiattack.*

When the dragon uses its Multiattack action option, instead of making a Bite attack, the dragon can make a Horn attack.

**Horn.** Melee Weapon Attack: bonus to hit and reach are equal to Bite attack, one target. Hit: (1d12 + Strength modifier) bludgeoning damage, plus an additional 6 (1d12) damage for each size category the dragon is above Medium. If the dragon is Huge or larger, the target must make a Constitution saving throw (save DC = 8 + the dragon's proficiency bonus + the dragon's Strength modifier) or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

### Primeval Lightning
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

The dragon's attacks ignore resistance to lightning damage. When the dragon rolls lightning damage, it can treat any 1 rolled on a damage die as a 2. In addition, a creature in metal armor has disadvantage on saving throws to evade the dragon's Breath Weapon.

### Sky Camouflage
The dragon can use the Hide action when it is flying at a higher altitude than those it is hiding from, even if there is nowhere to hide.

### Sound Imitation
*Prerequisite: must be Juvenile or older.*

The dragon can mimic any sound or voice that it has heard, any time it likes. To discern the ruse, a creature can attempt a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the dragon's Charisma (Deception) check. If the creature wins the contest, it learns that the sound is false, but doesn't learn its source.

### Storm Dragon
The dragon can fly normally even in storm-strength winds. In addition, its vision is not obscured by precipitation, and it ignores cover granted by rain. The dragon also gains
resistance to thunder damage.

### Stunning Lightning
*Prerequisite: Primeval Lightning.*

A creature who fails its saving throw against the dragon's Breath Weapon is also stunned until the end of the dragon's next turn.

### Thunder Breath
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

The dragon gains the following action option:

**Thunder Breath (1/Day).** The dragon calls upon the powers of the storm to unleash a monstrous roar that shakes the foundations of the world. All creatures within the range must make a Constitution saving throw (save DC = Lightning Breath save DC), taking thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature who fails the save is also stunned until the end of its next turn. 

The range and damage are given in the following table. 

**Thunder Breath**
Dragon Age|Range (radius)|Damage
----------|--------------|------
Mature Adult|80 ft|77 (14d10)
Old |100 ft|88 (16d10)
Elder |120 ft|93 (17d10)
Ancient |140 ft|99 (18d10)
Wyrm |170 ft|104 (19d10)
Great Wyrm |200 ft|110 (20d10)

### Veil
*Prerequisite: must be Ancient or older.*

The dragon gains the following action option:

**Veil (1/Day).** The dragon casts seeming, but it can target each creature within its lair that it is aware of. The dragon can perfectly replicate specific creatures and objects that it has seen. The effects are otherwise identical to the spell's description.

### Ventriloquism
*Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.*

The dragon can "throw‚Äù its voice (or any other sound it makes) to make it sound like it is coming from a point or creature of its choice that it can see within 120 feet of it. A creature who succeeds on a Wisdom (Insight) check against the dragon's Charisma (Deception) check recognizes it as illusory, but doesn't discern the sound's true source.
