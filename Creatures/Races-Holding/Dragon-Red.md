# Creature: Red Dragon
Though all dragons are greedy, red dragons take that greed to the next level. No amount of treasure is enough for a red, and they believe that treasure is for the strongest to take, which most of the time happens to be them. Red dragons epitomize the iconic image of a fire-breathing dragon, and they themselves believe that they are the pinnacle of draconic, and therefore of all, creation.

They never forgive, and punish even the smallest of sins with death: crossing territory boundaries, taking a single coin from a hoard, or because they think you look ugly. Never insult a red. Blues may be forgiving, but a red dragon will never forget, and if you manage to somehow escape the inferno that is its wrath, it will go on a rampage and demolish everything it sees.

Reds are cunning strategists, however, and not mindlessly violent. A red will develop tactics beforehand for every imaginable scenario. Even so, they know when they are outmatched and, though it hurts their pride to do so, they will back down from a fight they know they cannot win.

Any humanoid settlements on the borders of a red dragon's territory can stave its wrath by offering vast sums of wealth or young adults, upon which it feasts. Whereas reds control through deception and intrigue, reds control through demanding power and slaughtering all who do not obey.

## Diet
Reds love raw untainted meat more than anything, and in the absence of meat some will starve themselves for days before consuming plants or inorganic material. They particularly have a love for tender meat from young animals, especially young adult humanoids.

## Tactics
Legends of red dragons portray them as powerful creatures (which they are) who destroy senselessly and attack without deliberation. This is false. Red dragons are clever and calculating in their every move. In their hundreds and thousands of years, they have had plenty of time to think through every possible scenario and prepare accordingly. A red dragon will use terrain to its advantage, and if in the open, will keep out of range while blasting with its fire breath. Parts of its lair may be made specifically for killing would-be vanquishers, and positioned so that by the time they realize, it is far too late.

## Terrain and Habitat
A red dragon prefers, above all other options, to live someplace elevated with a hot climate, such as a volcano or a sulfurous geyser, but it would be quite happy to lair anywhere high, where it can survey its territory. This includes mountain peaks, rocky badlands, and desert mesas. Reds loathe cold and will avoid arctic climates if they can, but will sometimes make their homes atop snowcapped peaks for the elevation.

## Lairs
Red dragons like cavernous caves or cave complexes within the earth. These rarely occur naturally (especially at high elevations), so usually a Red Dragon will overtake someplace built by another race, or enslave creatures to build or modify a lair for it.

## Favored Treasure
No pattern of favored treasure has emerged among reds, only this: they covet everything in their hoard, everything in every other dragon's hoard, and anything that anyone owns that might be of any value. They are by far the greediest of dragons (which is saying something) and do not care what form their treasure takes, so long as they have it.

## Environmental Diffusion
A red dragon's Environmental Diffusion can take one of two forms, depending on the environment. In a mountainous or rocky area, the area splits open to reveal volcanic activity or sulfuric geysers that emit foul-smelling and acrid smoke, even when not active. In less stony and more flammable areas, a permanent wildfire erupts in the area and never goes out regardless of weather or fuel, always staying within the boundaries of the area.

## Physical Characteristics
Red dragons have no qualms with their inability to camouflage; as far as they are concerned, they do not need it, and they appreciate the fear that their appearance strikes into the hearts of lesser beings. Their wings are vast in comparison to their bodies. They smell of smoke and sulphur, and the air around them shimmers as if seen through a heat mirage.

## Red Dragon [Feats](DraconicFeats.md)
The following feats can only be taken by red dragons.

### Appraise
The dragon automatically knows the exact value of something only by looking at it.

### Death Throes
When the dragon dies, a final blast of fire marks its demise. Each creature within 30 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw (save DC = Fire Breath save DC), taking fire damage equal to the damage dealt by its Fire Breath on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried.

### Discern Location
*Prerequisite: must be Ancient or older.*

The dragon gains the following action option:

**Discern Location (3/Day).** The dragon can immediately learn the exact location of any item it has touched or any creature it has seen (or has a belonging of), as long as the two are on the same plane of existence. Nothing will block this ability other than a wish, a mind blank spell, or the intervention of deity.

### Exceptional Hearing
The dragon's blindsight radius increases by 50%.

### Fire Aura
*Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.*

Each creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of the dragon or moves into that area for the first time on its turn takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.

### Ignite
When a creature or flammable object takes fire damage from the dragon's breath weapon, it ignites. An ignited target takes 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turn, cannot take reactions, and has disadvantage on attack rolls until it or another creature uses an action to extinguish the flames.

### Overheat
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

The dragon's temperature evaporates ice in its immediate vicinity, including such effects from magic or spells. As a result, the dragon is resistant to cold damage.

### Scorching Flames
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

The dragon's attacks ignore resistance to fire damage. When the dragon rolls fire damage, it can treat any 1 rolled on a damage die as a 2.

### Smokescreen
The dragon gains the following Breath Weapon option:

**Smokescreen.** The dragon exhales a cloud of black smoke, with the same range and shape as its Fire Breath. The smoke spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. All creatures in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (save DC = Fire Breath save DC) or be blinded for one minute. A creature can attempt the saving throw again at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Additionally, a creature that starts its turn in the smoke or enters that area for the first time on its turn takes 7 (2d6) fire damage, and must make a Constitution saving throw (same DC as above). On a failed save, the creature's speed is reduced by half, and it spends its action that turn choking as the smoke overwhelms its lungs. Creatures that do not need to breathe air automatically succeed the save.

The smoke lasts until the dragon uses its Breath Weapon again or until it is cleared with a strong wind. The dragon is immune to all of these effects.

### Torch
*Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.*

When the dragon uses its Fire Breath, the Breath Weapon's area becomes engulfed in flames for 3 (1d6) rounds. If a creature starts its turn in the engulfed area or enters the area for the first time on its turn, it takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.
