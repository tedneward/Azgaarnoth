<h1 id="creature-mithral-dragon">Creature: Mithral Dragon</h1>
<p>Mithral dragons are the most powerful of the metallic dragons (though golds are loath to acknowledge the mithrals' superiority). They have an uncanny ability to sense the future, and often experience visions of events that are to come; often these visions come as a result of their studying and pondering, as they usually offer their services to deities, religious causes, or other great endeavours.</p>
<p>As natives of the Astral Sea, mithral dragons are rarely seen on the Material Plane, unless something specific has driven them there. This always has something to do with the cause to which the dragon has devoted itself, and it usually disappears as soon as its purpose is finished. Ancient mithral dragons are said to guard religious sites of primeval origin on the Material Plane. No one knows the contents of these sites, and no one has had the courage to find out.</p>
<p>Most often, a mithral dragon will devote itself to Bahamut and offer its services to him, but other more unorthodox (they prefer the term "enlightened") dragons will devote themselves to Io, the god from which Bahamut and Tiamat were created. These dragons can be more unpredictable, and their alignments can shift toward neutral or even evil.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Because of their extraplanar origin, mithral dragons are immortal. They age as a normal dragon, but they cannot die of old age and they never reach the Twilight stage of a normal dragon's development. As a result, mithrals have been known to reach tens of thousands of years old. By that time, the dragon has likely attracted the attention of lesser gods, who then gauge if the dragon is a threat to their existence and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Mithral dragons only speak when they believe what they have to say is of vast importance. Even when they do speak, they don't think that tiny mortal minds can comprehend the vastness of their calling or the importance of their mission (no matter what their mission happens to be), so their speech tends to be condescending, though not in an overtly insulting manner.</p>
<h2 id="terrain-and-lairs">Terrain and Lairs</h2>
<p>Mithral dragons prefer their home plane, living in the domains of deities. While in these places, they maintain their loyalty to any deities they serve, no matter whose domain they happen to live in. If an "enlightened" mithral dragon can do so, it will try to find places that retain a remnant of Io's influence so that it can attune to the dead god's will and exact it. Mithral dragons will lie in wait for centuries or millenia waiting to hear the call of a deity or cause to which they are willing to pledge themselves; when the call comes, the dragon responds with exactness and determination. Trying to talk a mithral dragon out of its cause is like trying to teach a manticore table manners. But the manticore won't burn you to a crisp with its breath weapon.</p>
<p>On the Material Plane, mithral dragons don't favor any particular terrain. That said, if a mithral dragon does make a lair on the Material Plane, it will try to find a place where it can attune to the will of deity, which usually happens best in abandoned temples or other important religious areas. If one of these areas cannot be found, the dragon may settle for a mine where it can attempt to read gemstone deposits, and there glean glimpses of future events.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
* The dragon can choose any number creatures that it can see that are within 60 feet of it. Each of those creatures must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw as a beam of radiance shoots toward it, taking 5 (1d10) radiant damage on a failed save.
* The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next round.
* The dragon's scales reflect an intense otherworldly light in a 30-foot radius around it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary mithral dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
* The area for 6 miles around the dragon's lair turns into a lush paradise, even if it lives in a place where plants don't normally grow.
* Within 1 mile of the lair, beasts with 4 Intelligence or less and that are not hostile to the dragon become the dragon's zealous guards and spies. They alert the dragon to threats, and defend the dragon with their lives.
* Whenever a creature with at least 5 Intelligence finishes a long rest within 1 mile of the lair, it must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it involuntarily glimpses the future in the form of a short vision. The DM determines the content and nature of this vision. </p>
<p>When the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days. Plants remain where they have grown, unless they don't normally grow in that terrain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Frozen in Time</strong> 
A mithral dragon's secondary breath weapon freezes its opponents in time, almost as if with a <a href="../Magic/Spells/time-stop.md">time stop</a> spell. While a creature is thus affected, it suffers these conditions:
* the creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings
* attack rolls against the creature have advantage any melee weapon attack that would hit the creature is automatically a critical hit
* the creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="physical-characteristics">Physical Characteristics</h2>
<p>A mithral dragon's scales are snow white when it first hatches, and darken to silvery mithral as it ages; older dragons retain some snowy color in the form of intricate white striations that follow their musculature. Their scales glow faintly.</p>
<p>The long spikes on a mithral dragon's head appear to form a sort of crown, and smaller spines work their way down its neck, across its back, and all the way down its tail. These spikes stand on end whenever the dragon is excited, and especially when it is angered.</p>
<p>Mithral dragons are extremely muscular, and their scales follow the lines of their musculature, which makes their muscles pop even further.</p>
<p>An older mithral dragon's wings sometimes appear to be made of raw radiant energy rather than flesh.</p>
<h2 id="favored-treasure">Favored Treasure</h2>
<p>Mithral dragons only take treasure that furthers their goals. Therefore, it won't have a traditional dragon hoard unless having a vast sum of wealth somehow helps it to achieve whatever it is trying to achieve.</p>
<h2 id="diet">Diet</h2>
<p>Because they are originally from the Astral Sea where hunting can be extraordinarily difficult, mithral dragons have developed such that they require very little food. They are omnivorous, and often have servants tend gardens and/or flocks for them rather than hunt, because this gives the dragon more time to stay within its lair and ponder on its visions.</p>
<h2 id="tactics">Tactics</h2>
<p>Mithral dragons only fight when and where they want to. If a dragon isn't looking for a fight and is attacked, it will attempt to halt its attackers with its Time Stop Breath and flee. That is, unless its attackers are directly trying to oppose the dragon's goals or its cause, in which case the dragon counterattacks fiercely and without mercy. However, even in these situations, the dragon will only attack if it is advantageous for it to do so.</p>
<p>If the dragon does fight, it will choose an area with lots of obstructions and difficult terrain, so that it can most effectively utilize its teleportation ability. It uses its foresight to determine the most powerful foes and target them first, using its Time Stop Breath or teleportation to get into advantageous positions. A mithral dragon then prefers to spread its attacks across all of its foes, rather than focus down a single one, (especially if the dragon has the Dimension Strike dragon feat).</p>

<h3 id="blinding-breath">Blinding Breath</h3>
<p>A creature that fails its saving throw against the dragon's breath weapon is also blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
<h3 id="dimension-strike">Dimension Strike</h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must have Multiattack.</em></p>
<p>As a part of its Multiattack, the dragon can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that it can see. It has advantage on the first melee weapon attack it makes after teleporting.</p>
<h3 id="mithral-prescience">Mithral Prescience</h3>
<p>The dragon can use a bonus action to designate a creature within 50 feet of it. This creature takes a -2 penalty to AC against all of the dragon's melee attacks until the dragon is incapacitated or until the dragon designates a new creature.</p>
<h3 id="portent">Portent</h3>
<p>The dragon gains glimpses of the future. When it finishes a long rest, roll three d20s and record the numbers rolled. The dragon can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by itself or a creature that it can see with one of these foretelling rolls. It must choose to do so before the roll, and it can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. </p>
<p>Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When it finishes a long rest, the dragon loses any unused foretelling rolls.</p>
<h3 id="prophet">Prophet</h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Prophetic Defense; must be Ancient or older.</em></p>
<p>The dragon has advantage on all saving throws.</p>
<h3 id="prophetic-defense">Prophetic Defense</h3>

<p><strong>Prophetic Defense.</strong> When the dragon is hit by an attack, it gains a +3 bonus to its AC against that attack. If the attack misses, the dragon can then teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that it can see.</p>
<h3 id="radiant-teleportation">Radiant Teleportation</h3>
<p>When the dragon uses its Teleport action, the space it previously occupied explodes with bright radiant energy. Each creature within 20 feet of that space must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (save DC = Breath Weapon save DC) or take 18 (4d8) radiant damage. If the save fails by 5 or more, the creature is also blinded until the end of its next turn.</p>
<h3 id="time-stop">Time Stop</h3>
<p><em>Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.</em></p>
<p>The dragon gains the following action option:</p>
<p><strong>Time Stop (1/Day).</strong> The dragon innately casts the spell <a href="">time stop</a> without expending a spell slot or any innate casting uses.</p>

The creature also automatically fails Strength and
Dexterity saving throws. An affected creature can
attempt the save again at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect
ends early if the creature takes damage or is
otherwise interacted with in any way.
Change Shape. The dragon magically polymorphs into a
humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no
higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts
to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing
or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the
dragon's choice).
In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit
points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies,
Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its
statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by
those of the new form, except any class features or
legendary actions of that form.
Legendary Actions
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing
from the options below. Only one legendary action
option can be used at a time and only at the end of
another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.
Detect. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception)
check.
Tail Attack. The dragon makes a tail attack.
Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its
wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon
must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw
or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be
knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half
its flying speed.</p>
