<h1 id="purple-dragon">Purple Dragon</h1>
<p>Purple dragons are exceptionally rare among dragonkind because they reside only deep beneath the earth and in the delves of the Underdark. This has also given them the name of "deep dragons." Most surface-dwellers are ignorant or skeptical of their existence; anyone lucky (or unlucky) enough to see one usually passes it off as a black dragon that has made its lair far underground; in the dark, who's to say whether the scales are purple or black?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The deep dragons have a love for lies and manipulation rivaling even that of the greens. Its very gaze has the ability to charm a person into doing the will of the dragon. It might manipulate for a number of reasons: to explore a cavern or ruin, to form "allies" and bodyguards, or simply for fun. However, their love to explore trumps even their desire to manipulate (which is perhaps why the Greens are the more talented manipulators). Nothing warms the cold heart of a deep dragon like exploring deep caverns in the dark where no foot has trod before.</p>
<p>A purple dragon could possibly be bartered with, if the creatures have information or items relating to exploration that the dragon is interested in (that wouldn't directly benefit the dragon were it to dominate them instead). Purple dragons make staunch short-term allies, and have been known to ally with drow on many occasions.</p>
<h2 id="tactics">Tactics</h2>
<p>Green dragons are more talented manipulators to be sure, but purples are the more talented dominators. A purple dragon prefers to attack from ambush, and even in these situations, prefers to send in its minions first. When the dragon does come out of hiding, it immediately attempts to dominate (or otherwise persuade) as many of its foes as possible before unleashing its fury of psychic attacks.</p>
<h2 id="terrain-and-habitat">Terrain and Habitat</h2>
<p>Purple dragons love the deep darkness of the Underdark. They are rarely (if ever) seen above ground because direct sunlight harms them, and they make their homes deep beneath the surface where they are safe from the sun's rays. Some have been known to make their homes in the Shadowfell, for the same reasons. They also prefer the Underdark because, in their eyes, the surface is a boring place with nowhere to go or explore; the endless tunnels of the Underdark always go ever deeper, begging generations of purple dragons to delve and explore their depths.</p>
<h2 id="diet">Diet</h2>
<p>Deep dragons love food they can catch in underground seas and rivers. They will eat blind fish in enormous quantities, but love the occasional kua-toa. Aboleths are a special delicacy (assuming the dragon is strong enough to overcome such a foe).</p>
<h2 id="lairs">Lairs</h2>
<p>The lair of a purple dragon is labyrinthine. It takes a special kind of explorer to keep from getting lost in one, but the dragon always remembers every nook and cranny. Many passages are dead ends that lead to traps.</p>
<p>The love of a purple dragon for exploration is such that one may leave its lair for extended amounts of time before returning. Many will dominate or beguile servants to guard their hoards, and older dragons may learn spells or seek out artifacts (such as scrolls or like rituals) that allow them to quickly return to their lairs, should the need arise.</p>
<h2 id="envpurplemental-diffusion">Envpurplemental Diffusion</h2>
<p>When a purple dragon undergoes envpurplemental diffusion, the surrounding area is covered in small mushrooms. The area is also cursed such that any creature that tries to rest there is afflicted by nightmares and horrid thoughts, and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to gain the benefit of a full rest. The DC for this saving throw is equal to the dead dragon's Challenge Rating.</p>
<h2 id="physical-characteristics">Physical Characteristics</h2>
<p>Purple dragons are lithe and sleek, with slender bodies, limbs, and heads, and narrow wings. This is to allow them to slip through caverns that might ordinarily not allow a creature of their size to fit through.</p>
<h2 id="favored-treasure">Favored Treasure</h2>
<p>A purple dragon, like all dragons, covets all kinds of treasure, but has a special love for maps and cartography tools, especially those enchanted with magic. They also prize items that allow them to withstand higher temperatures, which they encounter as they delve into the Underdark.</p>
<h2 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h2>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
* The dragon moves up to half of its movement speed without triggering opportunity attacks.
* A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
* A cloud of darkness with a 30-foot radius originates from a point of the dragon's choosing that the dragon can see. It functions as if cast with the <a href="">darkness</a> spell.</p>
<h2 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h2>
<p>The region containing a legendary purple dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
* Any creature that attempts to take a long rest within 1 mile of the lair is afflicted with nightmares, and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, that creature gains no benefit from the rest.
* Within 6 miles of the lair, navigation becomes more difficult in the labyrinthine tunnels. All creatures without proficiency in the Survival skill have disadvantage on ability checks to avoid becoming lost.
* Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Shadowfell, allowing creatures from that plane to dwell nearby.</p>
<p>If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.</p>

<p>The following draconic feats can only be taken by purple dragons.</p>

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
Psychic Breath (Recharge 5-6). The dragon exhales a psychic shockwave in a 100-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 67 (19d6) psychic damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't stunned.
Legendary Actions
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
Detect. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
Tail Attack. The dragon makes a tail attack.
Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</p></div>
