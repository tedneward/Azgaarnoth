# Gnolls
Gnolls are feral humanoids that attack settlements along the frontiers and borderlands of civilization without warning, slaughtering their victims and devouring their flesh.

***Hordish Background.*** Gnoll packs were a large part of the Hordes that battled against the Eldar from the earliest days of Azgaarnoth's history; since that time, most have continued their tribal, nomadic ways, generally moving southward and now making up a significant percentage of the Ulmhorde. Some tribes chose to seek a more permanent existence within the more "civilized" Hordes, and many gnolls found themselves finding peace within Yithi and Zhi. Other tribes keep to their nomadic background but seek less to pillage and more to trade. Those gnolls who have "civilized" tend to worship any of the other gods *except* Yeenoghu.

***Demonic Origin.*** The origin of the gnolls traces back to the coming of the Hordes, but gnoll shamans tell of a time when the demon lord Yeenoghu found his way to the Material Plane and ran amok. Packs of ordinary hyenas followed in his wake, scavenging the demon lord's kills. Those hyenas were transformed into the first gnolls, parading after Yeenoghu until he was banished back to the Abyss. The gnolls then scattered across the face of the world, a dire reminder of demonic power.

***Nomadic Destroyers.*** Gnolls are dangerous because they strike at random. They emerge from the wilderness, plunder and slaughter, then move elsewhere. They attack like a plague of locusts, pillaging settlements and leaving little behind but razed buildings, gnawed corpses, and befouled land. Gnolls choose easy targets for their raids. Armored warriors holed up in a fortified castle will survive a rampaging gnoll horde unscathed, even as the towns, villages, and farms that surround the castle are ablaze, their people slaughtered and devoured.

Gnolls rarely build permanent structures or craft anything of lasting value. They don't make weapons or armor, but scavenge such items from the corpses of their fallen victims, stringing ears, teeth, scalps, and other trophies from their foes onto their patchwork armor. Some gnolls will move into cities, but often their personal hygiene habits clash with those of a city, and as a result most will reside either just outside the city walls in tents or huts, or in the worst parts of town. In fact, more than once a gnoll tribe has moved into the slums of a large city and essentially traded the plunder-and-slaughter of wilderness life for the muted-but-more-rewarding lesser-levels-of-plunder-and-slaughter they can get away with in the Slums. However, should two gnoll tribes encouter each other in the same slums district, they will immediately break out into open conflict until one tribe has defeated and absorbed the other.

***Thirst for Blood.***. No goodness or compassion resides in the heart of a gnoll. Like a demon, it lacks anything resembling a conscience, and can't be taught or coerced to put aside its destructive tendencies. The gnolls' frenzied bloodlust makes them an enemy to all, and when they lack a common foe, they fight among themselves. Even the most savage orcs avoid allying with gnolls.

***Monstrous Gnoll Feats.*** For those gnolls which are favored by Yeenoghu enough to survive to the appropriate levels, a number of gnoll-specific [feats](../Classes/Feats.md) are available.

***Playable Race: Incomparable Companions.*** Within the last millenium, tribes of gnolls have begun to change their ways, leaving some to wonder if the influence Yeenoghu exerted upon them has begun to wane. While exceptions exist, most gnolls continue to show their traditional ways, and when coming upon a gnoll in the wild, travelers are strongly suggested to keep weapons close at hand. Gnolls can be a [playable race](../Races/Gnoll.md).

## Gnoll Pack Lord
The alpha of a gnoll pack is the pack lord, ruling by might and cunning. A pack lord earns the best of a gnoll pack's spoils, food, valuable trinkets, and magic items. It ornaments its body with brutal piercings and grotesque trophies, dyeing its fur with demonic sigils, hoping Yeenoghu will make it invulnerable.

## Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu
Gnolls celebrate their victories by performing demonic rituals and making blood offerings to Yeenoghu. Sometimes the demon lord rewards his worshipers by allowing one of them to be possessed by a demonic spirit. Marked as Yeenoghu's favorite, the lucky recipient becomes a fang of Yeenoghu, the chosen of the Gnoll Lord. In much the same way Yeenoghu created the first gnolls, a hyena that feasts on a fang's slain foe undergoes a horrible transformation, becoming a full-grown adult gnoll. Depending on the number of hyenas in a region, a fang of Yeenoghu can lead to a startling increase in the gnoll population. Finding and killing the fang is the only way to keep that population in check.
