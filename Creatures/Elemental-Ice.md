## Description
The elemental planes of water, earth, fire, and air align on planar borders where two elements combine to form a new dual-element, such as earth and fire creating lava. These border zones give rise to new hybrid elementals made of the combined element.

An ice elemental, composed of water and air, appears as a large chunk of jagged ice often formed into a vaguely humanoid shape. It floats through icy water in frosted landscapes or rests inside tranquil snowbanks, creaking as it moves its frozen body.

Anything that touches an ice elemental is magically chilled by an icy cold that seeps into the bones. They are also capable of expelling a frigid blast of icy wind from small cracks in their bodies. Ice elementals are wary of fire, and screech like dry ice when burned.
