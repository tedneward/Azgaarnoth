**Bardic Inspiration (d8)** Mindbenders can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, they use a bonus action on their turn to choose one creature other than themselves within 60 feet of them who can hear them. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d8. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. If a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from the mindbender and casts a spell, the creature can roll that die and add the number rolled to one damage or healing roll of the spell. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost. Mindbenders can use this feature a number of times equal to their Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). They regain any expended uses when they finish a long rest.

**Song of Rest** Mindbenders can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize their wounded allies during a short rest. If a mindbender or any friendly creatures who can hear their performance regains hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

**Countercharm** Mindbenders have the ability to use words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, they can start a performance that lasts until the end of their next turn. During that time, they and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of them have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear them to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if them are incapacitated or silenced or if they voluntarily end it (no action required).

**Psychic Blades** Mindbenders have the ability to make their weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind. When they hit a creature with a weapon attack, they can expend one use of their Bardic Inspiration to deal an additional 3d6 psychic damage to that target. They can do so only once per round on their turn.

**Words of Terror** If a mindbender speaks to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, they can attempt to seed paranoia and fear into its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against the mindbender's spell save DC or be frightened of the mindbender or another creature of the mindbender's choice. The target is frightened in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that the mindbender tried to frighten it. This feature cannot be used again until after a short rest or long rest.

**Mantle of Whispers** Mindbenders have the ability to adopt a humanoid's persona. When a humanoid dies within 30 feet of them, they can magically capture its shadow using their reaction. They retain this shadow until they use it or they finish a long rest. The mindbender can use the shadow as an action. When it does so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on it. It now looks like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until the mindbender ends it as a bonus action. While in the disguise, the mindbender gains access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that the mindbender can pass itself off as the person by drawing on its memories. Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the mindbender's Charisma (Deception) check. The mindbender gains a +5 bonus to the check. Once the mindbender captures a shadow with this feature, it can't capture another one with it until it finishes a short or long rest.

**Spellcasting Focus** Mindbenders can use their weapons as an arcane focus for their spells.
