**Teleport**. The hag magically teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space she can see that is within 10 feet of a fire that is at least 10 feet high or wide.

#### Description
Cinder hags can be found wherever temperatures are high, such as sun-baked deserts, steaming jungles and scorched plains. Cinder hags have coal-black skin and piercing red eyes, while their hair is a mixture of red and orange and occasionally moves on its own, such that it resembles a burning fire. A cinder hag often rubs her skin with ash and charcoal, though they prefer bone ash from intelligent creatures, humanoids in particular.
A cinder hag possesses the ability to teleport great distances, but only if her destination is near a large, open conflagration. When she does so, she leaves a faint cloud of foul-smelling smoke in her wake.

**Incendiary Fey**. Cinder hags have a grim fascination with watching things burn, though nothing pleases a cinder hag more than watching a humanoid settlement burn. Fire is essential to many crafts that settled people cannot live without, such as metalworking, but when fire grows uncontrolled, it is wild and destructive.

At the heart of every cinder hag's lair burns a great fire called a grimflame. While the hag lives, this fire cannot be extinguished by nonmagical means. Through the fire, she sees distant occurrences, and she can command it to rise at her order.

Cinder hags often bind creatures of elemental fire into serving them. Most cinder hag lairs are infested with magmins, while the most powerful of cinder hags bind efreeti into their service.

**Covens**. A cinder hag that is part of a [coven](Hag-Covens.md) has a challenge rating of 7 (2,900 XP).

Every cinder hag tends a large fire called a grimflame. A grimflame must be at least 10 feet high and 10 feet wide for the hag to use its magic. While the hag is within 10 feet of her grimflame, she can use an action to percieve anything happening within 1 mile of the grimflame, as if she had cast the [scrying](/Magic/Spells/scrying.md) spell.

As an action, the hag can command the grimflame to rise into a mobile form for 1 minute. The grimflame uses the below statistics and obeys any verbal commands given to it by the hag.
