Keen Hearing. The hag has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on hearing.
Innate Spellcasting. The hag's innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 13). She can innately cast
the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: dancing lights, disguise self, gust of wind,
minor illusion, thunderwave
3/day each: charm person, cyclone (new), wind funnel
(new), wind wall
l /day each: [control winds](../Magic/Spells/control-winds.md)
See Invisibility. The hag can see invisible creatures and
objects as if they were visible, and she can see into the
Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear
ghostly and translucent.
Actions
Multiattack The hag makes two claw attacks. If both
attacks hit the same target, the target takes 9 (2d8)
extra slashing damage.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: l 3 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
Improved Invisibility. The hag magically turns invisible
until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a
spell) or she casts a spell. Any equipment the hag wears
or carries is invisible with her.
Shrieking Howl (Recharge 5-6). The hag shrieks loudly
enough that she can be heard from up to 500 feet
away. Each other creature within 60 feet of the hag
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
saving throw, a creature takes (2d8) thunder damage
and (2d8) psychic damage and it is deafened until the
end of the hag's next turn. While a creature is deafened
in this way, it is confused, giving it disadvantage on
attack rolls, Intelligence checks, and Wisdom checks.
Other howling hags are immune to this ability.

## Description
Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.

**Faces of Evil.** Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair, horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch. Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.

All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity.

Hags name themselves in darkly whimsical ways, claiming monikers such as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug, Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.

**Monstrous Motherhood.** Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother’s womb, the hag consumes the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.

Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.

**Dark Bargains.** Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.

Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something dear — especially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge gained through the bargain.

**A Foul Nature.** Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, suppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might “help” such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.

This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects of a hag’s life. A hag might fly in a magical giant’s skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.

**Dark Sorority.** Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag in existence. Hags don’t like each other, but they abide by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into another hag’s territory, bring gifts when entering another hag’s dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags — as long as the oath isn’t given with the fingers crossed.

Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags’ rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before teaching it a permanent lesson.

**Dark Lairs.** Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag’s lair reflects the creature’s noxiousness, such that the land itself can attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby, while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers.

Howling hags prefer to live near or within the communities of the humanoids they prey upon, usually hiding within towns and cities. These hags hide their true form, which is yellow or tan, wrinkled, and sagging, behind a carefully-crafted illusory disguise, living as beautiful performers, artists, merchants, and even courtesans. Howling hags especially enjoy any role that enables them to make use of their alluring singing or speaking voice. They use the opportunities afforded by these personas to strike at their victims, invisibly carrying them away when they won't be heard or tearing them apart with both claws in one deadly embrace.

**Masters of Wind.** Howling hags have a magical affinity for wind and sound. They can command winds to push or pull foes, to hurl them into the air, or to create a protective wall. When they spread their arms wide, wind rushes to them, carrying them into the air in magical flight. They have excellent hearing even for hags, and their innate magic protects them from losing their hearing.

**Vain of Voice.** There are few hags more vain than howling hags, and their vanity is the strongest in regards to the sound of their voice. A howling hag's voice changes while they are disguised by their own magic, becoming lovely and melodic. But a howling hag's true voice - heard only when her true form is revealed - is raspy, grating, and physically painful to listen to. Despite this, howling hags believe their true voice to be the most beautiful of alL saved as a gift for those they devour. They are remarkably easy to flatter when it comes to their true voices, but insulting one will greatly enrage the hag.

**Covens.** A howling hag that is part of a [coven](Hag-Coven.md) has a challenge rating of 8 (3,900 XP).
