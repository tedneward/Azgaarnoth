# Frog
The classic reptile found in swamps, marshlands, grasslands, prairies, and anywhere small insects can be found. Frogs are often considered good luck by many Hordes tribes, though some Dradehalians--having had unpleasant encounters with [bullywug](./Bullywug.md)s in the past--believe they are the symbol of unfortunate travels, and have taken to throwing a coin to any frog they see in order to placate the unlucky spirits.

## Frog
A frog has no effective attacks. It feeds on small insects and typically dwells near water, in trees, or underground. The frog’s statistics can also be used to represent a toad, though some say toads are slightly better-looking and slightly less wise. (Kidding.)

## Giant Toad
Giant toads breed successfully in the wild, and usually prefer deep forests, such as the wilderness of [Northern Bedia](../Geography/Bedia.md). Many, however, have been domesticated by various tribes, and so they can often be found in entirely non-native habitats, including the [Underdark](../Geography/Underdark.md). They are also commonly found among the various [Undersea](../Geography/Undersea.md) tribes.
