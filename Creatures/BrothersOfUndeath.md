## Death Knight
The truest and deadliest form of the this line of undead, a death knight is a skeletal warrior clad in fearsome plate armor. Beneath its helmet, one can see the knight's skull with malevolent pinpoints of light burning in its eye sockets. When a paladin that falls from grace dies without seeking atonement, dark powers can transform the once-mortal knight into this hateful undead creature. Rumors that certain pale masters have learned how to make the transformation on recently-deceased paladins, however, fuel nightmares in divine barracks all over Azgaarnoth.

***Eldritch Power.*** The death knight retains the ability to cast divine spells. However, no death knight can use its magic to heal. A death knight also attracts and commands lesser undead, although death knights that serve powerful fiends might have fiendish followers instead. Death knights often use [warhorse skeletons](Skeletons.md#warhorse-skeleton) and [nightmares](Nightmare.md) as mounts.

***Immortal Until Redeemed.*** A death knight can arise anew even after it has been destroyed. Only when it atones for a life of wickedness or finds redemption can it finally escape its undead purgatory and truly perish.

***Undead Nature.*** A death knight doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 35 (10d6) fire damage and 35 (10d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
