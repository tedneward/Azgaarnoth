# Centipede
Typically, the centipede is of no threat (or even interest, except perhaps as material components for spells), but its larger kin can be unnerving--and deadly.

## Giant Centipede
Giant centipedes can be found in many cavern systems across Azgaarnoth, particularly close to easy sources of food (such as down-on-their-luck kobold tribes).

## Swarm of Centipedes
The swarms presented here aren’t ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. Even druids can’t charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.

>***Swarm.***. The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
>
>#### Actions
>***Bites.***. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm’s space. Hit: 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by a swarm of centipedes is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
