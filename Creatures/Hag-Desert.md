Desert Dweller. The hag is naturally adapted to hot
climates and never needs to drink water.
Innate Spellcasting. The hag's innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast
the following spells, requiring no material components:
3/day each: barkskin (self only), disguise self
{including the form of a Medium humanoid), sand
cloak (new)
1 /day each: hallucinatory terrain
Actions
Claw. Me lee Weapon Attack:+ 5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage and the
target is grappled (escape DC 14).
Enthralling Kiss. The hag kisses a creature within 5 feet.
If the creature is not willing, it must succeed on a DC
11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the kiss. A creature
kissed in this way must succeed on a DC 1 3 Wisdom
saving throw or become charmed by the hag for 1 hour,
with the same effects as a charm person spell. While a
creature is charmed by this ability, it sees an illusion of
the hag made beautiful instead of her true form, and
believes the true form of the hag seen by others to be
the illusion.

## Description
Tan hunched, emaciated, and sun-shriveled, the desert
hags tread slowly and steadily across the dunes
searching for lost travelers to entice and devour. If the
target is well-provisioned, the hag uses her powers of
illusion to appear as a lost and beautiful traveler in dire
need of assistance. If the target is in need, she uses her
abilities to appear as a beautiful traveler awaiting them
in a secluded oasis. Her goal is to use her magical kiss
upon her victim, charming them and luring them back
to her lair to be devoured in safety.

**Person Jerky.** Desert hags often roam the desert in
long and winding journeys, so they often dry and salt the
meat of their victims, making jerky and other cured
meats out of the hapless humanoids that they encounter
and consume. They carry some of this dried meat with
them on their journeys, sustaining themselves with it
when prey is too sparse or dangerous.

**Mirage Weavers.** Desert hags use their powers of
illusion to weave detailed mirages over the landscape,
disguising their lairs as something less frightening or
creating the right desert backdrop to enact their
deceptions in. They take great pride in the efficacy of
these mirages, and can be thrown into a rage if her
illusory weaving is insulted or belittled.

**Covens.** A desert hag that is part of a [coven](Hag-Covens.md) has a challenge rating of 4 (1,100 XP}
