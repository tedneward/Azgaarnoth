# Chaos Spawn
A warrior who is visited by too many gifts from the lords of the Lower Planes eventually succumbs to madness and mutation. His altered body reaches a point where reason no longer sustains it, and he wails in anguish as his flesh ripples, sprouts and writhes, undergoing the most profound and final of changes. Some unfortunates burst open like fleshy flowers, bloat like week-old corpses, or find tentacles and hairy arms that end in twisted mockeries of their own faces emerging from every orifice. Some grow into distended caricatures of beasts, with the heads of insects or predators pushing out from their chests and shoulders. Others find their rapidly swelling flesh covered in blisters and buboes that burst open to reveal great bloodshot eyeballs, horror and panic writ large in every one. Truly, the chaos spawn can have a thousand faces and forms. The only thing that unites them is the repugnance of their new bodies.

Wretched Existence. This new life, so casually granted by the archdemons of the Abyss, is always a short and painful one. It is the fate of the chaos spawn to die, either on the field of battle by axe or sword, torn apart in the wilds by a creature even more savage and desperate, or literally ripped asunder by the wild chaotic energies that course through its tortured body. Driven to violence by their madness, in battle, a chaos spawn will charge the enemy with desperate energy, moaning and roaring in a mixture of rage and anguish that a clean blow will put them out of their misery. Retreat is unthinkable to a spawn, for the killing blows of the enemy are a blissful release compared to their tormented existence.
