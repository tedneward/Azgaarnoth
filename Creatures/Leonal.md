> Leonals are charismatic, natural leaders, and
paragons of bravery. The leonals are exceptional
combatants, with powerful magic to back their
natural weapons. When found with other guardinals,
they take on a commanding role. When found alone,
they’re often in a self-exile, searching for meaning in
the universe.
