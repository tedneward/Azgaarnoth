## Description
Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.

**Faces of Evil.** Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair, horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch. Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.

All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity.

Hags name themselves in darkly whimsical ways, claiming monikers such as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug, Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.

**Monstrous Motherhood.** Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother’s womb, the hag consumes the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.

Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.

**Dark Bargains.** Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.

Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something dear — especially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge gained through the bargain.

**A Foul Nature.** Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, suppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might “help” such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.

This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects of a hag’s life. A hag might fly in a magical giant’s skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.

**Dark Sorority.** Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag in existence. Hags don’t like each other, but they abide by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into another hag’s territory, bring gifts when entering another hag’s dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags — as long as the oath isn’t given with the fingers crossed.

Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags’ rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before teaching it a permanent lesson.

**Dark Lairs.** Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag’s lair reflects the creature’s noxiousness, such that the land itself can attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby, while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers.

The mad crimson hags are known for reveling in blood, fire, ashes, and destruction. More than anything, they enjoy starting fires that consume entire communities, especially if they can trick the inhabitants into being trapped within the conflagration. They often appear in the flames and smoke, cackling and taunting their helpless victims as they reveal their true ashen, gray form and their burning red eyes.

When they can't ignite an entire village or town, these hags settle for using their illusory disguises to frame others for arson and cause chaos that way. Crimson hags have just as much love for deception as other hags, and often pose as diviners that peer into mystical flames when enacting their schemes. Their most favorite trick is to be "captured" as a witch and burned at the stake, cackling madly as they turn the flames on their captors.

**Maddened By Terrors.** The sight of fresh blood drives a crimson hag into a temporary state of madness. In this blood madness, the hag experiences hallucinations of horrors and terrors, shrieking things that test one's sanity, and visions from beyond By the time they are adults, crimson hags have been driven to a constant state of half-madness, and they no longer fear not only their own hallucinations, but anything at all These hags enjoy the rush they feel while in the blood madness, and eagerly scheme for their best opportunity to enter the state and enjoy the reckless sadism that it brings to the fullest before the blood madness ends.

**Self-Destructive Covens.** There are many reasons why a coven of crimson hags, once established, rarely lasts very long. The most prominent is the hags' love for wanton destruction and especially their blood madness. In the throes of the madness, a crimson hag will often attack its own allies, including other crimson hags within the coven, if they are nearby. Of course, even without the blood madness, a crimson hag's love for ruin, destruction, and deception make schemes of betrayal and sabotage all the more enticing. However, this results in great collateral damage. When a powerful coven of crimson hags self-destructs, it can cause untold carnage, destruction, and death across the land.

A crimson hag that is part of a [coven](Hag-Covens.md) has a challenge rating of 6 (2,300 XP).
