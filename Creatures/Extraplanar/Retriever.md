## Retriever
The retriever is a potent, spider-like Construct conceived and built by Underdark followers of Lolth for one original purpose--to prowl the Abyss and capture demons for these cultists to enslave or use in their rituals. The automatons proved so effective and so fearsome that they now perform many different missions.

Though retrievers were created to operate only in the Abyss, they are sometimes dispatched when a powerful devotee of Lolth needs some creature or object captured and brought back alive and intact. Only under the rarest of circumstances is a retriever handed over or sold to others, since Lolth's cultists don't want to take the chance that their creations will be turned against them.

>***Faultless Tracker.*** The retriever is given a quarry by its master. The quarry can be a specific creature or object the master is personally acquainted with, or it can be a general type of creature or object the master has seen before. The retriever knows the direction and distance to its quarry as long as the two of them are on the same plane of existence. The retriever can have only one such quarry at a time.
