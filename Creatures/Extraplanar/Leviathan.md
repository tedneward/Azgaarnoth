## Leviathan
A leviathan is an immense creature that acts as a force of nature, dragging ships down to the ocean's depths and washing away coastal settlements. When called forth, a leviathan arises from a large body of water and takes on the form of a gigantic serpent.

Usually found only on the Elemental Plane of Water, a leviathan sometimes swims through a portal to another world, where tritons, sea elves, and other aquatic folk attempt to contain it. Nihilistic cults have also been known to perform arduous rituals to summon a leviathan to a world, with the aim of using the creature to destroy coastal communities. Those cultists often consider it a blessing to drown themselves in the elemental's waters.
