# Troll
Born with horrific appetites, trolls eat anything they can catch and devour. They have no society to speak of, but they do serve as mercenaries to [orcs](Orc.md), [ogres](Ogre.md), ettins, hags, and [giants](Giant.md). As payment, trolls demand food and treasure. Trolls are difficult to control, however, doing as they please even when working with more powerful creatures.

**Regeneration.** Smashing a troll’s bones and slashing through its rubbery hide only makes it angry. A troll’s wounds close quickly. If the monster loses an arm, a leg, or even its head, those dismembered parts can sometimes act with a life of their own. A troll can even reattach severed body parts, untroubled by its momentary disability. Only acid and fire can arrest the regenerative properties of a troll’s flesh. The trolls, enraged, will attack individuals making acid and fire attacks against them above all other prey.

**Troll Freaks.** Their regenerative capabilities make trolls especially susceptible to mutation. Although uncommon, such transformations can result from what the troll has done or what has been done to it. A decapitated troll might grow two heads from the stump of its neck, while a troll that eats a fey creature might gain one or more of that creature’s traits.

Trolls that are nearly obliterated but survive and regenerate from mere scraps of flesh can display bizarre mutations. One of these warped trolls is especially likely to arise if the creature regenerates in the presence of magical emanations, planar energy, disease, or death on a vast scale, or if its body was damaged by elemental forces. These mutated forms can also be produced and shaped by the ritual magic of evil spellcasters.

**VAPRAK THE DESTROYER.** Although trolls are hardly devout and seldom ponder spiritual questions, they do fear and venerate the entity known as Vaprak the Destroyer. As with many lesser deities, Vaprak’s true nature is something of a mystery, but it is always portrayed as a horrid, misshapen, greenish creature strongly resembling a troll. It’s given to fits of mindless destruction and is constantly paranoid about the plots and ambitions of other deities.

Among trolls, Vaprak is believed to devour those on the brink of death, but only if the troll is already cooked or digested (slain by fire or acid). Otherwise, the god spits the soul back into the world to regenerate a new body, no matter how little of its previous form remained. Thus, only trolls slain by acid or fire remain dead, because only those are consumed by Vaprak.

#### Description
![Dire Troll](Troll-Dire.png) Trolls kill and eat almost anything — including, in rare cases, other trolls. This cannibalism has the effect of causing the troll to grow to an unusually large size. These dire trolls crave more and more troll flesh to fuel their continued growth.

Dire trolls also increase their size by grafting flesh and organs onto themselves. When a slab of quivering troll flesh is bound against a fresh wound on the dire troll, its regenerative capacity incorporates the new mass into its own musculature. Even more horrifying are the multiple arms, eyes, claws, and other organs that a dire troll tears from its victims and grafts onto itself. Over time, these creatures can accumulate many limbs.

#### Description
![Rot Troll](Troll-Rot.png) A troll that is infused with waves of necrotic energy as it regenerates can develop a symbiotic relationship with that deathly power. The troll’s body withers, and its flesh falls away from the body as quickly as it forms. Eventually a rot troll becomes unable to regenerate, though it still heals normally. The creature courses with necrotic energy that flows out of its withered form. Simply standing near a rot troll exposes other creatures to its lethal emanations.

#### Description
![Spirit Troll](Troll-Spirit.png) A troll blasted with psychic energy can take a nonphysical form when it regenerates. Its psyche survives, but the body of a spirit troll is as insubstantial as shadow. The troll might be unaware of the transition — it still moves and attacks with teeth and claws as it always did — but now it strikes at its victim’s mind.

**Venom Spray (Recharge 6).** The troll slices itself with a claw, releasing a spray of poison in a 15-foot cube. The troll takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage (this damage can’t be reduced in any way). Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (4d8) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Description
![Venom Troll](Troll-Venom.png) A troll ravaged by massive doses of poison might mutate into a venom troll. Lingering poison infuses its blood and tissue, and poison leaks from its pores to coat its fangs and claws. These creatures are especially dangerous in close combat, because poison drips off their flesh and sprays out from every wound they receive.
