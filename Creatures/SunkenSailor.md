**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the sunken sailor to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the sunken sailor drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Turn Resistance.** A sunken sailor has advantage on saving throws on Turn Undead attempts if the sunken sailor is on the vessel they died on.

**Create Spawn.** Any humanoid reduced to zero hit points by a sunken sailor's drowning touch that then fails their death saves becomes a sunken sailor under the control of its killer at dawn the next morning. Any holy blessing can prevent this.

#### Actions
**Multiattack.** Sunken sailors make two claw attacks. If either one hits, they also make a a Drowning Touch attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.

**Drowning Touch.** When a sunken sailor hits an enemy, sea water builds up in the victim's lungs, threatening to drown them. The victim must make a Wisdom save (DC 13) against drowning; success means the victim takes an additional 1d4 damage, failure means the victim takes the damage and must spend their next action trying to get as far away from water (regardless of how deep) as they can.

## Description
Sunken sailors are the soulless but not lifeless cadavers of sailors lost at sea. They haunt the locations of their death: underwater or coastal areas where there is treasure present--especially if the treasure was taken from the ship upon which they lost their lives.
