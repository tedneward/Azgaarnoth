## Nightstriker Serpent
Nightstriker serpents are nocturnal ambush predators with scales as dark as the night sky and hearts just as dark. A nightstriker serpent's venom is considerably more potent than that of an ordinary snake, but by far the most terrifying thing about them is the fact that they seem to meld with ambient darkness, such that they are almost never seen by their victims until it is too late.

A nightstriker serpent's body is composed partly of shadow, so it is immune to poison and has some measure of resistance to several forms of destructive energy and conventional weapons.
