## Greater Giant Lizard
Greater giant lizards are over 10 feet long and weigh around 400 pounds. Normally solitary hunters, their preferred tactic is to use their infectious maw to wound prey and then stalk it as it weakens over time. By tasting the air with their sensitive tongue, greater giant lizards can locate even concealed prey. Though they look slow and lumbering, they are capable of surprising quickness when necessary and can swim significant distances. These overlarge monitor lizards have been mistaken for a kind of "dragon" by isolated, primitive islanders.
