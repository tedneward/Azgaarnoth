Ravenous Presence. When an allied troll within 30 feet of this troll hits a creature with a bite attack, it is a critical hit, provided that this troll isn't incapacitated.

Regeneration. The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the troll's next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

Actions
Multiattack. The troll makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

Vaprak's Fury (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The troll targets up to three allied trolls it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target gains advantage on melee attack rolls until the end of its next turn. In addition, each target regains 10 hit points unless they took acid or fire damage during its last turn.
