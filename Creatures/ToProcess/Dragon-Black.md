# Creature: Black Dragon
Also called "skull dragons" for the shape of their heads, black dragons are the most malicious chromatic dragons. They revel in causing pain and will hunt, not just for food, but because they thoroughly enjoy causing pain. Ironically, they are also the most cowardly, and will quickly run from a fight when things start to turn sour.

Their favorite things to feed on are sentient beings, but they have a special taste for fey creatures, which they relish as delicacy. They also feast on various swamp creatures such as small mammals and alligators, but many black dragons have rancid pools of water somewhere in their lair where they allow fresh meat to "pickle" for days at a time before eating it. They prefer the texture and flavor of such putrefied meat.

When they can, Black Dragons always choose to fight in the water or on the wing; never will they fight on the ground by choice.

## Tactics
A black dragon always makes its lair near water, and its favorite hunting strategy is to lie in wait beneath murky water for unsuspecting passersby. From the water (or if forced into the air), it will blast foes with its acid breath and then retreat back into the water (or the sky) to wait for it to recharge. If engaged in melee, it may attempt to grapple a single target and drag them down into the water where it can finish the creature off with ease.

## Terrain and Habitat
Black dragons prefer swamps with thick trees and vegetation, and deep murky water; if the swamp is too shallow, these dragons will likely not live there because deeper water suits their needs for combat and building lairs. If a black dragon cannot find a deep swamp, it may settle for any place water comes into contact with land in great quantities, such as jungles, rainforests, or occasionally even lakes in nearly any terrain (aside from cold). That said, they never make homes in places with salt water, as salt water irritates their flesh like a bad rash.

## Lairs
A black dragon usually chooses a network of caves or a hollow with multiple chambers. Some of the caverns are submerged and the lair nearly always has its main entrance hidden underwater in the bog, secured with a layer of strategically placed vegetation or a wall of mud. The lair also has an above-ground exit that the dragon keeps equally well-hidden.

## Favored Treasure
Black dragons value coins above all other treasure. This is because coins can withstand the wear of time, especially while submerged in the dragon's lair. It is unclear why they do not prefer gems, which would last even longer, but scholars speculate that it is because coins are refined, and therefore are intrinsically of more value than gems.

They especially covet coins or other artifacts from ancient civilizations or empires that they have outlasted.

## Environmental Diffusion
When a dead black dragon experiences Environmental Diffusion, the magical energies that were a part of its living body disperse into the environment. The result is abnormal humidity and foul soil. Few plants grow there, and those that do are poisonous. If water pools over the grave of the dragon, it becomes acidic and hurts to touch. This water loses that property when taken.

## Physical Traits
A black dragons horn's actually serve no offensive purpose; they are purely defensive, to protect the dragon's head. Its eyes are sunken, furthering the skull-like appearance, but underwater the dragon's eyes bulge almost comically, allowing it improved depth perception and awareness in even the murkiest of bogs. Its phalanges are webbed, but the webbing is more prominent on the back paws than on the front. They can absorb water through their skin like some other amphibians, but they must surface to breathe air for a few hours at least once or twice a week. They have a strong, acidic scent.

## Black Dragon [Feats](DraconicFeats.md)

### Acid Blast
*Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.*

The dragon gains a new Breath Weapon option:

**Acid Blast.** The dragon chooses a point on the ground within 60 feet of it that it can see, and then exhales an acidic bomb that lands on that point. All creatures within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to half of the dragon's Acid Breath damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. A pool of residual acid forms in that same area. Any creature that starts its turn in the pool or enters the area for the first time on its turn takes 13 (3d8) acid damage. The pool is difficult terrain and dissipates after 3 (1d6) rounds, or until cleared (such as by running water).

### Acidic Blood
When the dragon has half of its hit points remaining or less, if it is hit by an attack from a creature within 5 feet of it, the attacker takes 9 (2d8) acid damage.

### Charm Reptiles
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

The dragon gains the following action option:

**Charm Reptiles (3/Day).** The dragon casts [animal friendship]() on all reptiles within 30 feet of it, without requiring material components. The dragon can communicate with any charmed animals as if it had cast a [speak with animals]() spell.

### Corrupt Water
*Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.*

The dragon gains the following action option:

**Corrupt Water (1/Day).** The dragon magically stagnates up to 10 cubic feet of a body of water that it can see within 120 feet of it, making it become still, foul, and unable to sustain animal life. The water remains corrupt until purified, such as by a [purify food and drink]() spell. Any creature to drink the water regurgitates it in 1d4 minutes and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.

### Death Dragon
The dragon has resistance to necrotic and poison damage, and has advantage on saving throws made to resist becoming poisoned.

### Horn Parry
The dragon gains the following reaction option:

**Horn Parry.** The dragon adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the dragon must be aware of the attacker.

### Potent Acid
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

The dragon's attacks ignore resistance to acid damage. When the dragon rolls acid damage, it can treat any 1 rolled on a damage die as a 2.

### Swamp Dragon
The dragon ignores cover granted by water, and has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide while submerged.

### Vile Resolve
The dragon can add double its proficiency bonus on saving throws against being charmed, dominated, or frightened.

### Viscous Acid
If a creature takes damage from the dragon's Breath Weapon, acid sticks to the creature's armor and flesh. At the beginning of each of its turns, the creature takes 9 (2d8) acid damage until it or another creature takes an action to either clean off or neutralize the acid.
