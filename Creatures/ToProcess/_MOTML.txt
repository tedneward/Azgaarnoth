Leucrotta
A leucrotta is what you would get if you took the head of a giant badger, the legs of a deer, and the body of a large hyena, then put them together and reanimated them with demon ichor without bothering to cover up the stink of death.

The first leucrottas came into being alongside some gnolls during the rampages of Yeenoghu (appears in this book) on the Material Plane. While many of the hyenas that ate Yeenoghu’s kills transformed into gnolls, others underwent more bizarre changes; leucrottas were the most numerous of these.

As clever as it is cruel, a leucrotta loves to deceive, torture, and kill. Creatures who venerate Yeenoghu—particularly his gnoll followers—view leucrottas with great respect. Although a leucrotta is unlikely to lead a gnoll war band, it can influence the leader and might agree to carry the leader into battle and offer advice during the fight. Followers of Yeenoghu also see leucrottas as a form of entertainment. They enjoy watching a leucrotta work almost as much as they like doing their own killing, since leucrottas are meticulous in their cruelty and able to draw out kills for better and longer sport. And when there are no victims to be had, a leucrotta can mimic the delightful squeals of a suffering victim.

A leucrotta is so loathsome that few outside of its own kind can stand to be around one for long. Its horrific, hodgepodge body oozes a foul stench. This reek is outdone only by the creature’s breath, which issues from a maw that drips fluid corrupted with rot and digestive juices. In place of fangs, a leucrotta has bony ridges as hard as steel that can crush bones and lacerate flesh. These plates are so tough that a leucrotta can use them to peel plate armor away from the body of a slain knight.

A leucrotta’s stench would normally warn away prey long before the creature could attack. It has two natural capabilities, however, that give it an advantage. First, a leucrotta’s tracks are nearly impossible to distinguish from those of common deer. Second, it can duplicate the call or the vocal expressions of just about any creature it has heard. The monster uses its mimicry to lure in potential victims, then attacks while they are confused or unaware of the actual threat.

Mimicry. The leucrotta can mimic Beast sounds and Humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations only with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.

Stench. Any creature other than a leucrotta or gnoll that starts its turn within 5 feet of the leucrotta must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature’s next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Stench of all leucrottas for 1 hour.

Actions

Multiattack. The leucrotta makes one Bite attack and one Hooves attack.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the leucrotta scores a critical hit, it rolls the damage dice three times, instead of twice.

Hooves. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

Bonus Actions

Kicking Retreat. Immediately after the leucrotta makes a Hooves attack, it takes the Disengage action.


Leviathan
A leviathan is an immense creature that acts as a force of nature, dragging ships down to the ocean’s depths and washing away coastal settlements. When called forth, a leviathan arises from a large body of water and takes on the form of a gigantic serpent.

Usually found only on the Elemental Plane of Water, a leviathan sometimes swims through a portal to another world, where tritons, sea elves, and other aquatic folk attempt to contain it. Nihilistic cults have also been known to perform arduous rituals to summon a leviathan to a world, with the aim of using the creature to destroy coastal communities. Those cultists often consider it a blessing to drown themselves in the elemental’s waters.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the leviathan fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Partial Freeze. If the leviathan takes 50 cold damage or more during a single turn, the leviathan partially freezes; until the end of its next turn, its speeds are reduced to 20 feet, and it makes attack rolls with disadvantage.

Siege Monster. The leviathan deals double damage to objects and structures.

Water Form. The leviathan can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

Actions

Multiattack. The leviathan makes one Slam attack and one Tail attack.

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (2d12 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (2d12) acid damage.

Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) acid damage.

Tidal Wave (Recharge 6). The leviathan magically creates a wave of water that extends from a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. The wave is up to 250 feet long, up to 250 feet tall, and up to 50 feet wide. Each creature in the wave must make a DC 24 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (7d12) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. The water spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in its area and within 250 feet of it, and then it vanishes.

Legendary Actions

The leviathan can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The leviathan regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Move. The leviathan moves up to its speed.

Slam (Costs 2 Actions). The leviathan makes one Slam attack.

Martial Arts Adept

Martial arts adepts are disciplined monks with extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. Some protect monasteries; others travel the world seeking enlightenment or new forms of combat to master. A few become bodyguards, trading their combat prowess and loyalty for food and lodging.

Some martial artists adorn themselves with tattoos to honor inspirations or instructors, or to memorialize profound lessons, triumphs, or defeats. You may roll on the Martial Arts Adept Tattoos table to determine what sort of tattoo an adept bears.

Unarmored Defense. While the adept is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.

Actions

Multiattack. The adept makes three Unarmed Strike attacks or five Dart attacks.

Unarmed Strike. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage. Once per turn, the adept can cause one of the following additional effects (choose one or roll a d4):

1–2: Knock Down. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

3–4: Push. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet directly away from the adept.

Dart. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

Reactions

Deflect Missile. In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, the adept deflects the missile. The damage it takes from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + 3. If the damage is reduced to 0, the adept catches the missile if it’s small enough to hold in one hand and the adept has a hand free.

Marut
The nigh-unstoppable inevitables serve a singular purpose: they enforce contracts forged in the Hall of Concordance in the city of Sigil. Primus, the leader of the modrons, created maruts and other inevitables to bring order to dealings between planar folk. A wide array of disparate creatures, including yugoloths, will enter into a contract with inevitables if asked.

The Hall of Concordance is an embassy of pure law in Sigil, the City of Doors. In the hall, parties who agree to mutual terms—and who pay the requisite gold to the Kolyarut, a mechanical engine of absolute jurisprudence—can have their contract chiseled onto a sheet of gold that is placed in the chest of a marut. From that moment until the contract is fulfilled, the marut is bound to enforce its terms and to punish any party who breaks them. A marut resorts to lethal force only if a contract calls for it, if the contract is fully broken, or if the marut is attacked.

Inevitables care nothing for the spirit of an agreement, only the letter. A marut enforces what is written, not what was meant by or supposed to be understood from the writing. The Kolyarut rejects contracts that contain vague, contradictory, or unenforceable terms. Beyond that, it doesn’t care whether both parties understand what they’re agreeing to.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the marut fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Resistance. The marut has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Unusual Nature. The marut doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Actions

Multiattack. The marut makes two Unerring Slam attacks.

Unerring Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 60 force damage, and the target is pushed up to 5 feet away from the marut if it is Huge or smaller.

Blazing Edict (Recharge 5–6). Arcane energy emanates from the marut’s chest in a 60-foot cube. Every creature in that area takes 45 radiant damage. Each creature that takes any of this damage must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of the marut’s next turn.

Plane Shift (3/Day). The marut casts plane shift, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability. The marut can cast the spell normally, or it can cast the spell on an unwilling creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If it uses the latter option, the targeted creature must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a teleportation circle in the Hall of Concordance in Sigil.


Master Thief
Master thieves are known for perpetrating daring heists. They tend to develop a romanticized reputation. A master thief might “retire” from hands-on work to run a thieves’ guild, spearhead some covert enterprise, or enjoy a quiet life of luxury.


When a master thief completes a challenging heist, they often leave behind a calling card to taunt their victims. You may roll on the Master Thief Calling Cards table to determine what a master thief leaves behind.

Evasion. If the thief is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the thief instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails, provided the thief isn’t incapacitated.

Actions

Multiattack. The thief makes three Shortsword or Shortbow attacks.

Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.

Shortbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.

Bonus Actions

Cunning Action. The thief takes the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

Reactions

Uncanny Dodge. The thief halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The thief must be able to see the attacker.

Maurezhi
When Doresain, the King of Ghouls, corrupted a society of elves, he created a new sort of demon—the maurezhi—to lead packs of ghouls and ghasts (both appear in the Monster Manual) on the Material Plane.

When a maurezhi consumes the corpse of a Humanoid it has slain—a process that takes about 10 minutes—it instantly assumes the creature’s appearance as it was in life. The new appearance begins to rot away over the next few days, eventually revealing the demon’s original form.

A maurezhi is contagion incarnate. Its bite can drain a victim’s sense of self. If this affliction is allowed to go far enough, the victim is infected with an unholy hunger for flesh that overpowers their personality and transforms them into a ghoul.

Assume Form. The maurezhi can assume the appearance of any Medium Humanoid it eats. It remains in this form for 1d6 days, during which time the form gradually decays until, when the effect ends, the form sloughs from the demon’s body.

Magic Resistance. The maurezhi has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Multiattack. The maurezhi makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a Humanoid, its Charisma score is reduced by 1d4. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if this reduces its Charisma to 0. It rises 24 hours later as a ghoul (see the Monster Manual), unless it has been revived or its corpse has been destroyed.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an Undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Raise Ghoul (Recharge 5–6). The maurezhi targets one dead ghoul or ghast (see the Monster Manual) it can see within 30 feet of it. The target is revived with all its hit points.


Maw Demon
Maw demons share the ceaseless hunger for carnage and mortal flesh of their master, Yeenoghu, who appears in this book. After a maw demon rests for 8 hours, anything devoured by it is transported directly into the Lord of Savagery’s gullet.

Maw demons appear among gnoll war bands that worship Yeenoghu, usually summoned as part of ritual offerings of freshly slain Humanoids made to him. The gnolls don’t command the demons, which simply accompany the war band and attack whatever creatures the gnolls fall upon.

Because maw demons are indiscriminate in their hunger, their stomachs contain all manner of oddities in addition to the remains of their recent prey. You may choose one or more items appropriate for your campaign for a maw demon to contain, or roll on the Maw Demon’s Stomach Contents table.

Maw Demon’s Stomach Contents
d8	Stomach Contents
1	Intact wine skin with wine still in it
2	Iron skillet
3	Remnants of silk banner embroidered with a moon-and-stars motif
4	Corroded gauntlet with skeletal hand in it

6	Old leather boot
7	Beehive
8	Humanoid teeth
I once pulled a whole bottle of fine strawberry liquor from the belly of a maw demon. No clue where it might’ve devoured such a find, but I’m not complaining.

Disgorge (Recharge 6). The demon vomits in a 15-foot cube. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) acid damage and fall prone in the spew.


Meazel
Meazels are malicious hermits who fled to the Shadowfell to escape their mortal existence and contemplate their misery. There the shadows transformed them, and their bitterness made them twisted and cruel. Now hate burns in their hearts, and they resent any intrusion into their suffering, waylaying travelers who venture too close to their lairs.

The evil that corrupted meazels also imbued them with magical powers that allow them to move through shadows with ease. They can step from one pool of darkness into another one, using this talent to ambush prey. Sometimes they snatch victims around the throat with their strangling cords and then step away; other times they ferry their victims to isolated spots and then leave the hapless souls to the designs of whatever horrors lurk there.

Any creatures meazels draw through the shadows are cursed by the meazels’ baleful magic. The curse acts as a beacon; sorrowsworn (which appear in this book), Undead, and other terrors sense where they are located and descend on the stranded victims to tear them apart.

Actions

Garrote. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target of the meazel’s size or smaller. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13 with disadvantage). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the meazel’s turns. The meazel can’t make weapon attacks while grappling a creature in this way.

Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.

Shadow Teleport (Recharge 5–6). The meazel, any equipment it is wearing or carrying, and any creature it is grappling teleport to an unoccupied space within 500 feet of it, provided that the starting space and the destination are in dim light or darkness. The destination must be a place the meazel has seen before, but it need not be within line of sight. If the destination space is occupied, the teleportation leads to the nearest unoccupied space.

Any other creature the meazel teleports becomes cursed for 1 hour or until the curse is ended by remove curse or greater restoration. Until this curse ends, every Undead and every creature native to the Shadowfell within 300 feet of the cursed creature can sense it, which prevents that creature from hiding from them.

Bonus Actions

Shadow Stealth. While in dim light or darkness, the meazel takes the Hide action.


Meenlock
Meenlocks are Fey that invoke terror and seek to destroy all that is good, innocent, and beautiful. These bipeds have the heads and claws of crustaceans, and they primarily live in forests, although they adapt well to urban and subterranean settings.

Meenlocks are spawned by fear. When terror overwhelms a creature in the Feywild or another location where the Feywild’s influence is strong, one or more meenlocks might spontaneously arise in the shadows or darkness nearby. If more than one meenlock is born, a lair also magically forms. The earth creaks and moans as narrow, twisting tunnels open up within it. One of these passageways serves as the lair’s only entrance, and a large central chamber serves as the meenlocks’ den. Inside the warren, black moss covers every surface, muffling sound.

A meenlock can supernaturally sense areas of darkness and shadow in its vicinity and can teleport from one darkened space to another—enabling it to sneak up on its prey or run away when outmatched. Meenlocks also project a supernatural aura that instills terror in those nearby.

Telepathic Torment
Up to four meenlocks can telepathically torment one incapacitated creature, filling its mind with disturbing sounds and dreadful imagery. Participating meenlocks can’t use their telepathy for any other purpose during this time, though they can move about and take actions and reactions as normal. This torment has no effect on a creature that is immune to the frightened condition. If the creature is susceptible and remains incapacitated for 1 hour, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The save DC is 10 + the number of meenlocks participating in the torment, considering only those that remain within sight of the victim for the entire hour and aren’t incapacitated during it. The process can be repeated. A Humanoid that drops to 0 hit points as a result of this damage instantly transforms into a meenlock at full health and under the DM’s control. Only a wish spell or divine intervention can restore a transformed creature to its former state.

Light Sensitivity. While in bright light, the meenlock has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Actions

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Bonus Actions

Shadow Teleport (Recharge 5–6). The meenlock teleports to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of it, provided that both the space it’s teleporting from and its destination are in dim light or darkness. The destination need not be within line of sight.


Merregon
The souls of fallen soldiers, mercenaries, and bodyguards who served evil without reservation often find everlasting servitude in the Nine Hells as merregons. These faceless foot soldiers are the Hells’ legionnaires, tasked with protecting their infernal plane and its rulers against intruders.

Merregons have no individuality and hence no need for faces. Every merregon legionnaire has a metal mask bolted to its head. Markings on the mask indicate the only elements of the wearer’s identity that matter: the commander it serves and the layer of the Nine Hells it protects.

Because of their unshakable loyalty, merregons form the backbone of many devils’ protective retinues. They shrink from no task, no matter how dangerous. Unless ordered to fall back, they never retreat from a fight.

Halberd. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage.

Heavy Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage.

Reactions

Loyal Bodyguard. When another Fiend within 5 feet of the merregon is hit by an attack roll, the merregon causes itself to be hit instead.


Merrenoloth
The grim captains of the ferries on the River Styx, merrenoloths can navigate safely through the worst storms and always stay on course. Wielding fiery oars, merrenoloths strike fear into anyone who forcefully boards their vessels.

Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties) while captaining a vessel, the merrenoloth can take one of the following lair actions; it can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

Gale. The air within 60 feet of the vessel is filled with wind. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, that area is difficult terrain, and when a Medium or smaller creature flies into that area or starts its turn flying there, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Propel. A strong wind propels the vessel, increasing its speed by 30 feet until initiative count 20 on the next round.

Repair. The vessel regains 22 (4d10) hit points.

Regional Effects
A merrenoloth imbues its vessel with magic that creates one or more of the following effects:

Unerring. The vessel always stays on course to the destination the merrenoloth names.

Unsinkable. The vessel doesn’t sink even if its hull is breached.

If the merrenoloth dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d6 hours.

Mindwitness
If a beholder is stunned and brought to the brine pool of an elder brain (appears in this book), the beholder can be converted into a mindwitness. This alters some of its eye rays and transforms four of its eyestalks into tentacles similar to a mind flayer’s. The mindwitness is psychically imprinted with devotion to the elder brain and submission to illithid commands.

A mindwitness’s primary function is to improve telepathic communication in a mind flayer colony. A creature in telepathic communication with a mindwitness can converse through it to as many as seven other creatures the mindwitness can see, rapidly disseminating commands and other information.

If separated from its illithid masters, a mindwitness seeks out other telepathic creatures to tell it what to do. Mindwitnesses have been known to ally with flumphs (see the Monster Manual) and planar beings such as demons, shifting their worldview and alignment to match those of their new masters.

Telepathic Hub. When the mindwitness receives a telepathic message, it can telepathically share that message with up to seven other creatures within 600 feet of it that it can see.

Actions

Multiattack. The mindwitness makes one Bite attack and one Tentacles attack, or it uses Eye Ray three times.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (4d6 + 2) piercing damage.

Tentacles. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 20 (4d8 + 2) psychic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13), and it must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or be restrained until this grapple ends.

Eye Ray. The mindwitness shoots one magical eye ray at random (roll a d6, and reroll if the ray has already been used this turn), choosing one target it can see within 120 feet of it:

Aversion Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Psychic Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or take 27 (6d8) psychic damage.
Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can’t take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn but not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Stunning Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the mindwitness moves it up to 30 feet in any direction, and it is restrained by the ray’s telekinetic grip until the start of the mindwitness’s next turn or until the mindwitness is incapacitated.
If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn’t being worn or carried, it is telekinetically moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The mindwitness can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.


Moloch

Exiled from the Nine Hells, Moloch would do anything to reclaim his position. Long ago, Moloch earned his place among the other archdevils through the glory he won driving demons out of the Nine Hells. Asmodeus rewarded him by elevating him to the rulership of Malbolge.

For eons, Moloch ruled his domain, vying against the other archdevils as he sought still greater power. This animosity worked in Asmodeus’s favor, since Asmodeus knew that Moloch’s scheming helped keep the other archdevils in check. The arrangement unraveled, however, when Moloch took the night hag named Malagard for his advisor. Her poisonous words gradually convinced him to attempt to topple Asmodeus. The conspiracy nearly succeeded, but was ultimately thwarted. Moloch was stripped of his station and sentenced to death—only the timely use of a planar portal allowed him to escape.

Moloch wasted no time in preparing for his return. He amassed an army of devils and monsters and left them to make final preparations for invading the Nine Hells, while he ventured to the Material Plane in search of an artifact that would ensure his success. But while there, he became trapped, leaving his armies at the mercy of his enemies. They were destroyed in short order.

Moloch was rendered nearly powerless by this failure. He schemes of ways to reclaim his former status, but every time he enters the Nine Hells, he is demoted to an imp (see the Monster Manual) and can’t regain his normal powers until he leaves. Thus, he lives a split existence, sometimes plotting in Malbolge or other layers of the Hells and at other times wandering the planes in search of magical might or secrets that might help him win back his title.

Rumors suggest that he can often be found in Sigil, where he bargains with yugoloths to build yet another army with which he might invade Malbolge and wrest the throne from Glasya. Bereft as he is, he has little to offer in exchange, so he might bargain with mortals to gain their aid in acquiring coin, jewels, and other riches in return for knowledge about the Nine Hells and the other planes.

Most of Moloch’s cultists have switched allegiance to one of the other archdevils, but idols constructed to honor him still stand in deep dungeons, their jeweled eyes and the remnants of power they hold drawing monstrous worshipers and unwise adventurers into places where his foul influence remains.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Moloch fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Resistance. Moloch has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Regeneration. Moloch regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of his next turn. Moloch dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

Actions

Multiattack. Moloch makes one Bite attack, one Claw attack, and one Many-Tailed Whip attack.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (4d8 + 8) fire damage.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) force damage.

Many-Tailed Whip. Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d4 + 8) lightning damage plus 11 (2d10) thunder damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 30 feet in a straight line toward Moloch.

Breath of Despair (Recharge 5–6). Moloch exhales in a 30-foot cube. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or take 27 (5d10) psychic damage, drop whatever it is holding, and become frightened of Moloch for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from Moloch by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn’t take the Dash action. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to Moloch, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Spellcasting. Moloch casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 21):

Teleport. Moloch uses Teleport.

Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions). Moloch uses Spellcasting.


Moloch obsesses over the power he lost, rather than thinking of the power he could gain elsewhere in the planes. What a pity he so wastes his potential.

Molydeus
The fearsome molydeus speaks for the demon lord it serves and enforces its master’s will. This demon is 12 feet tall, and its bipedal body has a slavering wolf’s head and a fanged serpent’s head. Its demon lord can speak and see through the serpent head; this master also uses the molydeus to guard treasures, slay foes, and terrify troops into obedience.

A molydeus’s demon lord bestows on it a powerful weapon that dissolves if the molydeus dies. The weapon’s form varies depending on the creator, but that doesn’t affect the weapon’s capabilities.

Variant: Demon Summoning
You can give a molydeus the ability to summon other demons.

Summon Demon (1/Day). As an action, the molydeus has a 50 percent chance of summoning its choice of 1d6 babaus (also in this book), 1d4 chasmes, or one marilith (the chasme and marilith appear in the Monster Manual) A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the molydeus, acts as an ally of the molydeus, and can’t summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or the molydeus dies, or until the molydeus dismisses it as an action.

Magic Resistance. The molydeus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Multiattack. The molydeus makes one Demonic Weapon attack, one Snakebite attack, and one Wolf Bite attack.

Demonic Weapon. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (4d12 + 9) force damage. If the target has at least one head and the molydeus rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it can’t survive without that head.

Morkoth
Ancient and devious, morkoths are voracious collectors. Each one floats through the planes on a strange, mobile island, amassing the valuables, oddities, and castoffs of the multiverse in a massive, ever-growing collection.

The first morkoths arose in the Astral Plane when the petrified body of a deity of greed and strife collided with a remnant of celestial matter imbued with life-giving magic. The collision released a storm of chaotic energy and sent countless islands spinning away into the void. Within some of them, bits of the god’s petrified flesh came back to life as morkoths: tentacled monstrosities brimming with malice and greed.

Morkoths are driven by greed and selfishness mixed with a yearning for conflict. They hoard vast stores of treasure, knowledge, and captives on their islands. Some of these prisoners are the descendants of people captured generations before; they might know of no other world outside their island.

A morkoth may allow a visitor to bargain for something or someone it has claimed if that visitor offers the morkoth something it desires more. It shows no mercy, however, to those who break a deal or try to steal from it. A morkoth knows every person and object in its collection.

A morkoth’s island has the qualities of a dreamscape. It holds a jumble of objects and creatures the morkoth has collected, some of which date from forgotten times. An island might have natural-looking illumination, but most are shrouded in twilight, and on any of them, mists and shadows can appear without notice. The environment is warm and wet, a subtropical or tropical climate that keeps the morkoth and its “guests” comfortable.

Each island glides on planar currents and is safe from most harmful external effects—one could float in the skies of Avernus in the Nine Hells without harm to it or its residents. A morkoth’s island might be found anywhere from the bottom of the ocean to the void of the Astral Plane. Anything on or within a certain distance of a morkoth’s isle is drawn with it in its journey through the planes. Thus, people from lost civilizations and creatures or objects from bygone ages might be found within a morkoth’s dominion.

Some islands travel a specific route, arriving at the same destinations regularly over a cycle of years. Others are tied to a particular place or group of locales, and still others move erratically through the cosmos. Occasionally, a morkoth learns to direct its island’s movement.

Amphibious. The morkoth can breathe air and water.

Actions

Multiattack. The morkoth makes either two Bite attacks and one Tentacles attack or three Bite attacks.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage.

Tentacles. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns, and the morkoth can’t use its tentacles on another target.

Hypnosis. The morkoth projects a 30-foot cone of magical energy. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed by the morkoth for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the target tries to get as close to the morkoth as possible, using its actions to Dash until it is within 5 feet of the morkoth. A charmed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature has advantage on saving throws against the morkoth’s Hypnosis for 24 hours.

Spellcasting. The morkoth casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

At will: detect magic, mage hand

3/day each: darkness, dimension door, dispel magic, lightning bolt, sending

Reactions

Spell Reflection. If the morkoth makes a successful saving throw against a spell or a spell attack misses it, the morkoth can choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it can see within 120 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creature instead of the morkoth. If the spell forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.


A Morkoth’s Lair
A morkoth claims dominion over an entire island, and it also maintains a central sanctum on that isle. This lair is most often a twisted network of narrow tunnels that connect several underground chambers, although other structural forms might be incorporated. The morkoth dwells among the creatures and objects it prizes most in a spacious vault at the center of the warren, where the celestial fragments that make up the island’s core are also located. Sections of the lair and its center might be kept dry to better protect and preserve collected objects and creatures, but most of the lair is underwater.

A morkoth encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 12 (8,400 XP).

Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the morkoth can take one of the following lair actions:

Cast a Spell. The morkoth casts darkness, dispel magic, or misty step, using Intelligence as its spellcasting ability and without expending a spell slot.

Hypnotize. The morkoth uses its Hypnosis action, originating at a point within 120 feet of itself. It doesn’t need to see the effect’s point of origin.

Regional Effects
The island surrounding a morkoth’s lair is warped by the creature’s presence, creating the following effects:

Alter Water. With a thought (no action required), the morkoth can initiate a change in the water within its lair that takes effect 1 minute later. The water can be as breathable and clear as air, or it can be normal water (ranging in clarity from murky to clear).

Locate Creatures and Objects. The morkoth is aware of any new arrival, whether an object or a creature, on its island or in its sanctum. As an action, the morkoth can locate any one creature or object on the island. Visitors to the island feel as though they are being watched, even when they aren’t.

Lost Possessions. Each time a creature that has been on the island for less than a year finishes a short or long rest, it must make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the creature has misplaced one possession (chosen by the player, if the creature is that player’s character). The possession remains nearby but concealed for a short time, so it can be recovered with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. An object that is misplaced but not recovered ends up in the morkoth’s lair 1 hour later. If the creature later goes to the morkoth’s lair, its lost possessions stand out in its perception and are easily recovered.

Supernatural Lure. Entrances to the morkoth’s lair have an enchantment that the morkoth can activate or suppress at any time while it’s in its lair and not incapacitated. Any creature within 30 feet of such an entrance and able to see it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature feels an intense urge to use its movement on each of its turns to enter the lair and to move toward the morkoth’s location (the target doesn’t realize it’s heading toward a creature). The target moves toward the morkoth by the most direct route. As soon as it can see the morkoth, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. It can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and every time it takes damage.

If the morkoth dies, these regional effects end immediately.

Mouth of Grolantor
Hill giants consume spoiled food and diseased carcasses with as much enthusiasm as children eating dessert and rarely suffer for such eating habits. When one of their kind becomes incapable of keeping down food, that giant is seen, among hill giant worshipers of the god Grolantor, as the vessel of a message from the deity.

The sickened giant’s compatriots separate the giant from the rest of the community, often trapping them in a cage or tying them to a post. A priest of Grolantor visits the famished giant daily, trying to read portents in the puddles of bile the hill giant retches up. If the sickness soon passes, they allow the hill giant to rejoin society. If not, the hill giant is instead starved to the point of desperation so Grolantor’s hunger can be given a mouth in the world.

A mouth of Grolantor is revered as a holy embodiment of Grolantor’s aching hunger. Unlike a typical sluggish hill giant, a mouth of Grolantor is thin as a whippet, alert like a bird, and constantly twitchy. Mouths are kept perpetually imprisoned or shackled; if they break free, they’re sure to kill anyone nearby before they’re brought down or escape on a killing spree. The only time mouths of Grolantor are set loose is during a war, during a raid against an enemy settlement, or in a last-ditch defense of Grolantor’s faithful. When a mouth of Grolantor has slaughtered and eaten their fill of enemies, they pass out amid the gory remains of their victims, making them easy to recapture.

Mouth of Chaos. The giant is immune to the confusion spell.

On each of its turns, the giant uses all its movement to move toward the nearest creature or whatever else it might perceive as food. Roll a d10 at the start of each of the giant’s turns to determine its action for that turn:

1–3: The giant makes three Fist attacks against one random creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, the giant flies into a rage and gains advantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

4–5: The giant makes one Fist attack against each creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, the giant makes one Fist attack against itself.

6–7: The giant makes one Bite attack against one random creature within reach. If no other creatures are within reach, its eyes glaze over and it is stunned until the start of its next turn.

8–10: The giant makes one Bite attack and two Fist attacks against one random creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, the giant flies into a rage and gains advantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

Actions

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the giant magically regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.

Fist. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.


Monsters: N
Nabassu
The insatiable nabassus prowl the multiverse in search of souls to devour. If they think they can kill a creature and consume its soul, they attack—even if that other creature is a demon, including another nabassu.

Most other demons shun nabassus and force them to live on the fringes of the Abyss. There, nabassus pick off weaker demons or, if the situation warrants, gather in packs to take down larger prey. Some especially powerful nabassus even search for demon lords’ amulets.

Whenever magic pulls demons from the Abyss to the Material Plane, nabassus try to get summoned so that they can embark on a feast of souls there. A summoned nabassu seeks to break free so that it can devour the soul of its summoner and then feed on the souls of whatever other creatures it can catch. One way a summoner can avoid this fate is by providing a steady supply of souls to the nabassu, which might persuade the demon to be cooperative—as long as the supply lasts.

Demonic Shadows. The nabassu darkens the area around its body in a 10-foot radius. Nonmagical light can’t illuminate this area of dim light.

Devour Soul. A nabassu can eat the soul of a creature it has killed within the last hour, provided that creature is neither a Construct nor an Undead. The devouring requires the nabassu to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of Hit Dice (d8s) equal to half the creature’s number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice, and increase the nabassu’s hit points by the numbers rolled. For every 4 Hit Dice the nabassu gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage on a hit. The nabassu retains these benefits for 6 days. A creature devoured by a nabassu can be restored to life only by a wish spell.

Magic Resistance. The nabassu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Multiattack. The nabassu makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack, and it uses Soul-Stealing Gaze.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 38 (5d12 + 6) necrotic damage.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) force damage.

Soul-Stealing Gaze. The nabassu targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target isn’t a Construct or an Undead, it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or take 13 (2d12) necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt, and the nabassu regains hit points equal to half that amount. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0, and if the target is a Humanoid, it immediately rises as a ghoul (see the Monster Manual) under the nabassu’s control.


Nagpa
Long ago, the Raven Queen cursed a cabal of powerful wizards for meddling in a ritual that would have helped avert a war between the gods. She transformed them into the scabrous, birdlike creatures known as nagpas and rendered them able to acquire new lore and magical power only from the ruins of fallen civilizations and great calamities.

Nagpas still fear the Raven Queen and do their best to avoid her and her agents. When it’s impossible to do so, they become cringing, fawning things, eager to please and thereby escape further attention from her cold gaze. All the original thirteen remain alive, thanks to their cunning and their willingness to do whatever is necessary to survive.

Hungry to claim more power despite the Raven Queen’s curse, nagpas strive to bring about world-shaking destruction. From the shadows, they manipulate events to bring about ruin. They can bring to bear an array of spells to turn other creatures into their agents, influencing their decisions in subtle ways and making them unwitting accomplices in their own destruction. Nagpas are extraordinarily patient and pursue several schemes simultaneously, so if one plan goes awry, they can shift their focus to another. Typically, nagpas emerge from the shadows only when they can deliver a finishing blow. They then revel in the grand devastation their plotting brought about—looting libraries, plundering vaults, and prying secrets of arcane lore and power from the wreckage.

Actions

Multiattack. The nagpa makes three Staff or Deathly Ray attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

Staff. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 24 (7d6) necrotic damage.

Deathly Ray. Ranged Spell Attack: +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (7d6 + 6) necrotic damage.

Spellcasting. The nagpa casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 20):

At will: detect magic, mage hand, message, minor illusion

2/day each: fireball, fly, hold person, suggestion, wall of fire

1/day each: dominate person, etherealness, feeblemind

Bonus Actions

Corruption. The nagpa targets one creature it can see within 90 feet of it. The target must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. An evil creature makes the save with disadvantage. On a failed save, the target is charmed by the nagpa until the start of the nagpa’s next turn. On a successful save, the target becomes immune to the nagpa’s Corruption for the next 24 hours.

Paralysis (Recharge 6). The nagpa forces each creature within 30 feet of it to make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw, excluding Undead and Constructs. On a failed save, a target is paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


Narzugon
Paladins who make deals with devils and carry their twisted sense of honor into the afterlife are especially valuable to the archdukes of the Nine Hells. These narzugons act as horrific perversions of knights errant, carrying out their masters’ will.

Narzugons wield hell-forged lances that shunt the souls of any they killed to the River Styx for rebirth as lemures (see the Monster Manual). Every lance bears the marks of both a narzugon and its master.

Each narzugon claims a nightmare (see the Monster Manual) as its mount. These steeds are bound by infernal tack (see below) and must respond to the summons and commands of the spurs’ wearer.

Magic Item: Infernal Tack
Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Creature of Evil Alignment)

A rider binds a nightmare to its service with infernal tack, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, and stirrups, along with spurs that are worn by the rider. A nightmare equipped with infernal tack must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed.

You can use an action to call a nightmare equipped with infernal tack by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.

The tack doesn’t conjure a nightmare; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become true partners in evil.

Infernal Tack. The narzugon wears spurs that are part of infernal tack, which allow it to summon its nightmare companion as an action.

Magic Resistance. The narzugon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Multiattack. The narzugon makes three Hellfire Lance attacks. It also uses Infernal Command or Terrifying Command.

Hellfire Lance. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage plus 16 (3d10) fire damage. If this damage kills a creature with a soul, the soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure (see the Monster Manual) in Avernus in 1d4 hours. If the creature isn’t revived before then, only a wish spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature’s original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.

Infernal Command. Each ally of the narzugon within 60 feet of it can’t be charmed or frightened until the end of the narzugon’s next turn.

Terrifying Command. Each creature within 60 feet of the narzugon that isn’t a Fiend must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or become frightened of the narzugon for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that makes a successful saving throw is immune to this narzugon’s Terrifying Command for 24 hours.

Healing (1/Day). The narzugon, or one creature it touches, regains 100 hit points.


Neogi
A neogi looks like an outsize spider with an eel’s neck and head. It can poison the body and the mind of its targets and can subjugate even beings that are physically superior.

Neogi usually dwell in far-flung locations on the Material Plane, as well as in the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane. They left their home world long ago to conquer and devour creatures in other realms. During this era, they dominated umber hulks and used them to build sleek, spidery ships capable of traversing the multiverse.


Neogi Hatchling
A neogi lives about a century. When an individual is rendered weak by advanced age, the other neogi in the group overpower it and inject it with a special poison. The toxin transforms the old neogi into a bloated mass of flesh. Younger neogi lay their eggs atop it, and when the hatchlings emerge, they devour the old neogi and one another until only a few of the strongest newborns are left. The surviving neogi hatchlings begin their lives under the control of adult neogi. They must learn about their society and earn a place in it, and each one starts its training by gaining mastery over an umber hulk.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Neogi (Adult)
The mentality of neogi is alien to many other peoples. Because adult neogi have the power to control minds, they consider doing so to be entirely appropriate. Their society makes no distinction between individuals, aside from the ability that a given creature has to control others, and they don’t comprehend the emotional aspects of existence that humans and similar beings experience. To a neogi, hatred is as foreign a sensation as love, and showing loyalty in the absence of authority is foolishness.

Neogi mark themselves and those they capture through the use of dyes, transformational magic, and other markings intended to signify rank, achievements, and the identity of the individual’s leader. By these signs, neogi can identify each others’ place in the hierarchy—and they must defer to those of higher station or risk harsh punishment.

Actions

Multiattack. The neogi makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute.

The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the neogi for 1 day, or until the neogi dies or is more than 1 mile from the target. The charmed target obeys the neogi’s commands and can’t take reactions, and the neogi and the target can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up to 1 mile. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Neogi Master
Neogi masters use magic, as a result of a pact between neogi and aberrant entities they met during their journey from their home world. These entities—known by such names as Acamar, Caiphon, Gibbeth, and Hadar—resemble stars and embody the essence of evil.

Only the malevolent or the desperate do business with neogi. I generally advise against working with beings who view you as property or prey.

At will: guidance, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation

1/day each: dimension door, hold person, hunger of Hadar

Bonus Actions

Enslave (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The neogi targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the neogi for 1 day, or until the neogi dies or is more than 1 mile from the target. The charmed target obeys the neogi’s commands and can’t take reactions, and the neogi and the target can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up to 1 mile. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Neothelid
A slime-covered worm of immense size, a neothelid is the result of the mind flayer reproductive cycle gone horribly wrong. When an illithid colony collapses, typically after an external assault, and the elder brain (appears in this book) is killed, the colony’s tadpoles are suddenly freed from their fate. They no longer serve as food—and are no longer fed by their caretakers. Driven by hunger, they turn to devouring one another. Only one tadpole survives out of the thousands in the colony’s pool, and it emerges as a neothelid.

Neothelids know nothing beyond their predatory existence. They prowl subterranean passages, using their rudimentary psionic abilities to search out and incapacitate brains to sate their constant hunger, growing ever more vicious. These creatures can spray tissue-dissolving enzymes from their tentacle ducts, reducing victims to puddles of slime and leaving only the pulsing brains unharmed. They have no knowledge of their link to illithids, so they’re just as likely to prey on mind flayers as on anything else.

Mind flayers consider neothelids dangerous abominations—normally they eat or destroy any tadpoles that grow larger than a few inches in length without being implanted in a brain so they can’t become such threats. Neothelids are not intelligent enough for elder brains to detect, so mind flayers are always alert for signs of their presence and organize hunting parties to exterminate any of these murderous worms they learn of.

Creature Sense. The neothelid is aware of the presence of creatures within 1 mile of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each creature’s Intelligence score, but can’t sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a mind blank spell, a nondetection spell, or similar magic can’t be perceived in this manner.

Magic Resistance. The neothelid has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Tentacles. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10) psychic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the neothelid. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the neothelid, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the neothelid’s turns.

If the neothelid takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the neothelid must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the neothelid. If the neothelid dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Acid Breath (Recharge 5–6). The neothelid exhales acid in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Spellcasting (Psionics). The neothelid casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

At will: levitate

1/day each: confusion, feeblemind, telekinesis


Nightwalker
The Negative Plane is a place of death, anathema to all living things. Yet there are some who would tap into its fell power and use its energy for sinister ends. Most individuals prove unequal to the task. Those not destroyed outright are sometimes drawn inside the plane and replaced by nightwalkers—terrifying Undead creatures that devour all life they encounter.

One can reach the Negative Plane from the Shadowfell in places where the barrier between the planes is thin. Stepping onto the Negative Plane is almost always fatal since the plane sucks the life and soul from creatures, annihilating most at once. The few who survive by sheer luck or by harnessing some rare form of protective magic soon discover that they can’t leave as easily as they arrived.

Worse, for each creature that enters the plane, a nightwalker is released to take its place. In order for a trapped creature to escape, the released nightwalker must be lured back to the Negative Plane by offerings of life for it to devour. If the nightwalker is destroyed, the trapped creature has no hope of escape.

Generally, a nightwalker on the Material Plane is attracted to elements of the world associated with the creature responsible for its creation, which can provide clues as to who the trapped creature is. This attraction doesn’t indicate a willingness to engage with the world, though; nightwalkers exist to make life extinct, and they prioritize anything associated with the trapped creature for destruction.

Annihilating Aura. Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the nightwalker must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. Undead are immune to this aura.

Life Eater. A creature dies if reduced to 0 hit points by the nightwalker and can’t be revived except by a wish spell.

Unusual Nature. The nightwalker doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Actions

Multiattack. The nightwalker makes two Enervating Focus attacks, one of which can be replaced by Finger of Doom, if available.

Enervating Focus. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (5d8 + 6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

Finger of Doom (Recharge 6). The nightwalker points at one creature it can see within 300 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or take 39 (6d12) necrotic damage and become frightened until the end of the nightwalker’s next turn. While frightened in this way, the creature is also paralyzed. If a target’s saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the nightwalker’s Finger of Doom for the next 24 hours.


Nilbog
When Maglubiyet conquered the goblin gods, a trickster deity was determined to get the last laugh. Although Maglubiyet shattered its essence, this trickster god survives in a splintered form as possessing spirits that cause disorder unless they are appeased. Goblins have no name for this deity and dare not give it one, lest Maglubiyet use its name to ensnare and crush it as he did their other deities. They call the possessing spirit, as well as the goblin possessed by it, a nilbog (“goblin” spelled backward), and they revel in the chaos a nilbog sows.

Whenever goblinoids form a host, there is a chance that a goblin will become possessed by a nilbog, particularly if the goblins have been mistreated by their betters. The possessed goblin turns into a wisecracking, impish creature fearless of reprisal. This nilbog also gains strange powers that drive others to do the opposite of what they desire. Attacking the possessed goblin is foolhardy, and killing them just prompts the spirit to possess another goblin. The only way to keep a nilbog from wreaking havoc is to treat it well and give it respect and praise.

Among fey courts, the risk of attracting a nilbog has given rise to the practice of always including at least one goblin jester. This jester is allowed to go anywhere and do whatever they please, hopefully preventing a nilbog from manifesting. The position of jester is much sought-after among the courts’ goblins, because even if the jester is obviously not a nilbog, the court must indulge their chaotic behavior.

Nilbogism
A nilbog is an invisible spirit that possesses only goblins. When bereft of a host, the spirit has a flying speed of 30 feet, it can’t be attacked, and it is immune to all damage and conditions. Acting on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the only action it can take is to attempt to possess a goblin within 5 feet of it.

A goblin targeted by the spirit must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become possessed. While possessed, the goblin uses the nilbog stat block. If the save succeeds, the spirit can’t possess that goblin for 24 hours.

If its host is killed or the possession is ended by a spell such as hallow, magic circle, or protection from evil and good, the spirit searches for another goblin to possess. The spirit can leave its host at any time, but it won’t do so willingly unless it knows there’s another potential host nearby. A goblin stripped of their nilbog spirit reverts to their normal statistics and loses the traits they gained while possessed.

Nilbogism. Any creature that attempts to damage the nilbog must first succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be charmed until the end of the creature’s next turn. A creature charmed in this way must use its action praising the nilbog.

The nilbog can’t regain hit points, including through magical healing, except through its Reversal of Fortune reaction.

Actions

Fool’s Scepter. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

Mocking Word. The nilbog targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or take 5 (2d4) psychic damage and have disadvantage on its next attack roll before the end of its next turn.

Spellcasting. The nilbog casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

At will: mage hand, Tasha’s hideous laughter

Bonus Actions

Nimble Escape. The nilbog takes the Disengage or Hide action.

Reactions

Reversal of Fortune. In response to another creature dealing damage to the nilbog, the nilbog reduces the damage to 0 and regains 3 (1d6) hit points.


Nupperibo
No soul is turned away from the Nine Hells, but the truly worthless—those whose evil acts in life arose from carelessness and inaction more than anything else—are suitable only to become nupperibos. These pitiful creatures shuffle across the landscape, driven to purposeful action only when the clouds of swarming vermin that surround them find them prey to destroy or when a greater fiendish power commands it.

Individually, nupperibos are weak, but they’re rarely alone and can be dangerous when gathered into packs. Clouds of stinging insects, stirges (see the Monster Manual), and other vermin surround them in a terrifying, reeking sheath that torments any non-devil that draws near.

A nupperibo knows nothing but the desire to destroy non-Fiends. Once a nupperibo’s vermin cloud senses a potential meal, any nearby nupperibos pursue that prey tirelessly until it or the nupperibos are slain, or some other potential victim crosses the devils’ path and distracts them.

Nupperibos unthinkingly obey any command they receive telepathically from another devil. This blind loyalty makes them the easiest of infernal troops to lead into battle, but their presence in a legion does nothing to elevate its general’s status.

A lemure emerges from the Styx wiped of memory, yet the patterns of evil it performed in life remain indelibly inscribed upon its soul…

But those who lacked ambition cannot climb the hierarchical ladder of the Hells.

They instead step down, becoming nupperibos.

Monsters: O
Oblexes
By experimenting on the slimes, jellies, and puddings that infest the depths of the Underdark, mind flayers created a special breed of Ooze, the oblex—a slime capable of assaulting the minds of other creatures. These pools of jelly are cunning hunters that feed on thoughts and memories. The sharper the mind, the better the meal, so oblexes hunt targets more likely to be intelligent, such as wizards and other spellcasters. When suitable fare comes within reach, an oblex draws its body up to engulf its victim. As it withdraws, it plunders the creature’s mind, leaving its prey befuddled and confused—or dead.

When oblexes feed on thoughts, they can form weird copies of their prey to use as lures, which helps them harvest even more victims for their mind flayer masters.

Oblex Spawn
An oblex devours memories not only to sustain its existence, but also to spawn new oblexes. Each time it fully drains the memories of a victim, it gains the creature’s personality—now twisted by the oblex’s foul nature. The more memories an oblex steals, the larger it becomes, until it must shed a personality it has absorbed or else become uncontrolled and erratic. This act spawns a new oblex.

Newly formed oblexes lack the capabilities of their older kin. They seek only to feed on memories and grow until they can impersonate their victims.

Unusual Nature. The oblex doesn’t require sleep.

Actions

Pseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 2 (1d4) psychic damage.


Adult and Elder Oblexes
Older oblexes, called adults and elders, have eaten so many memories that they can form duplicates of the creatures they have devoured from the substance of their bodies, sending these copies off to lure prey into their clutches while remaining tethered to the slime by long tendrils of goo. These duplicated creatures are indistinguishable from their victims except for a faint sulfurous smell. Oblexes use these duplicates to lead prey into danger or to infiltrate settlements so they can feed on superior victims.

Mind flayers unleash all manner of foul experiments upon the planes with little thought for the consequences. Here, though, I suspect another influence: Juiblex.

Amorphous. The oblex can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

Aversion to Fire. If the oblex takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

Unusual Nature. The oblex doesn’t require sleep.

Actions

Multiattack. The oblex makes two Pseudopod attacks, and it uses Eat Memories.

Pseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) psychic damage.

Eat Memories. The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the greater restoration or heal spell. Constructs, Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save automatically.

While memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from its ability checks and attack rolls. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect then ends.

The oblex learns all the languages a memory-drained target knows and gains all its skill proficiencies.

Spellcasting (Psionics). The oblex casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

3/day each: charm person (as 5th-level spell), detect thoughts, hypnotic pattern

Bonus Actions

Sulfurous Impersonation. The oblex extrudes a piece of itself that assumes the appearance of one Medium or smaller creature whose memories it has stolen. This simulacrum appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. The oblex can impersonate 1d4 + 1 different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away. The simulacrum is an extension of the oblex, meaning that the oblex occupies its space and the simulacrum’s space simultaneously. The tether is immune to damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between the oblex and the simulacrum. The simulacrum disappears if the tether is severed.

An oblex wants memories, but not to serve any end of its own making. Oblexes are hungry for memories and personalities because they are empty without such nourishment. In this way they serve their creators, illithids. An oblex in the range of an elder brain’s powers provides everything necessary for the mind flayers to find choice victims.

Ogres of War
Ogres love to rush headlong into battle, but with enough time and patience, some of them learn to carry out specialized missions. The names they are given—the battering ram, the bolt launcher, the chain brute, and the howdah—reflect their particular functions. These jobs are tailored to take advantage of an ogre’s strengths.

Ogre Battering Ram
An ogre battering ram carries an enormous club that’s primarily used for bashing doors into kindling but also works well for smashing foes. These ogres are drilled in two simple tasks: rushing forward to shatter enemy fortifications and using their weapons to force an advancing enemy to halt.

Siege Monster. The ogre deals double damage to objects and structures.

Actions

Multiattack. The ogre makes two Bash attacks.

Bash. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the ogre can push the target 5 feet away if the target is a Huge or smaller creature.

Reactions

Block the Path. When a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the ogre, the ogre makes a Bash attack against that creature. If the attack hits, the target’s speed is reduced to 0 until the start of the ogre’s next turn.


Ogre Bolt Launcher
A bolt launcher carries a gigantic crossbow—a weapon so large it’s essentially an ogre-held ballista. An ogre bolt launcher can load this immense weapon and loose its deadly missile as quickly as a dwarf handles a crossbow. The bolts are so large that few ogres can carry more than a half dozen at a time, but bolt launchers have been known to uproot small trees or tear beams out of buildings and launch those when their ammunition runs low.

Ogre Chain Brute
An ogre chain brute wields a great spiked chain, swinging it with both hands in a wide circle to knock foes off their feet. Alternatively, the ogre can swing the chain in a crushing overhead smash.

Chain Smash (Recharge 6). Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target repeats the saving throw if it takes damage and at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Chain Sweep. The ogre swings its chain, and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

Ogre Howdah
The most unusual of the specialized ogres, the howdah carries a palisaded wooden fort on its back. The fort serves as a fighting platform for up to four Small people. Ogre howdahs are most often seen bearing bow- and spear-wielding goblins into battle, or perhaps kobolds or deep gnomes (all three appear in the Monster Manual), but they might also transport other Small folk.

Howdah. The ogre carries a compact fort on its back. Up to four Small creatures can ride in the fort without squeezing. To make a melee attack against a target within 5 feet of the ogre, they must use spears or weapons with reach. Creatures in the fort have three-quarters cover against attacks and effects from outside it. If the ogre dies, creatures in the fort are placed in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the ogre.

Actions

Fist. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.


Oinoloth
Grim specters of death, oinoloths bring pestilence wherever they go. When armies recognize their awful forms, their mere appearance causes soldiers to break ranks and flee, lest they succumb to one of the awful plagues that oinoloths let loose.

Oinoloths solve thorny problems by killing everyone involved. They are typically hired as a last resort when a siege has gone on too long or an army has proven too strong to overcome. Once summoned, oinoloths stalk the killing field, poisoning the ground and sickening creatures they encounter. Sometimes they might be hired to lift the very plagues they spread, but the price for such work is high, and the effort turns the creatures they save into debilitated wrecks.

Magic Resistance. The oinoloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Multiattack. The oinoloth makes two Claw attacks, and it uses Spellcasting or Teleport.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 22 (4d10) necrotic damage.

Corrupted Healing (Recharge 6). The oinoloth touches one willing creature within 5 feet of it. The target regains all its hit points. In addition, the oinoloth can end one disease on the target or remove one of the following conditions from it: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. The target then gains 1 level of exhaustion, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 7 (2d6). This reduction can be removed only by a wish spell or by casting greater restoration on the target three times within the same hour. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

Spellcasting. The oinoloth casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

At will: darkness, detect magic, dispel magic, hold monster, invisibility (self only)

1/day each: feeblemind, globe of invulnerability

Teleport. The oinoloth teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

Bonus Actions

Bringer of Plagues (Recharge 5–6). The oinoloth blights the area in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. The blight lasts for 24 hours. While the area is blighted, all normal plants there wither and die.

Furthermore, when a creature moves into the blighted area or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is poisoned. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the oinoloth’s Bringer of Plagues for the next 24 hours.

The poisoned creature can’t regain hit points. After every 24 hours that elapse, the poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). This reduction lasts until the poison ends, and the target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. The poison ends after the creature successfully saves against it three times.


Orcus

Orcus is the Demon Prince of Undeath, also known as the Blood Lord. While he takes pleasure in the sufferings of the living, he far prefers the company and service of Undead. His desire is to see all life quenched and the multiverse transformed into a vast necropolis populated solely by Undead creatures under his command.

Orcus rewards those who spread death in his name by granting them a small portion of his power. The least of these become ghouls and zombies (both appear in the Monster Manual) that serve in his legions, while his favored servants are the cultists and necromancers who murder the living and then manipulate the dead, emulating their dread master.

Orcus is a bestial creature of corruption with a diseased, decaying look. He has the lower torso of a goat and a humanlike upper body with a belly swollen with rot. Great bat wings sprout from his shoulders, and his head is like the skull of a goat, the flesh nearly rotted from it. In one hand, he wields the legendary Wand of Orcus, which is described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Orcus fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Resistance. Orcus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Master of Undeath. Orcus can cast animate dead (at will) and create undead (3/day). He chooses the level at which the spells are cast, and the creatures created by them remain under his control indefinitely. Additionally, he can cast create undead even when it isn’t night.

Special Equipment. Orcus wields the Wand of Orcus.

Actions

Multiattack. Orcus makes three Wand of Orcus, Tail, or Necrotic Bolt attacks.

Wand of Orcus. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d8 + 11) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (2d12) necrotic damage.

Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) force damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.

Necrotic Bolt. Ranged Spell Attack: +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 29 (5d8 + 7) necrotic damage.

Conjure Undead (1/Day). While holding the Wand of Orcus, Orcus conjures Undead creatures whose combined average hit points don’t exceed 500. These creatures magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of Orcus and obey his commands until they are destroyed or until he dismisses them as an action.

Spellcasting. Orcus casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 23):

At will: detect magic

3/day: dispel magic

1/day: time stop

Wand Spellcasting. While holding the Wand of Orcus, Orcus casts one of the following spells (spell save DC 18), some of which require charges; the wand has 7 charges to fuel these spells, and it regains 1d4 + 3 charges daily at dawn:

At will: animate dead (as an action), blight, speak with dead

1 charge each: circle of death, finger of death

2 charges: power word kill

Legendary Actions

Orcus can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Orcus regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

Attack. Orcus makes one Tail or Necrotic Bolt attack.

Creeping Death (Costs 2 Actions). Orcus chooses a point on the ground that he can see within 100 feet of him. A cylinder of swirling necrotic energy 60 feet tall and with a 10-foot radius rises from that point and lasts until the end of Orcus’s next turn. Creatures in that area have vulnerability to necrotic damage.

Orcus’s Lair
Orcus makes his lair in the fortress city of Naratyr, which is on Thanatos, the layer of the Abyss that he rules. Surrounded by a moat fed by the River Styx, Naratyr is an eerily quiet and cold city, its streets empty for hours at a time. The central castle of bone has interior walls of flesh and carpets made of woven hair. The city contains wandering Undead, many of which are engaged in continuous battles with one another.

Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Orcus can take one of the following lair actions; he can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

Deadly Utterance. Orcus’s voice booms throughout the lair. His utterance causes one creature of his choice to be subjected to power word kill. Orcus needn’t see the creature, but he must be aware that the individual is in the lair.

Grasp of the Dead. Orcus causes skeletal arms to rise from an area on the ground in a 20-foot square that he can see. They last until the next initiative count 20. Each creature in that area when the arms appear must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be restrained until the arms disappear or until Orcus releases them (no action required).

Undead Servants. Orcus causes up to six corpses within the lair to rise as skeletons, zombies, or ghouls (all appear in the Monster Manual). These Undead obey his telepathic commands, which can reach anywhere in the lair.

Regional Effects
The region containing Orcus’s lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

Charnel Realm. The air is filled with the stench of rotting flesh, and buzzing flies grow thick within the region.

Undead Beasts. Dead Beasts periodically animate as Undead mockeries of their former selves. Skeletal and zombie versions of local wildlife are commonly seen in the area.

If Orcus dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

Cultists of Orcus
Orcus grants his rank-and-file cultists the Undying Soul trait, and his cult leaders can gain the Aura of Death trait.

Undying Soul (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). If this creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it immediately makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, it is instead reduced to 1 hit point.

Aura of Death. This creature emanates a deathly aura that extends 30 feet in every direction from its space while it isn’t incapacitated. The aura is blocked by total cover. While in the aura, the creature and any friendly Undead are immune to the frightened condition and have resistance to radiant damage. Enemies have disadvantage on death saving throws while in the aura.

Orthon
When an archduke of the Nine Hells needs a creature tracked, found, and either done away with or captured, the task usually falls to an orthon. These devils are infernal bounty hunters, tireless in their pursuit of their quarry across the multiverse.

Orthons are infamous for their sharp senses. Because an orthon can become invisible at will, its quarry is often unaware of being hunted until the orthon strikes. This invisibility can be disrupted when the devil is attacked, however, so a strong counterattack is often the best defense against it.

Orthons value the challenge of the chase and the thrill of one-on-one combat above all else. An orthon’s first loyalty is to its archduke, but one with no immediate assignment might work for anyone who promises it a worthy struggle against a lethal foe. Because they travel widely, orthons are unequaled as guides through the layers of the Nine Hells.

Magic Resistance. The orthon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Infernal Dagger. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d4 + 6) force damage, and the target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failure, the target is also poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Brass Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) force damage. The target also suffers one of the following effects of the orthon’s choice; the orthon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

Acid. The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Blindness. The target takes 5 (1d10) radiant damage. In addition, the target and each creature within 20 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the orthon’s next turn.
Concussion. The target and each creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (2d12) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Entanglement. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained for 1 hour by strands of sticky webbing. The target can escape by taking an action to make a DC 17 Strength or Dexterity check and succeeding.
Paralysis. The target takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Tracking. For the next 24 hours, the orthon knows the direction and distance to the target, as long as it’s on the same plane of existence. If the target is on a different plane, the orthon knows which one, but not the exact location there.
Bonus Actions

Invisibility Field (Recharge 4–6). The orthon becomes invisible. Any equipment it wears or carries is also invisible as long as the equipment is on its person. This invisibility ends immediately after it makes an attack roll or is hit by an attack roll.

Reactions

Explosive Retribution. In response to dropping to 15 hit points or fewer, the orthon explodes. All other creatures within 30 feet of it must each make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The orthon, its infernal dagger, and its brass crossbow are destroyed.


Monsters: P
Phoenix
To rise like a phoenix from the ashes—so many use that quaint colloquialism. Little do they know about the true horror of such a rebirth.

—Mordenkainen

Releasing a phoenix from the Inner Planes creates an explosion of fire that spreads across the sky. An enormous fiery bird forms in the center of the flames and smoke—an elder Elemental possessed by a need to burn everything to ash. The phoenix rarely stays in one place for long as it strives to transform the world into an inferno.

Fiery Death and Rebirth. If the phoenix dies, it explodes. Each creature in 60-foot-radius sphere centered on the phoenix must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

The explosion destroys the phoenix’s body and leaves behind an egg-shaped cinder, which weighs 5 pounds. The cinder deals 21 (6d6) fire damage to any creature that touches it, though no more than once per round. The cinder is immune to all damage, and after 1d6 days, it hatches a new phoenix.

Fire Form. The phoenix can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

Any creature that touches the phoenix or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the phoenix can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature’s space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage.

With a touch, the phoenix can also ignite flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried (no action required).

Flyby. The phoenix doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.

Illumination. The phoenix sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the phoenix fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Siege Monster. The phoenix deals double damage to objects and structures.

Quickling
Quicklings rocket through twisted forests where the unseelie fey hold sway, both in the Feywild and in the world. These slender Fey resemble miniature elves with feral features and cold eyes that gleam like jewels. Racing faster than the eye can track, they appear as little more than blurry waverings in the air.

Quicklings owe their existence—and their plight—to the Queen of Air and Darkness, the dread ruler of the Gloaming Court. Once a species of lazy and egotistical Fey, quicklings’ predecessors were late in answering the queen’s summons one time too many. To hasten their pace and teach them to mind her will, the queen sped up their internal clocks and shrank them. Her curse gave quicklings amazing speed but also accelerated their passage through life—no quickling lives longer than fifteen years.

The mortal realm is a ponderous place to a quickling’s eye: a hurricane creeps gradually across the sky, a torrent of rain drifts earthward like lazy snowflakes, lightning crawls in a meandering path from cloud to cloud. The slow and boring world seems to be populated by torpid creatures whose deep, mooing speech lacks meaning.

To other creatures, quicklings seem blindingly fast, vanishing into an indistinct blur as they move. Their cruel laughter is a burst of rapid staccato sounds, their speech a shrill squeal. Only when quicklings deliberately slow down, which they prefer not to do, can other beings properly see, hear, and comprehend them. Never truly at rest, “stationary” quicklings constantly pace and shift in place, as though they can’t wait to be off again.

Quicklings have a capricious nature that goes well with their energy level: they think as fast as they run, and they are always up to something. They spend most of their time perpetrating acts of mischief on slower creatures. One rarely passes up an opportunity to tie a person’s bootlaces together, move the stool a creature is about to sit on, or unbuckle a saddle while no one’s looking.

Tricks of that sort are hardly the limit of quicklings’ artful malice, however. They don’t commit outright murder, but they can ruin lives in plenty of other ways: stealing an important letter, swiping coins collected for the poor, planting a stolen item in someone’s bag. Quicklings enjoy causing suffering that transcends mere mischief, especially when the blame for their actions falls on others and creates discord.

Blurred Movement. Attack rolls against the quickling have disadvantage unless it is incapacitated or its speed is 0.

Monsters: R
Redcap
A redcap is a homicidal Fey creature born of blood lust. Redcaps, although small, have formidable strength, which they use to hunt and kill without hesitation or regret.

In the Feywild, or where that plane touches the material world at a fey crossing, if a sentient creature acts on an intense desire for bloodshed, one or more redcaps might appear where the blood of a slain person soaks the ground. At first, new redcaps look like tiny bloodstained mushrooms just pushing their caps out of the soil. When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that resembles a wizened and undersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap, clothing of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment redcaps awaken, they desire only murder and carnage, and they constantly seek to satisfy these cravings.

Redcaps lack subtlety. They live for direct confrontation and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, the creature’s iron boots force them to take ponderous, thunderous steps. When a redcap is near potential prey, though, they can close the distance quickly and get in a vicious swing of their weapon before the target can react.

Redcaps’ desire to slay is rooted in their will to survive. To sustain their unnatural existence, they must soak their hats in the fresh blood of their victims. When redcaps are born, their hats are coated with wet blood, and they know that if the blood isn’t replenished at least once every three days, they will vanish as if they had never been.

Some redcaps can sense the being whose murderous acts led to their birth. They typically use this innate connection to find their creator and make that creature their first victim, though they might instead seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. Although redcaps don’t usually operate in groups, an individual responsible for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, emulating that individual’s murderous handiwork. Some hags and wicked mages know methods to call redcaps out of the Feywild and might likewise put teams of them to work as grisly servants.

In any case, if a redcap works with another being, the redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patron who tries to stifle a redcap’s natural and necessary urge for blood risks becoming the redcap’s next target.

Retriever
The retriever is a potent, spider-like Construct conceived and built by Underdark followers of Lolth for one original purpose—to prowl the Abyss and capture demons for these cultists to enslave or use in their rituals. The automatons proved so effective and so fearsome that they now perform many different missions.

Though retrievers were created to operate only in the Abyss, they are sometimes dispatched when a powerful devotee of Lolth needs some creature or object captured and brought back alive and intact. Only under the rarest of circumstances is a retriever handed over or sold to others, since Lolth’s cultists don’t want to take the chance that their creations will be turned against them.

Faultless Tracker. The retriever is given a quarry by its master. The quarry can be a specific creature or object the master is personally acquainted with, or it can be a general type of creature or object the master has seen before. The retriever knows the direction and distance to its quarry as long as the two of them are on the same plane of existence. The retriever can have only one such quarry at a time. The retriever also always knows the location of its master.

Actions

Multiattack. The retriever makes two Foreleg attacks, and it uses Force Beam or Paralyzing Beam, if available.

Foreleg. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage.

Force Beam. The retriever targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Paralyzing Beam (Recharge 5–6). The retriever targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If the paralyzed creature is Medium or smaller, the retriever can pick it up as part of the retriever’s move and walk or climb with it at full speed.

Spellcasting. The retriever casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

3/day each: plane shift (only self and up to one incapacitated creature, which is considered willing for the spell), web


Rutterkin
Rutterkins are warped demons that roam the Abyss in mobs, constantly searching for intruders to surround and devour. These Fiends protect the Abyss from non-demons. When they spot any interlopers, they gather in a crowd and surge forward, emitting a wave of fear in advance of their attacks that leaves their victims terrified and rooted in place.

Creatures bitten by rutterkins are exposed to a terrible disease that infects them with the corrupting influence of the Abyss. Victims afflicted with the disease experience tremendous pain as their bodies become disfigured, flesh twisting around the bones, until they transform to join the mass of manes demons (see the Monster Manual) that follow in the wake of the rutterkin mob that laid them low.

Challenge 2 (450 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2

Immobilizing Fear. When a creature that isn’t a demon starts its turn within 30 feet of one or more rutterkins, that creature must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. The creature has disadvantage on the save if it’s within 30 feet of six or more rutterkins. On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened of the rutterkins for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the creature is restrained. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the Crippling Fear of all rutterkins for 24 hours.

Actions

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (3d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned. At the end of each long rest, the poisoned target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points while poisoned in this way, it dies and instantly transforms into a living manes (see the Monster Manual). The transformation can be undone only by a wish spell.
