#### Description
The orange slaad are slaad that are infused with chaos and fire, born when a green slaad transforms not into a gray, but into something born of heat and ash. Like the gray, orange can only ascend to become death slaadi by consuming the corpse of a death slaadi, so like the gray, orange slaadi choose a death slaad to serve in exchange for the opportunity to become a death slaadi. However, some orange slaadi can also ascend by consuming one of their cousin-kin (the brown, indigo, or cyan), though it's not consistent as to when or how.

In their natural form, orange slaadi are ...

Like the gray, brown can only ascend to become death slaadi by consuming the corpse of a death slaadi, so like the gray, brown slaadi choose a death slaad to serve in exchange for the opportunity to become a death slaadi. However, some brown slaadi can also ascend by consuming one of their cousin-kin (the orange, indigo, or cyan), though it's not consistent as to when or how.

In their normal form, brown slaadi are ...

Brown slaadi are some of the least chaotic slaadi in their temperament and actions, but when they act, they often do so determinedly and unwaveringly, heedless of the outcome. Browns are often desirable to death slaadi as underlings, as they will resolutely carry out whatever mission they are assigned, but often they lack creativity to work around obstacles--they'd rather plow right through them.

A white slaad summons 1d6 red slaad, 1d4 blue slaad, 1d2 green slaad, or one gray slaad with no chance of failure. Any summoned slaad appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other slaad. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

#### Actions
**Multiattack.** The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws or greatsword.

While infected, the target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 3 (1d6) at the end of the creatures turn. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a red slaad or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad. Only a wish spell can reverse the transformation.

#### Description
If a [death slaad](#death-slaad) journeys to the Ethereal and remains there for long enough, it begins a slow transition of color to white. At some point, the transition suddenly catalyzes the death slaad into a white slaad.

The white slaadi are also known as the chronos slaadi, due to their chaotic interference of time itself, which not only allows it to call forth itself from another point in its timeline, but gives it an uncanny awareness of events just before they occur. This ability to affect time has the effect of making the white slaad distant and unpredictable, even for slaadi.

The white slaad are obsessed with spreading chaos, seeding disruption where it will have the maximum effect, spreading and spreading far beyond the original act.

Many white slaad believe that the Spawning Stone was not created by Primus, but rather that the eldest slaad masters, Ygorl and Ssendam created it to impose structure on the creation of new slaad, to prevent the possibility that the chaos of Limbo might one day create a slaad more powerful than themselves. For this reason, white slaad and the slaad lords are often opposed in purpose.

**Regeneration (Cost 2 Actions).** The slaad heals 26 (4d8 + 8) hit points.

**Magic Breaker (Cost 3 Actions).** The slaad uses its Magic Breaker attack.

#### Description
Save for the great slaad masters themselves, no beings embody the raw destructive power of chaos like black slaadi. Beings of pure entropy, black slaadi appear as a toad-shaped blot of utter darkness from which its two diamond eyes gleam. It is not clear how black slaadi come into being, but it is rumored that death slaadi are transformed into black slaadi only by the will of the Slaad Lords.

Black slaadi are an enigma, for little has been written on these vastly powerful beings. They wander the Maelstrom, pursuing inscrutable goals and spreading wanton destruction for ends that make sense only in their insane minds. A handful of black slaadi serve as emissaries for the great slaad masters, but most are too devoted to chaos to bend the knee to another being. Many will cultivate slaadi minions, but often black slaad are too chaotic and entropic to hold on to any structure for long, and often wander off on their own, leaving white and death slaadi to battle for control of what they have abandoned.

d6 | Result
-- | ------
 1 | **Alternate.** The Slaad temporary has other ideas in its head. Maybe it believes in peace, religion, unifying its people. The DM is free to make whatever drive is suitable, though it never lasts.
2-5| **Spread.** The Slaad will attack a viable target to spread its eggs, and will switch targets after accomplishing the goal. Slaad will ignore creatures that cannot carry their eggs.
 6 | **Destroy.** The Slaad attempts to kill any non-Slaad creature it can see.

**Form** Slaads can have fins, gills, wings, multiple legs, and vary greatly in size. At the beginning of an encounter, roll a d6 and check this chart

#### Description
Chaos slaadi are slaad who have been entirely subverted by the chaos of Chaos itself, and fall entirely outside the usual taxonomy of the slaad. For this reason, chaos slaadi are entirely unpredictable, even to another slaad, and often chaos slaadi will break out into attacks on other slaadi just as often as they work with them. The gestation and lifecyle of chaos slaadi are entirely unknown, as are their goals or intentions. Chaos slaadi are being of pure instinct, and that instinct is fickle. They don't build organizations, they don't make alliances, they don't sneak around pretending to be humanoids, they are a viral plague upon the multiverse, left unchecked they become an unstoppable legion.

#### DM Notes
* Rolls Instinct and Form at the beginning of the encounter. This highlights that you can never predict what a Slaad you meet will look or act like. Even the Slaad you saw 10 minutes ago may now be completely different. However, we assume this to be constant for a single encounter, to take some burden off the DM.
* Entropic Resistance can be rolled multiple times, but the results for a given type are kept for the whole encounter. This was my favorite new ability, and it really threw my party for a loop when they encountered it the first time. It really shakes up a fight, sometimes your favorite weapons are useless. Other times you get to enjoy vulnerability (which is critically underused in 5e), to give players some joy when a Slaad that has ridiculous power in other areas....is crazy vulnerable to the fire mages blast.
* Children of Chaos allows us to mimic constantly changing stats without so much book work. Nothing is certain, not even saving throw DCs!
* With Regeneration, we left the HP static, using this mechanic to showcase variable resiliency for the Slaad. I also wanted to keep in some notion of Slaad evolution or improvement, so I used the idea that once a Slaad is killed there is a small chance (1 in 1,296 to be precise) that it becomes a Greater Slaad (aka Death Slaad). That helps both the random fun of Slaad, but also help explain how Death Slaad emerge in the culture.

## Gormeel

Periodically, slaadi experience such degrees of chaos that they leave chaos altogether behind and find their nature instead suffused by law.
