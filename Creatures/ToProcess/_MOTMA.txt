BESTIARY (E-K)
Chapter 2: Bestiary

This bestiary provides game statistics and lore for more than 250 monsters, which are suitable for any D&D campaign. The chapter includes old favorites from past editions of the game as well as creatures created for the current edition.

This chapter is a companion to the Monster Manual and adopts a similar presentation. If you are unfamiliar with the monster stat block format, read the introduction of the Monster Manual before proceeding further. It explains stat block terminology and gives rules for various monster traits—information that isn’t repeated here.

The creatures in this bestiary are organized alphabetically. A few are gathered under a group heading; for example, the “Dinosaurs” section contains stat blocks for various dinosaurs.

Herein you will find some weapons that deal unusual damage types and spellcasting that functions in atypical ways. Such an exception is a special feature of a monster and represents how it uses the weapon or casts its spells; the exception has no affect on how a weapon or a spell functions for someone else.

Finally, if a stat block contains the name of a class in the monster’s name or in parentheses under the name, the monster is considered a member of that class for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for magic items.

My friend Mordenkainen constantly fights monsters and makes notes about them. I love notes as much as the next wizard, but fighting gets old. Why not sit down and have a drink with the monster? I’ve learned the most delicious secrets from my monstrous drinking companions. The other monsters? I disintegrated them.

TASHA

Monsters: A
Abishais
Each abishai was once a mortal who somehow won Tiamat’s favor before death and, as a reward, found its soul transformed into a draconic devil to serve at her pleasure in the Nine Hells. Each type of abishai is associated with one of Tiamat’s five dragon heads: black, blue, green, red, and white.

Tiamat deploys abishais as her agents, sending them forth to represent her interests in the Hells and across the multiverse. Some have simple tasks, such as delivering a message to cultists. Others have greater responsibilities, such as leading large groups, assassinating targets, and serving in armies. In all cases, abishais are fanatically loyal to Tiamat, ready to lay down their lives if needed.

Abishais stand outside the normal hierarchy of the Nine Hells, having their own chain of command and ultimately answering to Tiamat (and Asmodeus, when he chooses to use them). Other archdevils can command abishais to work for them, but most archdevils do so rarely, since it is never clear whether an abishai follows Tiamat’s orders or Asmodeus’s. There is inherent risk in countermanding an order given by Tiamat, but interfering with Asmodeus’s plans invites certain destruction.

Black Abishai
Expert assassins and infiltrators, black abishais can weave shadows to mask their presence, allowing them to reach a location where they can deliver a fatal strike to their targets.

At will: alter self, major image

3/day each: charm person, detect thoughts, fear

Red Abishai
Red abishais have no equals among the abishais when it comes to leadership ability and raw power. Red abishais lead other devils into battle or take charge of troublesome cults to ensure that they continue to carry out Tiamat’s commands. A red abishai cuts a fearsome figure, and that sight can be inspiring to the abishai’s allies, filling them with a fanatical willingness to fight.

Devil’s Sight. Magical darkness doesn’t impede the abishai’s darkvision.

Magic Resistance. The abishai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Multiattack. The abishai makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack, and it can use Frightful Presence or Incite Fanaticism.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 38 (7d10) fire damage.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) force damage plus 11 (2d10) fire damage.

Frightful Presence. Each creature of the abishai’s choice that is within 120 feet and aware of the abishai must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the abishai’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

Incite Fanaticism. The abishai chooses up to four other creatures within 60 feet of it that can see it. Until the start of the abishai’s next turn, each of those creatures makes attack rolls with advantage and can’t be frightened.

Power of the Dragon Queen. The abishai targets one Dragon it can see within 120 feet of it. The Dragon must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. A chromatic dragon makes this save with disadvantage. On a successful save, the target is immune to the abishai’s Power of the Dragon Queen for 1 hour. On a failed save, the target is charmed by the abishai for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, the target regards the abishai as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect ends if the abishai or its companions deal damage to the target.


White Abishai
White abishais fight with a reckless fury, making them ideally suited for bolstering the ranks of Tiamat’s armies. White abishais fight without fear, becoming whirlwinds of destruction on the battlefield.

Magic Resistance. The abishai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Reckless. At the start of its turn, the abishai can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

Reactions

Vicious Reprisal. In response to taking damage, the abishai makes one Bite attack against a random creature within 5 feet of it. If no creature is within reach, the abishai moves up to half its speed toward an enemy it can see, without provoking opportunity attacks.


Alhoon
Mind flayers that pursue arcane magic are exiled as deviants, and for them no everlasting communion with an elder brain (appears in this book) is possible. The road to lichdom offers an alternative way to escape the permanency of death, but that path is long and fraught with barriers. Alhoons are mind flayers who have used a shortcut to attain a lich-like state.

Elder brains forbid mind flayers from pursuing magic power aside from psionics, but it isn’t an interdiction they must often enforce. Illithids brook no masters but members of their own kind, so it isn’t in their nature to bow to any god or otherworldly patron. However, wizardry remains a temptation. In the pages of a spellbook, an illithid sees a system to acquire authority. Through the writings of the wizard who penned it, the illithid perceives the workings of a highly intelligent mind. Most mind flayers who find a spellbook react with abhorrence or indifference, but for some, a spellbook is a gateway to a new way of thinking.

For a time, the study of such forbidden texts can be hidden from other illithids and even from an elder brain. Yet eventually, mind flayer arcanists determined to pursue wizardry must flee the colony for their own safety. Once they taste freedom from the colony, some prize their privacy, others seek to commune with similar minds, and still others seek to dominate a colony by elevating themselves to the position of leadership normally held by an elder brain. Regardless, all such arcanists face the same stark fact: when they die, they will not join the host of minds in the elder brain—deviant minds are never accepted as part of the collective. For them, death means oblivion.

Lichdom offers salvation and the prospect of being able to pursue knowledge indefinitely. Yet learning the secret of achieving lichdom requires an arcane spellcaster to be at the apex of power—a significant challenge for mind flayers, given the scarcity of available mentors and training.

Confronting this reality, a group of nine mind flayer arcanists used their arcane magic and psionics to weave a new truth. These nine called themselves the Alhoon, and those who follow in their footsteps are referred to by the same name.

Collaborative Undeath
To become alhoons, mind flayer arcanists must cooperate in the creation of a periapt of mind trapping, a fist-sized container made of silver, emerald, and amethyst. The process requires at least three mind flayer arcanists and the sacrifice of an equal number of souls from living victims in a three-day-long ritual of spellcasting and psionic communion. Upon its completion, free-willed undeath is conferred on the mind flayers, turning them into alhoons.

Initially, an alhoon can be difficult to distinguish from a normal mind flayer. The most obvious difference is the lack of a mind flayer’s ever-present mucus coating. Without that protection, an alhoon’s skin becomes dry and cracked, and its eyes might appear shriveled and sunken. Both of these clues are easily missed by someone who hasn’t seen a mind flayer. However, in short order, an alhoon’s flesh withers away and its empty eye sockets gleam with cold pinpricks of light like those of other liches.

Unlike a true lich’s phylactery, the periapt of mind trapping doesn’t restore the alhoons to undeath if they are destroyed. Instead, a destroyed alhoon’s mind is transferred to the periapt, where it remains in communion with any other trapped alhoon minds, as well as the souls of those sacrificed.

The undeath conferred by a periapt of mind trapping lasts only so long as the life of the living victim selected. Thus an alhoon who sacrificed a 200-year-old elf looks forward to a much longer existence than one that sacrificed a 35-year-old person. Alhoons can extend their existence by repeating the ritual with new victims, effectively resetting the clocks for themselves.

Destroying a periapt of mind trapping consigns those trapped within it to oblivion, and thus alhoons often work together to create elaborate protections for their periapt and their preferred ritual site. Sometimes a single alhoon is entrusted with the periapt of mind trapping, but this is a dangerous proposition. Anyone who holds the periapt gains advantage on attacks, saving throws, and checks against the alhoons associated with its creation, and those alhoons in turn suffer disadvantage on attacks, saving throws, and checks against the holder. In addition, the holder can telepathically communicate with any sacrificed soul trapped within, and alhoons within the periapt can speak telepathically with the holder. A creature carrying the periapt can’t prevent communication from alhoons but can silence trapped souls.

Challenge 10 (5,900 XP) Proficiency Bonus +4

Magic Resistance. The alhoon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Turn Resistance. The alhoon has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns Undead.

Actions

Multiattack. The alhoon makes two Chilling Grasp or Arcane Bolt attacks.

Chilling Grasp. Melee Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) cold damage, and the alhoon regains 14 hit points.

Arcane Bolt. Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (8d6) force damage.

Mind Blast (Recharge 5–6). The alhoon magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (4d8 + 4) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Spellcasting. The alhoon casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

At will: dancing lights, detect magic, detect thoughts, disguise self, mage hand, prestidigitation

1/day each: dominate monster, globe of invulnerability, invisibility, modify memory, plane shift (self only), wall of force

Reactions

Negate Spell (3/Day). The alhoon targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, the spell fails, but any spell slots or charges are not wasted.


There are many reasons to avoid the way of the lich. An impermanent solution is paradoxical. Take alhoons. They require souls to keep from shriveling. I fail to see the appeal.

—Mordenkainen

Alkilith
An alkilith is easily mistaken for some kind of foul fungal growth that appears on doorways, windows, and other portals. These dripping infestations conceal the demonic nature of the alkilith, making what should be a dire warning appear strange but otherwise innocuous. Wherever alkiliths take root, they weaken the fabric of reality, creating a portal through which even nastier demons can invade.

The appearance of an alkilith in the world heralds a great wrongness and an imminent catastrophe. An alkilith searches for an aperture such as a window or a door around which it can take root, stretching its body around the opening and anchoring itself with a sticky secretion. If left undisturbed, the opening becomes attuned to the Abyss and eventually becomes a portal to that plane (see “Planar Portals” in the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

Alkiliths spring from cast-off bits of the hideous, shuddering body of Juiblex (appears in this book). They gradually become self-aware and seek to find their way onto the Material Plane. Since most cultists consider them too risky to summon—they can, after all, create portals to the Abyss—alkiliths must find other escape routes out of their native plane.

Challenge 11 (7,200 XP) Proficiency Bonus +4

Abyssal Rift. If the alkilith surrounds a door, window, or similar opening continuously for 6d6 days, the opening becomes a permanent portal to a random layer of the Abyss.

Amorphous. The alkilith can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

False Appearance. If the alkilith is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn’t observed the alkilith move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the alkilith isn’t ordinary slime or fungus.

Foment Confusion. Any creature that isn’t a demon that starts its turn within 30 feet of the alkilith must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, or it hears a faint buzzing in its head for a moment and has disadvantage on its next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.

If the saving throw against Foment Confusion fails by 5 or more, the creature is instead subjected to the confusion spell for 1 minute (no concentration required by the alkilith). While under the effect of that confusion, the creature is immune to Foment Confusion.

Magic Resistance. The alkilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Spider Climb. The alkilith can climb difficult surfaces, such as upside down on ceilings, without making an ability check.

Unusual Nature. The alkilith doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Actions

Multiattack. The alkilith makes three Tentacle attacks.

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d6 + 4) acid damage.


Allip
When a creature uncovers a secret that a powerful being has protected with a mighty curse, the result is often the creation of an allip. Secrets protected in this manner range in scope from a demon lord’s true name to the hidden truths of the cosmic order. The creature acquires the secret, but the curse annihilates its body and leaves behind a spectral being composed of fragments from the victim’s psyche and overwhelming psychic agony.

Every allip is wracked with a horrifying insight that torments what remains of its mind. In the presence of other creatures, an allip seeks to relieve this burden by sharing its secret. The creature can impart only a shard of the knowledge that doomed it, but that piece is enough to wrack the recipient with temporary mental anguish and violent compulsions. The survivors of an allip’s attack are sometimes left with a compulsion to learn more about what spawned this monstrosity. Strange phrases echo through their minds, and weird visions occupy their dreams. The sense that some colossal truth sits just outside their recall plagues them for days, months, and sometimes years after their fateful encounter.

Insidious Lore
An allip might attempt to share its lore to escape its curse and enter the afterlife. It can transfer knowledge from its mind by guiding another creature to write down what it knows. This process takes days or possibly weeks. An allip can accomplish this task by lurking in the study or workplace of a scholar. If the allip remains hidden, its victim is gradually overcome by frantic energy. A scholar, driven by sudden insights to work night and day, produces reams of text with little memory of exactly what the documents contain. If the allip succeeds, it passes from the world—and its terrible secret hides somewhere in the scholar’s text, waiting to be discovered by its next victim.

Incorporeal Movement. The allip can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

Unusual Nature. The allip doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Actions

Maddening Touch. Melee Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) psychic damage.

Howling Babble (Recharge 6). Each creature within 30 feet of the allip that can hear it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 12 (2d8 + 3) psychic damage, and it is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned. Constructs and Undead are immune to this effect.

Whispers of Compulsion. The allip chooses up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, or it takes 12 (2d8 + 3) psychic damage and must use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against one creature of the allip’s choice that the allip can see. Constructs and Undead are immune to this effect.


Amnizu
Amnizus lead infernal legions into battle and command guardians at the gateways to the Hells. Amnizus are arrogant, bullying, and ruthless, but they’re also highly intelligent tacticians and unfailingly loyal—qualities the hellish archdukes value.

Some amnizus perform the critical task of watching over the River Styx from fortresses along the river’s blighted banks, where it flows through Dis and Stygia. They collect the souls arriving in the form of lemures (see the Monster Manual). Lemures have no personalities or memories; they’re driven only by the desire to commit evil. The amnizus that patrol here drill the rules of the Nine Hells into the new arrivals’ minds and marshal them into legions.

Variant: Devil Summoning
Some amnizus have an action that allows them to summon other devils:

Summon Devil (1/Day). The amnizu summons 2d4 bearded devils or 1d4 barbed devils (both appear in the Monster Manual). A summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the amnizu, acts as an ally of the amnizu, and can’t summon other devils. It remains for 1 minute, until the amnizu dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

Devil’s Sight. Magical darkness doesn’t impede the amnizu’s darkvision.

Magic Resistance. The amnizu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Multiattack. The amnizu uses Blinding Rot or Forgetfulness, if available. It also makes two Taskmaster Whip attacks.

Taskmaster Whip. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 16 (3d10) force damage.

Blinding Rot. The amnizu targets one or two creatures that it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (4d12) necrotic damage and be blinded until the start of the amnizu’s next turn.

Forgetfulness (Recharge 6). The amnizu targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. That creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 26 (4d12) psychic damage and become stunned for 1 minute. A stunned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is stunned for the full minute, it forgets everything it sensed, experienced, and learned during the last 5 hours.

Spellcasting. The amnizu casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 19):

At will: command

3/day: dominate monster

1/day: feeblemind

Reactions

Instinctive Charm. When a creature within 60 feet of the amnizu makes an attack roll against it, and another creature is within the attack’s range, the attacker must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including the amnizu or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. If the saving throw is successful, the attacker is immune to the amnizu’s Instinctive Charm for 24 hours.


Annis Hag
Annis hags lair in mountains or hills. These hunchbacked and hump-shouldered hags are the largest and most physically imposing of their kind, standing eight feet tall. They can easily tear a fully grown person apart, but they love hunting the young, preferring their flesh above all others.

Annis hags leave tokens of their cruelty at the edges of forests and other areas they claim to provoke fear and distrust in nearby villages and settlements. To an annis hag, nothing is sweeter than making a once-vibrant community paralyzed with terror, so folk never venture out at night, strangers are met with suspicion and anger, and parents warn their children: “Be good, or the annis will get you.”

When an annis feels especially cruel, the hag adopts the appearance of a kindly elder, approaches a child in a remote place, and gives them an iron token (described below), through which the child can magically confide in the hag. Over time, “Granny” or “Grampy” convinces the child that it’s okay to do bad deeds—starting with breaking things or wandering without permission, then graduating to pushing someone down the stairs or setting a house on fire. Eventually, the child’s terrified family and community face painful decisions of what to do about the seemingly remorseless child.

Much as annis hags befriend children in order to corrupt them, they may adopt a group of ogres, trolls, or other creatures (ogres and trolls appear in the Monster Manual), ruling them through brute strength, insults, and superstition.

Iron Token
An annis hag can pull out one of their iron teeth or nails and spend 1 minute shaping and polishing it into the form of a coin, a ring, or a tiny mirror. Thereafter, any creature that holds this iron token can have a whispered conversation with the hag, provided the creature and the hag are within 10 miles of each other. When the hag speaks through the token, the holder can hear the hag’s whisper but not any other sounds at the hag’s location. Similarly, the hag can hear the holder of the token but not the noise around it.

A hag can have up to three iron tokens active at one time. As an action, the hag can discern the direction and approximate distance to those active tokens. The hag can deactivate any of those tokens at any distance (no action required), whereupon the token retains its current form but loses its magic.

Archdruid
Archdruids watch over the natural wonders of their domains. They seldom interact with folk away from their druid groves and shrines, unless there is a great threat to the natural order or to a nearby community. An archdruid typically has one or more pupils who are druids (see the Monster Manual), and the archdruid’s lair is usually guarded by loyal Beasts and Fey creatures.

When an archdruid uses their Change Shape action, you may choose the creature they turn into, abiding by the action’s restrictions. Or you may roll on the Archdruid Favored Shapes table to determine the form the archdruid adopts. These creatures appear in the Monster Manual, unless otherwise noted.

The archdruid can revert to its true form using a bonus action.

While in a new form, the archdruid’s stat block is replaced by the stat block of that form, except the archdruid keeps its current hit points, its hit point maximum, this bonus action, its languages and ability to speak, and its Spellcasting action.

The new form’s attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks.


Archer

Archers defend castles, hunt wild game on the fringes of civilization, serve as artillery in military units, and occasionally make good coin as brigands or caravan guards.

Some renowned archers and groups of archers are known for the special fletching of their arrows. You may roll on the Archer Fletching table to determine the distinctive fletching used by an individual archer or a group of them.

Armanite
Great herds of armanites race across the blasted fields of the Abyss, bent on slaughter and death, driven by unrestrained bloodlust. Whether they’re controlled by more powerful demons or charging into battle for the sake of it, armanites use their claws and hooves, as well as their long, whiplike tails, to tear apart foes.

In the armies of demon lords, armanites perform the role of heavy cavalry, leading the charge and tearing into their enemies’ flanks. Armanites fight all the time—even battling each other if they can’t find another enemy. They make ideal shock troops, utterly ruthless and bold to the point of stupidity.

Part of what makes armanites so fearsome is the number of weapons they have at their disposal. They possess dense hooves, claws that end in curling talons, and long tails whose serrated ridges can flense the flesh from a victim, and they use them all to carve through their foes. When they’re up against tough formations, they can call on their innate magic to loose bolts of lightning and blow holes in enemy ranks.

Serrated Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage.

Lightning Lance (Recharge 5–6). The armanite looses a bolt of lightning in a line that is 60 feet long and 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


Astral Dreadnought
Enormous and terrifying, astral dreadnoughts haunt the silvery void of the Astral Plane, causing planar travelers to shudder at the very thought of them. Dreadnoughts have been gliding through the astral mists since the dawn of the multiverse, trying to devour all other creatures they encounter.

Covered from head to tail in layers of thick, spiked plates, a dreadnought has two gnarled limbs that end in magic-enhanced pincer claws. Constellations appear to swirl in the depths of its single eye, and its serpentine tail trails off into the silvery void. Anything it swallows is deposited in a unique demiplane—an enclosed space that contains eons worth of detritus, as well as the remains of travelers. The place has gravity and breathable air, and organic matter decays there. When the dreadnought dies, its demiplane vanishes, and its contents are released into the Astral Plane.

Antimagic Cone. The dreadnought’s eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, it decides which way the cone faces. The cone doesn’t function while the eye is closed or while the dreadnought is blinded.

Astral Entity. The dreadnought can’t leave the Astral Plane, nor can it be banished or otherwise transported out of that plane.

Demiplanar Donjon. Anything the dreadnought swallows is transported to a demiplane that can be entered by no other means except a wish spell or the dreadnought’s Bite and Donjon Visit. A creature can leave the demiplane only by using magic that enables planar travel, such as the plane shift spell. The demiplane resembles a stone cave roughly 1,000 feet in diameter with a ceiling 100 feet high. Like a stomach, it contains the remains of past meals. The dreadnought can’t be harmed from within the demiplane. If the dreadnought dies, the demiplane disappears, and everything inside it appears around the dreadnought’s corpse. The demiplane is otherwise indestructible.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the dreadnought fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Sever Silver Cord. If the dreadnought scores a critical hit against a creature traveling by means of the astral projection spell, the dreadnought can cut the target’s silver cord instead of dealing damage.

Unusual Nature. The dreadnought doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Actions

Multiattack. The dreadnought makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (5d10 + 9) force damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature and this damage reduces it to 0 hit points or it is incapacitated, the dreadnought swallows it. The swallowed target, along with everything it is wearing and carrying, appears in an unoccupied space on the floor of the Demiplanar Donjon.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d6 + 9) force damage.

Legendary Actions

The dreadnought can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dreadnought regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Claw. The dreadnought makes one Claw attack.

Donjon Visit (Costs 2 Actions). One Huge or smaller creature that the dreadnought can see within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space on the floor of the Demiplanar Donjon. At the end of the target’s next turn, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Psychic Projection (Costs 3 Actions). Each creature within 60 feet of the dreadnought must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw, taking 26 (4d10 + 4) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


Monsters: B
Babau
Demons and devils clash endlessly for control of the Lower Planes. One of these battles pitted the legions of the archdevil Glasya against the screaming hordes of the demon lord Graz’zt (appears in this book). It is said that when Glasya wounded Graz’zt with her sword, the first babaus arose where his blood struck the ground. Their sudden appearance helped rout Glasya and secured Graz’zt’s place as one of the preeminent demon lords of the Abyss.

A babau demon has the cunning of a devil and the bloodthirstiness of a demon. It has leathery skin pulled tight over its gaunt frame and a curved horn protruding from the back of its elongated skull. A babau’s baleful glare can weaken a creature, and its talons gleam with acidic slime.

I’m unimpressed by most children. They are a blend of their ancestors but often more disappointing. You’d think two of the most beautiful, bloodthirsty beings of the Lower Planes would create a creature of greater potential. Instead, the ghastly babau fails to match the fiendish splendor of its parents.

Weakening Gaze. The babau targets one creature that it can see within 20 feet of it. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


Bael

With the Blood War between devils and demons raging for eons and no end in sight, opportunities abound for ambitious archdevils to win fame, glory, and power in the ongoing struggle. Duke Bael, one of Mammon’s most important vassals, has won fame and acclaim for his victories. Charged with leading sixty-six companies of barbed devils (see the Monster Manual), Bael has proven to be a tactical genius, earning esteem for himself and his master as a result of victory after victory over the abyssal host. Mammon relies on Bael to safeguard his holdings because of Bael’s battle acumen. During a time when so many other archdevils have lost their positions, Mammon has never been ousted, which is a testament to Bael’s skill on the battlefield.

For his accomplishments, Bael has been granted the title of Bronze General. His accolades notwithstanding, he has had a difficult time navigating the quagmire of infernal politics. His critics call him naive, though never to his face. His primary interest has always been leading soldiers in battle, so he finds it frustrating to have his ambitions of ascending to a higher rank constantly stymied by politically shrewd rivals.

Bael prefers to make servants out of his adversaries, and mortals bound to his service earn their wretched place by falling victim to his superior stratagems. Bael gladly spares the lives of those he defeats—if they pledge their souls and service to him. Demons are an exception; although he is willing to corrupt almost any other foes, he always destroys demons he defeats.

Bael also welcomes mortals into his service if they can provide him with an advantage in his politicking. He recruits savvy individuals and relies on them to represent his interests at Mammon’s court, which leaves him free to pursue his battle lust.

Despite his lack of interest in affairs outside battle, or perhaps because of it, Bael has gained a small following of cultists. Those who worship at his altar call him the King of Hell, and the most deluded believe that he is the lord of all devils. In arcane circles, certain writings, such as the dreaded Book of Fire, say that Bael revealed the invisibility spell to the world, though some scholars of magic hotly refute such claims. Bael is sometimes depicted as a toad, a cat, a human, or some combination of these forms.

Balhannoth
Native to the Shadowfell, the vicious, predatory balhannoth alters reality in its lair to make the place appear inviting to travelers. A limited form of telepathy enables a balhannoth to identify images of places where its prey expects their needs and desires to be met, such as an inn or a temple offering healing. It then warps reality around itself, hiding itself and remaking its environment to resemble such a place. The imitation is imperfect, but it’s good enough to fool greedy or desperate creatures. Once its prey enters the trap, it snatches the targets and teleports away to feed on their fear and despair.

Dungeon builders and Underdark tyrants sometimes venture into the Shadowfell to capture balhannoths for use as guardians.

Actions

Multiattack. The balhannoth makes one Bite attack and two Tentacle attacks.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d10 + 3) piercing damage.

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15) and is moved up to 5 feet toward the balhannoth. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the balhannoth can’t use this tentacle against other targets. The balhannoth has four tentacles.

Legendary Actions

The balhannoth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The balhannoth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Bite. The balhannoth makes one Bite attack against one creature it has grappled.

Teleport. The balhannoth teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying and any creatures it has grappled, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

Vanish. The balhannoth magically becomes invisible for up to 10 minutes or until immediately after it makes an attack roll.


A Balhannoth’s Lair
In the Shadowfell, balhannoths make their lairs near places inhabited by creatures they hunt. They typically haunt well-traveled roads and paths, snatching people who come along. A balhannoth used as a guardian in the Underdark might lair in caves near Underdark passages and guard the ways in and out of its keepers’ enclave.

Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a balhannoth can take one of the following lair actions; the balhannoth can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

Teleport. The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, or the target, along with whatever it is wearing and carrying, teleports to an unoccupied space of the balhannoth’s choice within 60 feet of it.

Vanish. The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, or the balhannoth becomes invisible to that creature for 1 minute. This effect ends if the balhannoth attacks the target.

Warp Terrain. The balhannoth warps reality around it in an area up to 500 feet square. After 10 minutes, the terrain in the area reshapes to assume the appearance of a location sought by one Humanoid whose desires the balhannoth has sensed (see Regional Effects below). The transformation affects nonliving material only and can’t create anything with moving parts or magical properties. Any object created in this area is, upon close inspection, revealed as a fake. Books are filled with empty pages, golden items are obvious counterfeits, and so on. The transformation lasts until the balhannoth dies or takes this lair action again.

Regional Effects
A region containing a balhannoth’s lair becomes warped by the creature’s unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

Sense Desires. The balhannoth can sense the strongest desires of any Humanoid within 1 mile of it and learns whether those desires involve a place: a safe location to rest, such as a temple, a home, or somewhere else.

Supernatural Lure. Creatures within 1 mile of the balhannoth’s lair experience the sensation of being close to whatever they desire most. The sensation grows stronger the closer the creatures come to the balhannoth’s lair.

If the balhannoth dies, these effects end immediately.

Banderhobb
A banderhobb is a hybrid of shadow and flesh. Through vile magic, these components take on an enormous and horrific upright shape resembling a bipedal toad. In this form, a banderhobb temporarily serves its creator as a thug, a thief, and a kidnapper that swallows the unwary.

Hags have devised a ritual for creating banderhobbs—a hag who knows the ritual might be willing to teach it for the right price. Some other wicked Fey and powerful Fiends also know of the process, as do a few mortal mages.

During its brief existence, a banderhobb attempts to carry out its creator’s bidding. It accomplishes its mission with no concern for the harm it suffers or causes. Its only desire is to serve and succeed. A banderhobb that is assigned to track down a target is particularly dangerous when it is provided with a lock of hair, a personal belonging, or another object connected to the target. Possession of such an item allows it to sense the creature’s location from as far as a mile away.

A banderhobb fulfills its duties until its existence ends. When it expires, usually several days after its birth, it leaves behind only tarry goo and wisps of shadow. Legends tell of an ominous tower in the Shadowfell where the shadows sometimes reform and banderhobbs roam.

Resonant Connection. If the banderhobb has even a tiny piece of a creature or an object in its possession, such as a lock of hair or a splinter of wood, it knows the most direct route to that creature or object if it is within 1 mile of the banderhobb.

Actions

Multiattack. The banderhobb makes one Bite attack and one Tongue attack. It can replace one attack with a use of Shadow Step.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the banderhobb can’t use its Bite attack or Tongue attack on another target.

Tongue. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled to a space within 5 feet of the banderhobb.

Shadow Step. The banderhobb teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of dim light or darkness that it can see.

Swallow. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature grappled by the banderhobb. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) piercing damage. The creature is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the banderhobb, and it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the banderhobb’s turns. A creature reduced to 0 hit points in this way stops taking the necrotic damage and becomes stable.

The banderhobb can have only one creature swallowed at a time. While the banderhobb isn’t incapacitated, it can regurgitate the creature at any time (no action required) in a space within 5 feet of it. The creature exits prone. If the banderhobb dies, it likewise regurgitates a swallowed creature.

Bonus Actions

Shadow Stealth. While in dim light or darkness, the banderhobb takes the Hide action.


Baphomet
Civilization is weakness and brutality is strength in the credo of Baphomet, the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts. He is worshiped by those who want to break the confines of civility and unleash their bestial natures, for Baphomet envisions a world without restraint, where creatures live out their most bloodthirsty desires.

Cults devoted to Baphomet use mazes and complex knots as their emblems. They create secret places to indulge themselves, including labyrinths of the sort their master favors. Bloodstained crowns and weapons of iron and brass decorate their profane altars.

Over time, a cultist of Baphomet becomes tainted by his influence, gaining bloodshot eyes and coarse, thickening hair. Small horns eventually sprout from the cultist’s forehead. In time, a devoted cultist might transform entirely into a minotaur, which is considered the greatest gift of the Prince of Beasts.

Baphomet appears as a fearsome, 20-foot-tall minotaur with six iron horns. A fiendish light burns in his red eyes. Although he is filled with bestial blood lust, there lies within him a cruel and cunning intellect devoted to subverting all civilization.

Baphomet wields a great glaive called Heartcleaver. He also charges his enemies and gores them with his horns, trampling his foes into the earth and rending them with his teeth like a beast.

Labyrinthine Recall. Baphomet can perfectly recall any path he has traveled, and he is immune to the maze spell.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Baphomet fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Resistance. Baphomet has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Multiattack. Baphomet makes one Bite attack, one Gore attack, and one Heartcleaver attack. He also uses Frightful Presence.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d8 + 10) piercing damage.

Gore. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d6 + 10) piercing damage. If Baphomet moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 16 (3d10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.

Heartcleaver. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (2d10 + 10) force damage.

Frightful Presence. Each creature of Baphomet’s choice within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. These later saves have disadvantage if Baphomet is within line of sight of the creature.

If a creature succeeds on any of these saves or the effect ends on it, the creature is immune to Baphomet’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

Spellcasting. Baphomet casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):

3/day each: dispel magic, dominate beast, maze, wall of stone

1/day: teleport

Legendary Actions

Baphomet can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Baphomet regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

Heartcleaver Attack. Baphomet makes one Heartcleaver attack.

Charge (Costs 2 Actions). Baphomet moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks, then makes a Gore attack.


Baphomet’s Lair
Baphomet’s lair is his palace, the Lyktion, which is on the layer of the Abyss called the Endless Maze. Nestled within the twisting passages of the plane-wide labyrinth, the Lyktion is immaculately maintained and surrounded by a moat constructed in the fashion of a three-dimensional maze. The palace is a towering structure whose interior is as labyrinthine as the plane on which it stands; it is populated by minotaurs, goristros, and quasits, all of which appear in the Monster Manual.

Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Baphomet can take one of the following lair actions; he can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

Illusory Room. Baphomet casts mirage arcane, affecting a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. The effect ends on the next initiative count 20. Charisma is Baphomet’s spellcasting ability for this spell.

Reverse Gravity. Baphomet chooses a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. Until the next initiative count 20, gravity is reversed within that room. Any creatures or objects in the room when this happens fall in the direction of the new pull of gravity, unless they have some means of remaining aloft. Baphomet can ignore the gravity reversal if he’s in the room, although he likes to use this action to land on a ceiling to attack targets flying near it.

Seal the Way. Baphomet seals one doorway or other entryway within the lair. The opening must be unoccupied. It is filled with solid stone for 1 minute or until Baphomet takes this lair action again.

Regional Effects
The region containing Baphomet’s lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

Beguiling Realm. Within 6 miles of the lair, all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Performance) checks have disadvantage, and all Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks have advantage.

Hedge Mazes. Plant life within 1 mile of the lair grows thick and forms walls of trees, hedges, and other flora in the form of small mazes.

Panicked Beasts. Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become frightened and disoriented, as though constantly under threat of being hunted, and might lash out or panic even when no visible threat is nearby.

If Baphomet dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

Cultists of Baphomet
Baphomet grants his cultists special abilities. All his devotees gain the Labyrinthine Recall trait below. He grants his rank-and-file followers the Unerring Tracker trait, and cult leaders gain the Incite the Hunters trait.

Labyrinthine Recall. This creature can perfectly recall any path it has traveled.

Unerring Tracker. As a bonus action, this creature magically creates a psychic link with one creature it can see. For the next hour, as a bonus action this creature learns the current distance and direction to the target if it is on the same plane of existence. The link ends if this creature is incapacitated or if it uses this ability on a different target.

Incite the Hunters (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). As an action, this creature allows each ally within 30 feet of it that has the Unerring Tracker trait to make one weapon attack as a reaction against the target of that ally’s Unerring Tracker.

Bard
Bards are gifted poets, storytellers, and entertainers who travel far and wide. They’re commonly found in taverns or in the company of jolly bands of adventurers, rough-and-tumble mercenaries, and wealthy patrons.

Multiattack. The bard makes two Shortsword or Shortbow attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

Shortsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

Shortbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

Cacophony (Recharge 4–6). Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from the bard must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the bard. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.

Spellcasting. The bard casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

At will: dancing lights, mage hand, prestidigitation

1/day each: charm person, invisibility, sleep

Bonus Actions

Taunt (2/Day). The bard targets one creature within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the bard, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of the bard’s next turn.

Barghest
Long ago, the god Maglubiyet—conqueror and then lord of early goblinoids—bargained with the General of Gehenna for aid. The General provided yugoloths, which then died in service to Maglubiyet. Yet when the time came to honor his part of the compact, Maglubiyet reneged on the deal. In vengeance, the General of Gehenna created the soul-devouring barghests to devour goblinoid souls.

The mission of every barghest, implanted in it by the General of Gehenna, is to consume souls. It eats these souls by devouring the bodies of those it kills, preferring goblinoids.


A barghest hungers for the day when it can complete its mission, return to Gehenna, and serve the General directly in his yugoloth legions, but it doesn’t kill goblinoids indiscriminately. By devouring the souls of goblinoid leaders and other powerful individuals, a barghest earns elevated status in the afterlife. Barghests typically keep their true nature secret, preying on the occasional lone goblin when the opportunity arises, until they reach adulthood and are capable of seeking out stronger prey.

A barghest avoids contact with large, open fires. Any conflagration larger than its body acts as a gateway to Gehenna and banishes it to that plane, where it is likely to be slain or enslaved by a yugoloth for its failure.

Fire Banishment. When the barghest starts its turn engulfed in flames that are at least 10 feet high or wide, it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be instantly banished to Gehenna.

Soul Feeding. The barghest can feed on the corpse of a Fey or Humanoid it killed within the past 10 minutes. This feeding takes at least 1 minute, and it destroys the corpse. The victim’s soul is trapped in the barghest for 24 hours, after which time it is digested and the person is incapable of being revived. If the barghest dies before the soul is digested, the soul is released. While a soul is trapped in the barghest, any magic that tries to restore the soul to life has a 50 percent chance of failing and being wasted.

Actions

Multiattack. The barghest makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.

Spellcasting. The barghest casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

At will: levitate, minor illusion, pass without trace

1/day each: charm person, dimension door, suggestion

Bonus Actions

Change Shape. The barghest transforms into a Small goblin or back into its true form. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. The barghest reverts to its true form if it dies.

Berbalang
Berbalangs creep across the petrified remains of dead gods adrift on the Astral Plane. Obsessed with gathering secrets, both from the gods they inhabit and from the bones of dead creatures, they call forth the spirits of the dead and force them to divulge what they learned in life.

Berbalangs prefer to speak only to dead things, and specifically only to the spirits they call forth in the hope of learning secrets. They record their stories on the bones that once belonged to these creatures, thus preserving the information they gain.

Pursuit of knowledge drives everything berbalangs do. Although they mostly learn their secrets from the dead, they aren’t above spying on the living to take knowledge from them as well. A berbalang can create a spectral duplicate of itself and send the duplicate out to gather information on other planes by watching places where the gods and their servants gather. When a berbalang is perceiving its environment through its duplicate, its actual body is unconscious and can’t protect itself. Thus, a berbalang typically uses its duplicate for only a short time before returning its consciousness to its body.

The knowledge that berbalangs accumulate makes them great sources of information for powerful people traveling the planes. Berbalangs ignore petitioners, however, unless they come bearing a choice secret or the bones of a particularly interesting creature. Some githyanki have been able to strike deals with the creatures, using berbalangs to spy on their enemies and to watch over their crèches on the Material Plane.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.

Spellcasting. The berbalang casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability:

At will: speak with dead

1/day: plane shift (self only)

Bonus Actions

Spectral Duplicate (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The berbalang creates one spectral duplicate of itself in an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of it. While the duplicate exists, the berbalang is unconscious. A berbalang can have only one duplicate at a time. The duplicate disappears when it or the berbalang drops to 0 hit points or when the berbalang dismisses it (no action required).

The duplicate has the same statistics and knowledge as the berbalang, and everything experienced by the duplicate is known by the berbalang. All damage dealt by the duplicate’s attacks is psychic damage.


Bheur Hag
Bheur hags live in wintry lands, favoring snowy mountains. These hags become more active during winter, using their ice and weather magic to make life miserable for nearby settlements.

A bheur hag’s skin has the bluish hue of a person who has frozen to death. The hag’s hair is white, and the hag is emaciated, with pale eyes surrounded by bruise-colored flesh. A bheur hag carries a twisted gray wooden staff that can be ridden like a flying broom and that augments the hag’s magic.

Bheur hags are attracted to selfish actions inspired by deadly cold, such as murdering a traveler for a winter coat or chopping down a dryad’s grove for firewood. These actions are especially sweet to a bheur if they are unwarranted, such as a greedy merchant hoarding excess food for the winter while others starve. Bheurs use their ability to manipulate weather to batter villages with freezing cold, hoping to instill a despair that turns folk against each other.

In combat, a bheur hag also strives to inspire horror. When near a recently slain foe, the hag may forgo an attack to feed on the corpse. The sight of this butchery is enough to terrify most witnesses.

Control Weather (1/Day). The hag can cast the control weather spell, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability.

Graystaff Magic. The hag carries a graystaff, a magic staff. The hag can use its flying speed only while astride the staff. If the staff is lost or destroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a day. Only a bheur hag can use a graystaff.

Ice Walk. The hag can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost the hag extra moment.

Actions

Multiattack. The hag makes two Slam or Frost Shard attacks.

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d8 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) cold damage.

Frost Shard. Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (6d8 + 3) cold damage, and the target’s speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of the hag’s next turn.

Horrific Feast. The hag feeds on the corpse of one enemy within reach that died within the past minute. Each creature of the hag’s choice that is within 60 feet and able to see the feeding must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the hag for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature is incapacitated, can’t understand what others say, can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag’s Horrific Feast for the next 24 hours.

Spellcasting. While holding or riding the graystaff, the hag casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):

At will: hold person

1/day each: cone of cold, ice storm, wall of ice


Blackguard
Blackguards are paladins who broke their sacred oaths and now indulge their own villainous ambitions. They consort with Fiends and Undead, and they reject many of the goodly things from their former lives.

Glaive. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.

Shortbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

Dreadful Aspect (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). Each enemy within 30 feet of the blackguard must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the blackguard for 1 minute. If a frightened target ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the blackguard, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Spellcasting. The blackguard casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

2/day each: command, dispel magic, find steed

Bonus Actions

Smite. Immediately after the blackguard hits a target with an attack roll, the blackguard can force that target to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers one of the following effects of the blackguard’s choice:

Blind. The target is blinded for 1 minute. The blinded target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Shove. The target is pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.

Bodak
A bodak is the undying remains of someone who revered Orcus (appears in this book). Devoid of life and soul, it exists only to cause death.

A worshiper of Orcus can take ritual vows while carving the demon lord’s symbol on their chest over the heart. Orcus’s power flays body, mind, and soul, leaving behind a sentient husk that consumes life energy near it. Most bodaks come into being in this way, then are unleashed to spread death in Orcus’s name.

Bodaks are extensions of Orcus’s will outside the Abyss, serving the demon prince’s aims and other minions. Orcus can recall anything a bodak sees or hears. If he so chooses, he can speak through a bodak to address his enemies and followers directly.

A bodak retains vague impressions of its past life. It seeks out its former allies and enemies alike to destroy them, as its warped soul seeks to erase anything connected to its former life. Minions of Orcus are the one exception to this compulsion; a bodak recognizes them as kindred souls and spares them from its wrath. Anyone who knew the individual before its transformation into a bodak can recognize mannerisms or other subtle clues to its original identity.

Death Gaze. When a creature that can see the bodak’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the bodak, the bodak can force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if the bodak isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points unless it is immune to the frightened condition. Otherwise, a creature takes 16 (3d10) psychic damage on a failed save.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against the bodak until the start of its next turn. If the creature looks at the bodak in the meantime, that creature must immediately make the saving throw.

Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The bodak takes 5 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

Unusual Nature. The bodak doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Actions

Fist. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.

Withering Gaze. One creature that the bodak can see within 60 feet of it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Bonus Actions

Aura of Annihilation. The bodak activates or deactivates this deathly aura. While active, the aura deals 5 necrotic damage to any creature that ends its turn within 30 feet of the bodak. Undead and Fiends ignore this effect.


Boggle
Boggles are the little bogeys of fairy tales. They lurk in the fringes of the Feywild and are also found on the Material Plane, where they hide under beds and in closets, waiting to frighten and bedevil folk with their mischief.

Boggles are born out of feelings of loneliness. They materialize when a sapient being feels isolated or abandoned near a place where the Feywild touches the world. For example, a forsaken child might unintentionally conjure a boggle and see them as a sort of imaginary friend. A boggle might also appear in the attic of a lonely widower’s house or in a hermit’s cave.

Boggles engage in petty pranks to amuse themselves, using the oil they excrete to cause trouble. A boggle also isn’t above breaking dishes, hiding tools, startling cows to decrease their milk, or hiding a baby in an attic. Although a boggle’s antics might cause distress and unintentional harm, mischief—not mayhem—is usually the intent. If threatened, a boggle flees rather than stand and fight.

A boggle can create magical openings to travel short distances or to pilfer items that would otherwise be beyond its reach. To create such a rift in space, a boggle must be adjacent to a space defined by a frame, such as an open window or a doorway, a gap between the bars of a cage, or the opening between the feet of a bed and the floor. The rift is invisible and disappears after a few seconds—just enough time for the boggle to step, reach, or attack through it.

Oil Puddle. The boggle creates a puddle of nonflammable oil. The puddle is 1 inch deep and covers the ground in the boggle’s space. The puddle is difficult terrain for all creatures except boggles and lasts for 1 hour. The oil has one of the following additional effects of the boggle’s choice:

Slippery Oil. Any non-boggle creature that enters the puddle or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

Sticky Oil. Any non-boggle creature that enters the puddle or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be restrained. On its turn, a creature can use an action to try to extricate itself, ending the effect and moving into the nearest unoccupied space of its choice with a successful DC 11 Strength check.

Bonus Actions

Boggle Oil. The boggle excretes nonflammable oil from its pores, giving itself one of the following benefits of its choice until it uses this bonus action again:

Slippery Oil. The boggle has advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to escape bonds and end grapples, and it can move through openings large enough for a Tiny creature without squeezing.

Sticky Oil. The boggle has advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to grapple and any ability check made to maintain a hold on another creature, a surface, or an object. The boggle can also climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

Dimensional Rift. The boggle creates an invisible and immobile rift within an opening or frame it can see within 5 feet of it, provided that the space is no bigger than 10 feet on any side. The dimensional rift bridges the distance between that space and a point within 30 feet of it that the boggle can see or specify by distance and direction (such as “30 feet straight up”). While next to the rift, the boggle can see through it and is considered to be next to the destination as well, and anything the boggle puts through the rift (including a portion of its body) emerges at the destination. Only the boggle can use the rift, and it lasts until the end of the boggle’s next turn.


Boneclaw
A wizard who tries to become a lich but fails might become a boneclaw instead. These hideous, cackling monsters share a few of liches’ attributes, but while liches are immortal masters of the arcane, boneclaws are thralls to evil, hatred, and pain.

The most important part of the transformation ritual occurs when the soul of the aspiring lich migrates to a prepared phylactery. If the wizard is too physically or magically weak to compel the soul into its new home, the soul instead seeks out a master—a person within a few miles who has a hate-filled heart. The soul bonds to that person and becomes enslaved to its new master’s wishes. The boneclaw forms near its master, sometimes appearing before that individual to receive orders and other times simply seeking to fulfill its master’s desires.

A boneclaw can serve only an evil creature. If its master finds redemption or sincerely turns away from the path of evil, the boneclaw is destroyed. Otherwise, a boneclaw can’t be destroyed while its master lives. No matter what happens to the boneclaw’s body, it re-forms within hours.

In service to its master, a boneclaw delights in causing horrific pain. It lurks like a spider in shadowy recesses, waiting for victims to approach within reach of its long, bony limbs. Once speared, a creature is pulled into the darkness to be sliced apart.

Rejuvenation. While its master lives, a destroyed boneclaw gains a new body in 1d10 hours, with all its hit points. The new body appears within 1 mile of the boneclaw’s master.

Unusual Nature. The boneclaw doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Actions

Multiattack. The boneclaw makes two Piercing Claw attacks.

Piercing Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, the boneclaw can pull the target up to 10 feet toward itself, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). The boneclaw has two claws. While a claw grapples a target, the claw can attack only that target.

Shadow Jump (Recharge 5–6). If the boneclaw is in dim light or darkness, each creature of the boneclaw’s choice within 15 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 34 (5d12 + 2) necrotic damage.

The boneclaw then teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. It can bring one creature it’s grappling, teleporting that creature to an unoccupied space it can see within 5 feet of its destination. The destination spaces of this teleportation must be in dim light or darkness.

Bonus Actions

Shadow Stealth. While in dim light or darkness, the boneclaw takes the Hide action.

Reactions

Deadly Reach. In response to a creature entering a space within 15 feet of it, the boneclaw makes one Piercing Claw attack against that creature.


Bulezau
Diseased manifestations of animalistic rage, bulezaus embody the violence of nature. Across the Abyss, these demons lurk in deep canyons and lofty crags, and many find a place in the ranks of demon lords’ armies, serving as foot soldiers in the Abyss’s endless warring.

Bulezaus crave violence. Their eagerness to kill and willingness to die make them common members of many demon lords’ entourages. When not being corralled by larger and tougher demons, bulezaus gather into scrabbling mobs, wrestling and fighting among themselves until a better target comes along or until a stronger demon bullies them into subservience.

Disfiguring ailments plague bulezaus: crusted eyes, maggots wriggling in open sores, and a reek of rotten meat that follows them wherever they go.

Some ask why the bulezau, for all its rage and violence, has the head of a goat. I always respond, have you met a goat? They’re stubborn, they’re vicious, and they rarely go down without bashing you several times in the shins.

You might say, that’s awfully specific. I say, don’t pry.

Rotting Presence. When any creature that isn’t a demon starts its turn within 30 feet of the bulezau, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.

Standing Leap. The bulezau’s long jump is up to 20 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.

Sure-Footed. The bulezau has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.

Actions

Barbed Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d12 + 2) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease ends. While poisoned in this way, the target sports festering boils, coughs up flies, and sheds rotting skin, and the target must repeat the saving throw after every 24 hours that elapse. On a successful save, the disease ends. On a failed save, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by 4 (1d8) until the disease ends on the target. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.


Monsters: C
Cadaver Collector
The ancient war machines known as cadaver collectors lumber aimlessly across the blasted plains of Acheron until they are called upon by a necromancer to bolster the ranks of a conquering army on the Material Plane. These fearsome Constructs obey their summoners until they are dismissed back to Acheron, but if a summoner comes to a bad end, a cadaver collector might wander the Material Plane for centuries, collecting corpses while searching for a way to return home.

Cadaver collectors respond to a summons from a mortal only when they are called to the scene of a great battle—either where one is in progress, where one is imminent, or where one once took place. They encase themselves in the armor and weapons of fallen warriors and impale the corpses of those warriors on the lances and other weapons embedded in their salvaged armor.

Corpses that accumulate on a cadaver collector’s shell aren’t just grisly battle trophies. A cadaver collector can summon the spirits of these cadavers to battle against its enemies. Although these specters are individually weak, a cadaver collector can call up an almost endless supply of them, if given enough time.

Magic Resistance. The collector has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Multiattack. The collector makes two Slam attacks.

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 16 (3d10) necrotic damage.

Paralyzing Breath (Recharge 5–6). The collector releases paralyzing gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

Bonus Actions

Summon Specters (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The collector calls up the enslaved spirits of those it has slain; 1d4 specters (without Sunlight Sensitivity; see the Monster Manual) arise in unoccupied spaces within 15 feet of it. The specters act right after the collector on the same initiative count and fight until they’re destroyed. They disappear when the collector is destroyed.


Canoloth
A type of yugoloth, canoloths are fiendish trackers and guardians employed by evil powers. They prefer to enter into contracts to guard valuable treasures and important locations. They always do exactly as asked—never any more, never any less.

With senses sharp enough to pinpoint the locations of nearby invisible creatures, canoloths respond unfailingly to any threat to their charges. Furthermore, they emit a magical distortion field that prevents creatures close to them from teleporting.

Canoloths confront intruders with swift and terrible force, projecting long, spiny tongues to grab their foes and drag them close. What happens next depends on the contract. Unless instructed to kill, a canoloth merely holds on to its prisoner, but if given the order to do so, it tears its prey limb from limb.

Canoloths are glorified guard dogs. If you must engage one, just find out exactly what it’s been assigned to do. I’ve often found I can waltz right past them by taking advantage of a relevant loophole.

Magic Resistance. The canoloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Uncanny Senses. The canoloth can’t be surprised unless it’s incapacitated.

Actions

Multiattack. The canoloth makes one Bite or Tongue attack and one Claw attack.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) force damage.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) force damage.

If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 15), pulled up to 30 feet toward the canoloth, and restrained until the grapple ends. The canoloth can grapple one target at a time with its tongue.


Catoblepas
The catoblepas is as loathsome as the vile swamplands in which it lives, a conglomeration of bloated buffalo, dinosaur, warthog, and hippopotamus parts. Despite its ungainly physiology, a catoblepas resembles a natural animal in its behavior, ambling through its marshy home, munching choice vegetation, eating the occasional bit of carrion, and wallowing in mire. A catoblepas might be found with the one mate it chooses for life and, on occasion, with a calf. A catoblepas attacks anyone that moves too close, especially if guarding its young.

A catoblepas’s stink, like the stench of death mixed with swamp gas and skunk musk, gives it away as being much more ghastly than its appearance suggests. When it is on the attack, a catoblepas reveals the extent of its horrific nature. The creature’s serpentine neck has trouble lifting its head, but one glare from its bloodshot eyes can rot flesh. At the end of its tail is a club that can rattle body and soul if it strikes true, leaving a victim unable to act while the catoblepas feasts on its body.

Blighted Territory
A catoblepas’s nature as a creature of disease and decay brings out similar characteristics in the creature’s swampy habitat. Such a wetland becomes gloomy, tangled, and more fetid than it was before. Beneficial qualities of the environment, such as healing herbs and clean water, become degraded, and swamp gases take on a hint of the catoblepas’s foulness. Animals in the area are more aggressive and liable to be diseased. Degenerate creatures are likely to take up residence near a catoblepas’s territory, as are those seeking to avoid notice.

Catoblepases in Folklore
Ordinary folk rarely see a catoblepas, but the creature has such a feared reputation that stories about it are ingrained in the popular culture. Any rumor of a catoblepas taking up residence nearby is taken to be a bad omen, even if the rumor is proven false. In some lands, the silhouette of a catoblepas, with its tail extended over its body and its head held low, is a baleful heraldic figure signifying death or doom.

Sages say that gods of pestilence and rot created catoblepases as embodiments of their influence, while other stories link them to misfortune. Some such tales claim that swamp-dwelling hags tend catoblepases like cattle, drinking the monsters’ milk and using them as guardians or pets. Other legends say that those of impure heart can tame a catoblepas and whisper of malevolent warlocks and wicked knights who ride them into battle.

Stench. Any creature other than a catoblepas that starts its turn within 10 feet of the catoblepas must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature’s next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Stench of any catoblepas for 1 hour.

Actions

Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (5d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of the catoblepas’s next turn.

Death Ray (Recharge 5–6). The catoblepas targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target instead takes 64 necrotic damage. The target dies if reduced to 0 hit points by this ray.


Cattle
Many kinds of cattle roam the multiverse, some of them domesticated and others feral. In many cultures, cattle are almost like family to the folk who tend to them.

Aurochs
An aurochs is a large, fierce bovine with jutting horns. In many lands, herds of aurochs roam free, while elsewhere orcs and humans train them from an early age to carry riders into combat.

Deep Rothé
Deep rothé are Underdark cattle that communicate with one another using the dancing lights spell. Some scholars speculate that rothé came originally from the Feywild and brought the ability to cast the spell with them. Other sages attribute the ability to the centuries rothé have spent in the Underdark, where ambient magic slowly transforms everything.

Stench Kow
Stench kows are misshapen bison native to the Lower Planes. These orange and green creatures defend themselves by exuding a miasma so hideous as to be toxic.

Cave Fisher
A cave fisher is a subterranean arachnid with a long snout that houses spinnerets, enabling the creature to produce sticky filaments, much like the strands of a spider’s webbing, which the creature uses to snag prey.

A cave fisher usually hunts small animals and is particularly fond of bats, so it stretches a filament over an opening that such prey might travel through. It then climbs to a hiding spot and adheres itself to the surface to rest and wait. When prey blunders into the filament, the cave fisher reels in its meal. A group of cave fishers might work together to cover a large area with filaments, but as soon as one captures potential food, every cave fisher in the area competes for the prize. If a victim escapes from the initial ambush, a cave fisher can reclaim its prey by shooting a filament out to capture it again.

Scarce food might draw a group of cave fishers up to the surface, into a shadowy canyon or a gloomy forest that features both native animal prey and creatures such as explorers or travelers occasionally moving through the area.

Valuable Parts
Nearly every part of a cave fisher is useful after the creature has been dispatched. Cave fisher filaments can be woven into rope that is thin, tough, and nearly invisible. The creature’s shell is used in the manufacture of tools, armor, and jewelry. Its blood is alcoholic and tastes like strong liquor. Several dwarven spirits include cave fisher blood, and some dwarves, especially berserkers, drink the blood straight. Cave fisher meat is edible, tasting much like crab cooked in strong wine.

While some folk hunt cave fishers to kill them to harvest their filaments, shells, and blood, others capture cave fisher eggs and rear the hatchlings, which can be trained to guard passages or serve as beasts of war. Cave fishers have a natural aversion to fire, since their blood is flammable. As such, Underdark denizens often use the threat of fire when training them.

Spider Climb. The cave fisher can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

Actions

Multiattack. The cave fisher makes two Claw attacks.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

Retract Filament. One Large or smaller creature grappled by the cave fisher’s Adhesive Filament must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cave fisher, and the cave fisher makes one Claw attack against it. Anyone else who was attached to the filament is released. Until the grapple ends on the target, the cave fisher can’t use Adhesive Filament.

Bonus Actions

Adhesive Filament. The cave fisher extends a sticky filament up to 60 feet, and the filament adheres to anything that touches it. A creature the filament adheres to is grappled by the cave fisher (escape DC 13), and ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). A weapon that fails to sever it becomes stuck to it, requiring an action and a successful DC 13 Strength check to pull free. Destroying the filament deals no damage to the cave fisher. The filament crumbles away if the cave fisher takes this bonus action again.


Champion
Bountiful and overrated. You can’t spit in this realm without hitting one. I have witnessed the birth, death, and unlife of more champions than I dare recount. Few are worth remembering.

—Mordenkainen

Champions are mighty warriors who have honed their fighting skills in wars or gladiatorial pits. To soldiers and other people who fight for a living, champions are as influential as nobles, and their presence is courted as a sign of status among rulers.

A typical champion bears a coat of arms, heraldry that is associated with the champion far and wide. You may create a coat of arms for a champion or roll on the Champion’s Coats of Arms table to determine it.

Champion’s Coats of Arms
d12	Coat of Arms

3	Hunting horn banded in gold on a gray field

Chitine
Dedicated to Lolth, chitines are multiarmed bipeds with arachnid qualities. Most live in colonies in the Underdark and fight the enemies of the Demon Queen of Spiders. Long ago, the cult of Lolth first subjected elf prisoners to horrible rituals that transformed them into creatures with both elven and spider traits, which their creators dubbed chitines. The intention was to create servile warriors dedicated first to the cult and then, only by association with it, to Lolth. The goddess found this arrangement unacceptable.

As punishment, the Spider Queen twisted her worshipers’ rituals. The process usually transformed subjects into the spindly creatures her devotees expected, but occasionally, an elf changed into a choldrith (appears in this book): an arachnid Monstrosity able to command and create more chitines on its own. These choldriths soon led the chitines to rebel and abandon their creators, founding free colonies elsewhere in the Underdark. On occasion, though, colonies can be found in remote, gloomy areas of the surface world, warring against Lolth’s enemies.

The cult of Lolth still creates chitines as the need arises. Outside the presence of a choldrith, chitines make good workers, and they can be useful if the cult finds an independent chitine colony and want to infiltrate it. If the creation process yields a choldrith, though, the cult destroys the creature.

As servants of Lolth, chitines love spiders. They rear spiders and similar arachnids, such as cave fishers (also in this book). Chitine colonies erect shrines to Lolth that serve as beacons, attracting spiders and other beings that serve her. Anywhere chitines set up a colony quickly becomes a web-shrouded, gloomy, and treacherous place.

Chitines resemble spiders, but they behave more like social insects such as ants. They are divided into worker and warrior castes; choldriths, when present, occupy the top levels of a colony’s hierarchy. Each chitine has a social position that comes with duties related to that rank, and all are expected to sacrifice themselves to protect the colony’s choldriths. Every chitine has spinnerets and slowly produces webbing that is used to build floors, walls, structures, objects, and traps that benefit the colony. A warrior might be responsible for crafting web armor (which is as tough as hide or leather), while a group of workers might be tasked to dig pit traps and cover them with fragile webbing disguised with loose dirt to appear as a solid surface.

Dagger. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.


Choker
The choker is a subterranean predator far more dangerous than its small size and spindly, rubbery limbs would suggest.

Chokers have cartilage rather than a bony skeleton. This flexible internal structure enables them to easily slip into narrow fissures and niches in the walls of their cavern homes. They lurk in these spots, silent and unseen, waiting for prey to happen by.

A choker’s usual method for luring prey involves positioning the body of its latest catch just outside its hiding spot. Whenever it gets hungry, it tears off a few chunks of flesh to feed itself. In the meantime, the corpse serves to entice other curious folk—explorers from the surface world, drow, duergar, or the choker’s favorite prey, goblins—to come within reach.

When a target presents itself, the choker’s starfish-shaped hands dart out of its hiding spot, wrap around the victim’s throat, and pin the unfortunate creature against the cavern wall. Because its arms are so long, the choker can keep its body deep inside the crevice where it hides, beyond the reach of most normal weapons.

Chokers tend to set their ambushes alone, rather than working in concert, but where one choker is found, others are likely to be nearby. They communicate through eerie, keening howls that travel long distances through caves and tunnels but are difficult to identify or locate in a typical echo-filled cavern.

Actions

Multiattack. The choker makes two Tentacle attacks.

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the choker can’t use this tentacle on another target. The choker has two tentacles. If this attack is a critical hit, the target also can’t breathe or speak until the grapple ends.


Choldrith
Choldriths are monstrous spiderlike creatures originally created to serve Lolth. They rule colonies of chitines (in this book) and lead them into battle in Lolth’s war against her enemies.

When devotees of Lolth created the first chitines, she watched as her followers used arcane magic and demonic powers and invoked her aid for the divine spark needed to ensure the subjects’ survival, expecting to see these new abominations dedicated solely to her, but the devotees performed no such ritual. As revenge for the devotees’ betrayal, the Spider Queen manipulated the creation rituals so that they sometimes created choldriths instead of chitines.

At first, these devotees were unaware that the new creatures, which they dubbed choldriths, were signs of Lolth’s wrath. Instead, they were pleased, because choldriths could lay eggs that birthed more chitines (and the rare choldrith) and could direct the chitines in their work. But the devotees soon realized their mistake—choldriths belonged to Lolth, body and soul. Choldriths whispered to the chitines of their adoration of the Spider Queen and their enmity against their creators, and led them in a successful revolt.

Choldriths are born with a mystical connection to Lolth, which gives them divine magic. They also make up the ruling caste of most chitine colonies. A colony can support numerous choldriths, who serve as commanders, priests, and supervisors. The choldriths continually jockey for position, although they rarely confront one another in a way that puts the colony at risk. The colony is ruled by a sovereign, who determines which colony members perform which tasks, including whether a choldrith is permitted to lay eggs. Sometimes a choldrith ruler receives a vision from Lolth that inspires the entire colony into some grand, often violent, action.

Web (Recharge 5–6). Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one Large or smaller creature. Hit: The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 11 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; 5 hit points; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

Bonus Actions

Spectral Dagger (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The choldrith conjures a floating, spectral dagger within 60 feet of itself. The choldrith can make a melee spell attack (+4 to hit) against one creature within 5 feet of the dagger. On a hit, the target takes 6 (1d8 + 2) force damage.

The dagger lasts for 1 minute. As a bonus action on later turns, the choldrith can move the dagger up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against one creature within 5 feet of the dagger.


Clockworks
Gnomes’ tinkering with magic and mechanical devices has produced many failed Constructs but also has resulted in genuine advances, such as clockworks. The methods used to craft clockworks have been shared between gnome communities over many generations.

Bronze Scout
A bronze scout seldom emerges from underground. Its telescoping eyestalks observe foes at close range while most of its segmented body remains buried. If detected, it sends electrical shocks through the ground toward pursuers while it retreats.

Lightning Flare (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). Each creature in contact with the ground within 15 feet of the clockwork must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


Iron Cobra
An iron cobra is exactly what its name implies: a metal snake with a poisonous bite. Gnomes load this clockwork with alchemical concoctions that can paralyze creatures and cloud the mind.

Actions

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer one random effect (roll a d6):

1–2: Confusion. On its next turn, the target must use its action to make one weapon attack against a random creature it can see within 30 feet of it, using whatever weapon it has in hand and moving beforehand if necessary to get in range. If it’s holding no weapon, it makes an unarmed strike. If no creature is visible within 30 feet, it takes the Dash action, moving toward the nearest creature.

3–4: Paralysis. The target is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.

5–6: Poison. The target takes 13 (3d8) poison damage.


Oaken Bolter
No ordinary ballista, an oaken bolter is a Construct capable of striking at long distances. The bolts it launches can rend flesh, destroy armor, or drag enemies toward traps or melee-oriented clockworks—and at shorter ranges, burst with explosive force.

Unusual Nature. The clockwork doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Actions

Multiattack. The clockwork makes two Lancing Bolt attacks or one Lancing Bolt attack and one Harpoon attack.

Lancing Bolt. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

Harpoon. Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 50/200 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). While grappled in this way, a creature’s speed isn’t reduced, but it can move only in directions that bring it closer to the clockwork. A creature takes 5 (1d10) slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or if it tries and fails. The clockwork can grapple only one creature at a time with its harpoon.

Explosive Bolt (Recharge 5–6). The clockwork launches an explosive charge at a point within 120 feet. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Bonus Actions

Reel In. The clockwork pulls the creature grappled by its Harpoon up to 20 feet closer.

Unusual Nature. The clockwork doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Actions

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, it is knocked prone.

Reactions

Intercept Attack. In response to another creature within 5 feet of it being hit by an attack roll, the clockwork gives that creature a +5 bonus to its AC against that attack, potentially causing a miss. To use this ability, the clockwork must be able to see the creature and the attacker.


Individual Designs
Gnome artisans prefer unique clockworks over perfectly functioning ones that copy too much from other creations. A clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork’s builder.

Clockwork Enhancements
d10	Enhancement
1	Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it lacks that proficiency. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.
2	Sensors. The range of the clockwork’s darkvision increases by 60 feet, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it lacks that proficiency.
3	Fortified. The clockwork’s AC increases by 2.
4	Increased Speed. The clockwork’s speed increases by 10 feet.
5	Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.
6	Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with fewer than half its hit points but at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn’t function at the start of its next turn.
7	Sturdy Frame. The clockwork’s hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.
8	Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.
9	Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish.
10	Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.
Clockwork Malfunctions
d8	Malfunction
1	Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork’s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.
2	Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork’s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.
3	Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.
4	Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork’s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won’t willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks or damages it.
5	Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn’t use any of its speeds on its turn.
6	Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat if possible. It otherwise keeps fighting.
7	Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork’s turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.
8	Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.
I’ve sometimes made the mistake of disavowing gnomish contraptions altogether. Yet some are downright functional. That said, I still won’t entrust my well-being to a whirling kettle.

Cloud Giant Smiling One
Smiling ones are cloud giants who honor and emulate the craftiness and deceit of the deity Memnor above all else. They are tricksters supreme who use sleight of hand, deception, misdirection, and magic in their pursuit of wealth. They also possess a flair for unpredictability and a wicked sense of humor. Smiling ones overstep all bounds of decorum with their behavior, doing and saying things that even other knavish folk consider beneath their dignity.

Smiling ones take their name from the strange two-faced masks they wear. The smiling half of the face often looks more like a smirk or a triumphant sneer than a pleasant grin. The frowning half represents the displeasure smiling ones feel about cloud giants’ place in the ordning—second to storm giants. The masks serve as symbols of smiling ones’ devotion and also conceal their wearers’ true facial expressions.

Change Shape. The giant magically transforms to look and feel like a Beast or a Humanoid it has seen or to return to its true form. Any equipment the giant is wearing or carrying is absorbed by the new form. Its statistics, other than its size, don’t change. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

Spellcasting. The giant casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

At will: detect magic, fog cloud, light, minor illusion

1/day each: gaseous form, major image

Bonus Actions

Cloud Step (Recharge 4–6). The giant teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.


Corpse Flower
A corpse flower can sprout atop the grave of an evil necromancer or the remains of powerful Undead creatures. Unless it is uprooted and burned while it is still a seedling, the corpse flower grows to enormous size over several weeks, then tears itself free of the earth and begins scavenging Humanoid corpses from battlefields and graveyards. Using its fibrous tentacles, it stuffs the remains into its body to sustain and repair itself. The plant has a malevolent bent and despises the living.

With or without corpses nested in its body, a corpse flower exudes a stench of decay that can overwhelm the senses of nearby creatures, causing them to become nauseated. The stench, which serves as a defense mechanism, fades 2d4 days after the corpse flower dies.

Corpses. When first encountered, a corpse flower contains the corpses of 1d6 + 3 Humanoids. A corpse flower can hold the remains of up to nine Humanoids. These remains have total cover against attacks and other effects outside the corpse flower. If the corpse flower dies, the corpses within it can be pulled free.

Spider Climb. The corpse flower can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

Stench of Death. Each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the corpse flower or one of its zombies must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, unless the creature is a Construct or an Undead. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the Stench of Death of all corpse flowers for 24 hours.

Actions

Multiattack. The corpse flower makes three Tentacle attacks.

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.

Harvest the Dead. The corpse flower swallows one unsecured Humanoid corpse within 10 feet of it, along with any equipment the corpse is wearing or carrying.

Bonus Actions

Digest. The corpse flower digests one corpse in its body and instantly regains 11 (2d10) hit points. Nothing of the digested corpse remains. Any equipment on the corpse is expelled from the corpse flower in its space.

Reanimate. The corpse flower animates one corpse in its body, turning it into a zombie (see the Monster Manual). The zombie appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the corpse flower and acts immediately after it in the initiative order. The zombie acts as an ally of the corpse flower but isn’t under its control, and the flower’s stench clings to it (see Stench of Death).


Cranium Rats
Mind flayers create cranium rats by bombarding rats with psionic energy. Cranium rats are somewhat smarter than ordinary rats and behave as such. If enough cranium rats come together to form a swarm, they merge their minds into a single intelligence with the accumulated memories of all the swarm’s constituents. The rats become smarter as a result, and retain their heightened intelligence for as long as the swarm persists. The swarm also awakens latent psionic abilities implanted within each cranium rat by its mind flayer creators, bestowing upon the swarm psionic powers.

Illumination. The cranium rat sheds dim light from its exposed brain in a 5-foot radius or extinguishes the light.

A single cranium rat uses its natural telepathy to communicate hunger, fear, and other base emotions. A swarm of cranium rats communicating telepathically “speaks” as one creature, often referring to itself using the collective pronouns “we” and “us.”

Some mind flayer colonies use cranium rats as spies. The rats invade communities and act as eyes and ears for the colony’s elder brain (appears in this book), transmitting their thoughts when they swarm and are within range of the elder brain’s telepathy.

1/day each: confusion, dominate monster

Bonus Actions

Illumination. The swarm sheds dim light from its brains in a 5-foot radius, increases the illumination to bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius (and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius), or extinguishes the light.


Monsters: D
Darklings
Ancient legends speak of a seelie fey who betrayed the Summer Queen. In the Summer Queens’ wrath, she cursed every member of his house. The seelie fey’s true name has been stricken from history, but the stories call him Dubh Catha (“Dark Crow” in Common), and other Fey refer to the house’s descendants as dubh sith—“darklings.” Darklings dwell in secluded caverns and chambers beneath the towns of other species. From such enclaves, they quietly ply their trade as thieves and assassins.

Darkling
The Summer Queen’s curse causes a darkling’s body to absorb light, which wizens the creature, much like the effect of rapid aging. For this reason, darklings cover their entire bodies with clothing when exposure to light is a risk. The light darklings absorb over the course of their lives explodes outward when they die, incinerating the creatures and much of their possessions.

Light Sensitivity. While in bright light, the darkling has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Actions

Dagger. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.


Darkling Elder
A wise and respected darkling can undergo a ritual to become an elder. Other elders mark the supplicant with glowing tattoos, channeling away some of the darkling’s absorbed light. If the ritual succeeds, the darkling grows into a taller, elf-like form. The darkling perishes if the ritual fails.

Death Burn. When the darkling elder dies, magical light flashes out from it in a 10-foot radius as its body and possessions, other than metal or magic objects, burn to ash. Any creature in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) radiant damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded.

Actions

Multiattack. The darkling elder makes two Scimitar attacks.

Scimitar. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

Darkness (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The darkling elder casts darkness, requiring no spell components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability.

Death Kiss
A death kiss is a lesser beholder that can come into being when a true beholder has a vivid nightmare about losing blood. Its coloration and shape resemble those of the beholder that dreamed it into existence, but its hue is more muted, and instead of magical eye rays, it has ten long tentacles, each ending in a mouth full of teeth. It can speak through any of its tentacle-maws in a high-pitched, nasal voice.


Death kisses fear true beholders, which can easily kill or subdue them. Lacking the egotism of their stronger kin, a death kiss usually submits to the rule of its creator or any other beholder it encounters, but it tries to escape as soon as the beholder is preoccupied.

A death kiss consumes ingested blood, which it also uses to heal and generate electrical energy inside its body. Terrified of dying from starvation, it obsessively drains even little creatures such as rats, leaving behind a trail of bloodless corpses. When underground, it uses its tentacles as feelers, prodding and examining the environment in all directions. Above ground, it usually keeps its tentacles retracted when on the hunt, then lashes out with them to catch opponents off guard.

A death kiss lacks the combat finesse and intelligence of a true beholder. In most cases, it simply latches on to its prey with one or more of its tentacles and drains blood until the prey collapses. If it’s in a superior position and its foe poses no threat, it might toy with its food, drawing out its prey’s death.

A death kiss prefers to hunt alone. If it meets another of its kind, it might fight, flee, or team up, depending on its health and pride.

Lightning Blood. A creature within 5 feet of the death kiss takes 5 (1d10) lightning damage whenever it hits the death kiss with a melee attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.

Actions

Multiattack. The death kiss makes three Tentacle attacks. Up to three of these attacks can be replaced by Blood Drain—one replacement per tentacle grappling a creature.

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Huge or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the death kiss can’t use the same tentacle on another target. The death kiss has ten tentacles.

Blood Drain. One creature grappled by a tentacle of the death kiss must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage, and the death kiss regains half as many hit points.

Deathlocks
The forging of a pact between a warlock and a patron is no minor occasion—at least not for the warlock. The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock who fails to live up to a bargain with an evil patron runs the risk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foul Undead driven to serve its otherworldly patron.

An powerful necromancer might also discover the wicked methods of creating a deathlock and then subjugate it, acting as the deathlock’s patron.

Deathlock
An overpowering urge to serve consumes the mind of a newly awakened deathlock. Any goals and ambitions it had in life that don’t please its patron fall away as its master’s desires become the purpose that drives it. The deathlock immediately resumes work on its patron’s behalf.

Whatever the goal, it always reflects the patron’s interests, ranging from small-scale concerns to matters of cosmic scope. A deathlock in the thrall of a Fiend might work to destroy a specific temple dedicated to a good god, while one that serves a Great Old One might hunt for the materials needed to call forth a horrifying entity into the world. To accomplish a difficult goal, the deathlock might be forced to serve another powerful creature or might need to gather servants of its own.

Deathlock Mastermind
Though deathlocks exist to serve their patrons, they retain some freedom when it comes to devising tactics and carrying out plans.

Deep Scion
Deep scions began life as people who were stolen from shore or saved from sinking ships and offered a terrible bargain by an undersea power: surrender, body and soul, or drown. Those who submit are subjected to an ancient ritual widespread among evil aquatic creatures. Its methods are painful and the result never certain, but when it works, the magic transforms an air-breathing person into a shape-shifter that can take on an aquatic form.

A deep scion emerges from the depths in service to their underwater master, which is likely a kraken or some other ancient being of the deep. While wearing the mind and body of the person they once were as a sort of mask, the creature is bent on fulfilling their master’s desires. Sometimes a deep scion returns to their former home—unexpectedly found alive when all hope was lost. At other times the deep scion takes on a new identity. In any case, it is the deep scion’s duty to infiltrate the air-breathing world and report back to their master. When set to this task, a deep scion worms their way into the life of an unsuspecting enemy as a new friend, a lover, the perfect candidate for a job, or some other role that enables the minion to carry out their master’s commands.

The training to which a deep scion is subjected rids it of empathy for those they spy on. Though a deep scion might behave as though infatuated, laugh at the joke of a friend, or appear incensed at some injustice, each of these acts is artificial to the deep scion, a means to an end. The creature believes that their true form is the shape they take when they return to the sea they think of as home. Ironically, however, a deep scion that is killed when in their piscine form is stripped of the magic that enabled them to transform, leaving behind the corpse of the person the deep scion once was.

Amphibious (Hybrid Form Only). The deep scion can breathe air and water.

Actions

Multiattack. The deep scion makes two Battleaxe attacks, or it makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

Battleaxe. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage if used with two hands.

Bite (Hybrid Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

Claw (Hybrid Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.

Psychic Screech (Hybrid Form Only; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The deep scion emits a terrible scream audible within 300 feet. Creatures within 30 feet of the deep scion must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of the deep scion’s next turn.

In water, the psychic screech also telepathically transmits the deep scion’s memories of the last 24 hours to its master, regardless of distance, so long as it and its master are in the same body of water.

Bonus Actions

Change Shape. The deep scion transforms into a hybrid form (humanoid-piscine) or back into its true form, which is humanlike. Its statistics, other than its speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. The deep scion reverts to its true form if it dies.


Demogorgon
Prince of Demons, the Sibilant Beast, and Master of the Spiraling Depths, Demogorgon is the embodiment of chaos, confusion, and destruction, seeking to corrupt all that is good and undermine order in the multiverse, to see everything dragged howling into the infinite depths of the Abyss.

The demon lord is a meld of different forms. He has a saurian lower body and clawed, webbed feet; suckered tentacles sprout from the shoulders of his great apelike torso, which is surmounted by two hideous simian heads named Aameul and Hathradiah. Their gaze brings bewilderment and confusion to any who confront them.

Similarly, the spiraling Y sign of Demogorgon’s cult drives those who contemplate it for too long to delirium. As a result, all followers of the Prince of Demons break with reality sooner or later.

Are two heads better than one? In Demogorgon’s case, the two double the horror and the chaos.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Demogorgon fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Resistance. Demogorgon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Two Heads. Demogorgon has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, deafened, stunned, or knocked unconscious.

Actions

Multiattack. Demogorgon makes two Tentacle attacks. He can replace one attack with a use of Gaze.

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (3d12 + 9) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

Gaze. Demogorgon turns his magical gaze toward one creature he can see within 120 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or suffer one of the following effects (choose one or roll a d6):

1–2: Beguiling Gaze. The target is stunned until the start of Demogorgon’s next turn or until Demogorgon is no longer within line of sight.

3–4: Confusing Gaze. The target suffers the effect of the confusion spell without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the start of Demogorgon’s next turn. Demogorgon doesn’t need to concentrate on the spell.

5–6: Hypnotic Gaze. The target is charmed by Demogorgon until the start of Demogorgon’s next turn. Demogorgon chooses how the charmed target uses its action, reaction, and movement.

Spellcasting. Demogorgon casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 23):

At will: detect magic, major image

3/day each: dispel magic, fear, telekinesis

1/day each: feeblemind, project image

Gaze. Demogorgon uses Gaze and must use either Beguiling Gaze or Confusing Gaze.

Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10) necrotic damage.

Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions). Demogorgon uses Spellcasting.


Demogorgon’s Lair
Demogorgon makes his lair in a palace called Abysm, found on a layer of the Abyss known as the Gaping Maw. Demogorgon’s lair is a place of confusion and duality; the portion of the palace that lies above water takes the form of two serpentine towers, each crowned by a skull-shaped minaret. There, Demogorgon’s heads contemplate the mysteries of the arcane while arguing about how best to obliterate their rivals. The bulk of this palace extends deep underwater, in chill and darkened caverns.

Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Demogorgon can take one of the following lair actions; he can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

Darkness. Demogorgon casts the darkness spell four times, targeting different areas with the spell. Demogorgon doesn’t need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round.

Illusory Duplicate. Demogorgon creates an illusory duplicate of himself, which appears in his space and lasts until initiative count 20 of the next round. On his turn, Demogorgon can move the illusory duplicate a distance equal to his walking speed (no action required). The first time a creature or an object interacts physically with Demogorgon (for example, by hitting him with an attack), there is a 50 percent chance that the illusory duplicate is affected, not Demogorgon, in which case the illusion disappears.

Regional Effects
The region containing Demogorgon’s lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

Beguiling Realm. Within 6 miles of the lair, all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Performance) checks have disadvantage, and all Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks have advantage.

Frenzied Animals. Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become frenzied and violent—even creatures that are normally docile. Within that area, any ability check involving Animal Handling has disadvantage.

Venomous Beasts. The area within 6 miles of the lair becomes overpopulated with poisonous snakes and other venomous Beasts.

If Demogorgon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

Cultists of Demogorgon
Demogorgon’s followers are typically lone killers driven by the whispering voice of their master. His most blessed followers gain the Two Minds of Chaos trait.

Two Minds of Chaos. This creature has advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

Derro

Derro slink through the subterranean realms, seeking places that are safe from the perils of the Underdark. Equal parts fearful and vicious, bands of these dwarf-kin prey on those weaker than themselves, while giving simpering obeisance to any creatures they deem more powerful. A lone derro may seem pitiable, but a cackling, spitting, growling, howling horde of them is horrifying to behold.

Fractious in groups and individually weak, derro would have died out long ago but for two elements of their character. They are cautious and distrustful, which serves them well as they navigate the dangers of the Underdark and its societies. They also have a stronger-than-normal tendency to develop sorcerous power. Individuals who do so usually serve as leaders and are known as savants.

Grandiose fantasies and rampant fanaticism have obscured derro’s true origin, even among themselves. Most dwarves don’t recognize derro as kin, but the legends that derro tell about their people and the story that duergar believe share a grain of truth. According to the histories of some duergar, derro are descended from a dwarven community that was left behind when the others escaped the rule of mind flayers. These remnants were so distorted by the mind flayers’ psionic power that the dwarves became Aberrations.

Derro tell their own stories of flight and survival in the Underdark, in which mind flayers aren’t always the enemy. They tell of two brothers, the gods Diirinka and Diinkarazan, and of how Diirinka cleverly betrayed his sibling so that he could steal magical power from the evil they escaped. The danger the brothers are said to face in this legend varies, depending on whatever foe the savants want to lead their people against, yet the essence of the story remains the same: a lesson of survival at any price and an example of how deceitfulness and cruelty can be virtues.

Mind flayers must be stopped. They have visited horrors on countless worlds, and entire groups of people have been mutated by illithid experiments. Such are the derro.

Whenever I’ve met them, I refuse to fight, no matter how violent they might be. I think of the dwarves they once were, and I must confess that even I have shed tears.

Devourer
Of all the abominations unleashed by Orcus (appears in this book), devourers are among the most feared. These tall, mummy-like Undead wander the planes, consuming souls and spreading Orcus’s creed of replacing all life with everlasting death.

A lesser demon that proves itself to Orcus might be granted the privilege of becoming a devourer. The Prince of Undeath transforms such a demon into an 8-foot-tall, desiccated biped with a hollowed-out ribcage, then fills the new creature with a hunger for souls. Orcus grants each new devourer the essence of a less fortunate demon to power the devourer’s first foray into the planes. Most devourers remain in the Abyss or on the Astral or Ethereal Plane, pursuing Orcus’s schemes and interests in those realms. When Orcus sends devourers to the Material Plane, he often sets them on a mission to create, control, and lead a plague of Undead. Skeletons, zombies, ghouls, ghasts, and shadows (all of which appear in the Monster Manual) are particularly attracted to the presence of a devourer.

Devourers hunt Humanoids with the intent of consuming them body and soul. After a devourer brings a target to the brink of death, it pulls the victim’s body in and traps the creature within its own ribcage. As the victim tries to stave off death (usually without success), the devourer tortures its soul with telepathic noise. When the victim expires, it undergoes a horrible transformation, springing forth from the devourer’s body to begin its new existence as an Undead servitor of the monster that spawned it.

Unusual Nature. A devourer doesn’t require air, drink, or sleep.

Actions

Multiattack. The devourer makes two Claw attacks and can use either Imprison Soul or Soul Rend, if available.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage.

Imprison Soul. The devourer chooses a living Humanoid with 0 hit points that it can see within 30 feet of it. That creature is teleported inside the devourer’s ribcage and imprisoned there. While imprisoned in this way, the creature is restrained and has disadvantage on death saving throws. If the creature dies while imprisoned, the devourer regains 25 hit points and immediately recharges Soul Rend. Additionally, at the start of its next turn, the devourer regurgitates the slain creature as a bonus action, and the creature becomes an Undead. If the victim had 2 or fewer Hit Dice, it becomes a zombie. If it had 3 to 5 Hit Dice, it becomes a ghoul. Otherwise, it becomes a wight. (All three appear in the Monster Manual.) A devourer can imprison only one creature at a time.

Soul Rend (Recharge 6). The devourer creates a vortex of life-draining energy in a 20-foot radius centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


Dhergoloth
A kind of yugoloth, dhergoloths rush into battle like whirlwinds of destruction, lashing out with the five sets of claws that extend from their squat, barrel-shaped bodies. They take contracts to put down uprisings, clear out rabble, and eliminate scouts and skirmishers, and they revel in the butchery they create, their gleeful laughter rising above their victims’ screams.

Since dhergoloths are little more than brutes, employers must use caution when instructing them. They can handle simple orders that don’t take a lot of time to resolve. When given anything complex to do, however, they either forget what they’re told or don’t listen in the first place, and then bungle the task that was set for them.

A dhergoloth’s head doesn’t turn along with its furiously spinning torso, and its torso can spin a different direction from its dancing legs.

I’d like to vivisect one at some point to find out how this can be.

Dolphin Delighter
In the Feywild, dolphin delighters brighten the moods of those who travel the seas of the Domains of Delight. Telepathically singing sea chanteys, these dolphins leap and teleport through the luminous waters of Faerie and the Material Plane, and they are faithful allies to any who battle the forces of gloom and brutality under the waves.

Draegloth
A draegloth is a demon created by an elf priest of Lolth in an unholy, dangerous ritual in which it is infused with the fey essence of the creator and the fiendish essence of a glabrezu. This ritual rarely succeeds, but Lolth’s faithful consider it worth the risk, as the resulting creature is gifted with innate magic and physical might. The draegloth usually serves its creator, lending its thirst for destruction to the creator’s plans to triumph over rivals.

A draegloth is an ogre-sized, four-armed biped with purple skin and pale hair. Two of its arms are muscular, tipped with sharp claws; the other two are the size and shape of an elf’s arms, capable of delicate movements. Although the creature is heavily muscled, it is graceful like an elf. Its bestial face features glowing red eyes, a doglike snout, and a mouth full of sharp teeth.

Among the drow noble houses of Menzoberranzan in the Forgotten Realms, a high priestess’s successful creation of a draegloth is seen as a sign of Lolth’s favor toward her house—and a sign of the demon lord’s disregard for the family’s rivals, who were not thus gifted. The creation prompts the leaders of the house to begin crafting new plans to strike at its rivals when the draegloth is fully grown. These plans use the draegloth in a significant role, because its abilities can turn the tide in a battle against a house that doesn’t have a draegloth of its own.

Although draegloths plays an important part in the plans of Lolth’s cult, a draegloth can’t rise above the status of a favored servant to a priest in that cult. Before a draegloth is given any duties, it receives instruction in accepting the role set for it and not challenging authority. Most draegloths fiercely resent being given orders, but thanks to their training, they typically take out their frustration on their creator’s enemies, rather than on their creator. A draegloth that can’t suppress its ambitions might abandon its creator and strike out on its own. Whether these rebellious draegloths are part of Lolth’s plan for sowing chaos is unclear.

At will: dancing lights, darkness

1/day each: confusion, faerie fire


Drow Arachnomancer

Drow spellcasters who seek to devote themselves wholly to Lolth, the Spider Queen, sometimes walk the sinister path of the arachnomancer. By offering up body and soul to Lolth, they gain tremendous power and a supernatural connection to the ancient spiders of the Demonweb Pits, channeling magic from that dread place.

Spider Climb. The drow can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Web Walker. The drow ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

Actions

Multiattack. The drow makes three attacks, using Bite, Poisonous Touch, Web, or a combination of them. One attack can be replaced by a use of Spellcasting.

Bite (Spider Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

Poisonous Touch (Humanoid Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (10d6) poison damage.

Web (Spider Form Only; Recharge 5–6). Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 15 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

Spellcasting. The drow casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

At will: dancing lights, mage hand

1/day each: darkness, dispel magic, etherealness, faerie fire, fly, insect plague, invisibility

Bonus Actions

Change Shape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The drow magically transforms into a Large spider, remaining in that form for up to 1 hour, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. It can speak and cast spells while in spider form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying in Humanoid form melds into the spider form. It can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. It reverts to its Humanoid form if it dies.


Drow Favored Consort
Nearly every priestess of Lolth, including the powerful drow matron mother in this book, takes an attractive drow as consort. Chosen as much for beauty as for magical might, a drow favored consort can hold their own in both conversation and combat. Combining the roles of advisor, protector, and beloved, some favored consorts are content with a supporting role, while more ambitious consorts aspire to be the power behind the throne—or even to claim the throne themselves.

Those favored consorts who prove their cunning gain the ear, and perhaps even the heart, of their priestess and are relied on to provide useful advice. No position of consort is assured for long, though; Lolth’s priestesses are notoriously fickle, and a consort must often contend with rivals.

Some favored consorts work behind the scenes to undermine the evils encouraged by Lolth. Others can be found in Underdark cities free of Lolth’s influence, where these powerful spellcasters apply their might toward ending her tyranny.

Actions

Multiattack. The drow makes three Scimitar or Arcane Eruption attacks. The drow can replace one of the attacks with a use of Spellcasting.

Scimitar. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 27 (6d8) poison damage.

Arcane Eruption. Ranged Spell Attack: +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (8d8) force damage, and the drow can push the target up to 10 feet away if it is a Large or smaller creature.

Spellcasting. The drow casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):

At will: dancing lights, mage armor, mage hand, message

3/day each: dimension door, fireball, invisibility

1/day each: darkness, faerie fire, levitate (self only)

Reactions

Protective Shield (3/Day). When the drow or a creature within 10 feet of it is hit by an attack roll, the drow gives the target a +5 bonus to its AC until the start of the drow’s next turn, which can cause the triggering attack roll to miss.


Drow House Captain
A drow house captain leads the troops of an Underdark faction, whether defending a stronghold or leading forces against enemies. These officers make extensive study of strategy and tactics to become effective leaders in battle.

Among Lolth’s devotees in the city of Menzoberranzan in the Forgotten Realms, each noble house entrusts the leadership of its military forces to a house captain, who is typically the first or second son of a drow matron mother (appears in this book). Elsewhere drow house captains fight in the war against Lolth, often allying with duergar and others who also wish to rid their subterranean world of that god’s malevolence.

Multiattack. The drow makes two Scimitar attacks and one Whip or Hand Crossbow attack.

Scimitar. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage.

Whip. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage.

Hand Crossbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it.

Spellcasting. The drow casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

At will: dancing lights

1/day each: darkness, faerie fire, levitate (self only)

Bonus Actions

Battle Command. Choose one creature within 30 feet of the drow that the drow can see. If the chosen creature can see or hear the drow, that creature can use its reaction to make one melee attack or to take the Dodge or Hide action.

Reactions

Parry. The drow adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack roll that would hit it. To do so, the drow must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.


House captains will do anything to protect their family—whether that’s their birth house or their platoon of scrappy rebels. I’d do anything for my (sometimes infuriating) mother and for my chosen family, so I admire their dedication.

TASHA

Drow Inquisitor
Lolth’s worshipers expect treachery—the Spider Queen encourages it, after all. A certain amount of backstabbing and double-crossing can be managed, but too much can undermine an entire community. To keep some semblance of order and to root out traitors, priestesses of Lolth employ inquisitors. Inquisitors are chosen from the ranks of the priesthood, and their authority is equaled only by that of the drow matron mothers (also in this book) of the noble houses. Anyone they decide is at odds with the hierarchy faces painful interrogation and usually an excruciating death.

Variant: Demon Summoning
Some drow inquisitors have an action that allows them to summon a yochlol.

Summon Demon (1/Day). The drow attempts to magically summon a yochlol (see the Monster Manual), with a 50 percent chance of success. If the attempt fails, the drow takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage. Otherwise, the summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can’t summon other demons. It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Actions

Multiattack. The drow makes three Death Lance attacks.

Death Lance. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

Spellcasting. The drow casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):

At will: dancing lights, detect magic, message, thaumaturgy

1/day each: clairvoyance, darkness, detect thoughts, dispel magic, faerie fire, levitate (self only), silence, suggestion, true seeing

Bonus Actions

Spectral Dagger (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). The drow conjures a floating, spectral dagger within 60 feet of itself. The drow can make a melee spell attack (+10 to hit) against one creature within 5 feet of the dagger. On a hit, the target takes 9 (1d8 + 5) force damage.

The dagger lasts for 1 minute. As a bonus action on later turns, the drow can move the dagger up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against one creature within 5 feet of the dagger.


Drow Matron Mother
Among drow followers of Lolth, each noble house is led by a matron mother, an influential priestess of Lolth charged with carrying out the god’s will while also advancing the interests of the family. Matron mothers embody the scheming and treachery associated with the Queen of Spiders. Each stands at the center of a vast conspiratorial web, with demons, spiders, and conscripted soldiers positioned between them and their enemies. Although matron mothers command great power, that power depends on maintaining the Spider Queen’s favor, and the goddess sometimes capriciously takes back what she has given. The stat block here represents a matron mother at the height of her power.

A matron mother is almost never encountered alone. She is typically accompanied by a drow favored consort and a drow house captain, each of whom appears in this book. Other Underdark creatures might also be in the priestess’s presence, providing protection or advice.

Mothers of Rebellion
Some matron mothers renounce Lolth and join the war against their former goddess. Such drow could be of any alignment, and they lose the following abilities in the stat block: Lolth’s Fickle Favor, Summon Servant, and Compel Demon. Even without these abilities, drow matron mothers are formidable opponents, and several of them hold positions of great influence in the Underdark armies arrayed against the followers of Lolth.

The target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the drow for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Tentacle Rod. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is hit three times by the rod on one turn, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer the following effects for 1 minute: the target’s speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions. Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Divine Flame (2/Day). A 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high column of divine fire sprouts in an area up to 120 feet away from the drow. Each creature in the column must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Spellcasting. The drow casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 20):

At will: command, dancing lights, detect magic, thaumaturgy

2/day each: banishment, blade barrier, cure wounds, hold person, plane shift, silence

1/day each: clairvoyance, darkness, detect thoughts, dispel magic, faerie fire, gate, levitate (self only), suggestion

Bonus Actions

Lolth’s Fickle Favor. The drow bestows the Spider Queen’s blessing on one ally she can see within 30 feet of her. The ally takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage but has advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

Summon Servant (1/Day). The drow magically summons a glabrezu or a yochlol (both appear in the Monster Manual). The summoned creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can’t summon other demons. It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

Legendary Actions

The drow can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The drow regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

Compel Demon. An allied demon within 30 feet of the drow uses its reaction to make one attack against a target of the drow’s choice that she can see.

Demon Staff. The drow makes one Demon Staff attack.

Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions). The drow uses Spellcasting.


A Matron Mother’s Lair
The palace of a drow matron mother is her home and fortress. Sigils throughout the building allow the matron mother to use the following lair actions while within it.

Any temple of Lolth also functions as a matron mother’s lair while she is inside it, unless she has renounced Lolth or another matron mother is present. When two or more matron mothers gather within a temple of their goddess, none of them can use it as their lair.

Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the drow can take one of the following lair actions when in her lair; she can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

Perceive Interlopers. The drow projects her mind throughout her lair, marking any potential threats against her or her retinue. Until initiative count 20 of the next round, hostile creatures within the lair can’t become hidden from her and gain no benefit from the invisible condition against her.

Spectral Web. A glistening spectral spider web erupts from a point the drow can see within 120 feet of her. Each creature within 60 feet of that point must succeed a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Telekinetic Throw. The drow targets one creature she can see within 60 feet of her and attempts to expel it from her presence. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be flung 2d6 × 10 feet through the air. A creature smashed into a solid object takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet moved. If released in midair, the creature takes falling damage as normal.

Drow Shadowblade
Drow shadowblades steal down the dim passages of the Underdark, bound on errands of mayhem. They protect enclaves and Underdark cities from enemies and track down thieves who make off with prized treasures. In the city of Menzoberranzan in the Forgotten Realms, noble houses often employ shadowblades to eliminate rivals from other houses. In communities free of Lolth’s sway, they serve as spies tasked with foiling the plots of that demon lord’s cult. In any role they take on, they move undetected until the moment they attack—and then they are the last thing their victims see.

A shadowblade gains their powers over shadow via a ritual in which they kill a shadow demon and mystically prevent it from re-forming in the Abyss, siphoning its essence into themselves.

Variant: Demon Summoning
Some drow shadowblades have an action that allows them to summon a demon.

Summon Shadow Demon (1/Day). The drow attempts to magically summon a shadow demon (see the Monster Manual) with a 50 percent chance of success. If the attempt fails, the drow takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage. Otherwise, the summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can’t summon other demons. It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it.

Spellcasting. The drow casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

At will: dancing lights, darkness

1/day each: faerie fire, levitate (self only)

Bonus Actions

Shadow Step. While in dim light or darkness, the drow teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see that is also in dim light or darkness. It then has advantage on the first melee attack it makes before the end of the turn.


Duergar

Duergar are dwarves of the deep reaches of the Underdark and other sunless realms. Their personalities and abilities have been deeply impacted by their ancestors’ captivity and torment by mind flayers; they were infused with powerful psionic abilities but also a profound gloom. In some, this strain of sorrow inspires works of grand but melancholic beauty, while in others, it manifests as rage.

Like many who dwell in the Underdark, duergar must constantly be on guard against the raids and plots of their neighbors. To this end, duergar warriors fulfill a variety of combat roles, often marrying their fury in battle with their psionic abilities or training dangerous Underdark creatures as mounts.

Denigrated by some as joyless, duergar are in fact deeply passionate in all that they do—even if that passion rarely manifests as mirth. They bring an emotional intensity to their lives, whether they’re exploring neighboring tunnels, defending their homes, engaging with their families, or crafting bold new works. The bonds of friendship and kinship are strong, though navigating the inevitable outbursts of frustration and despair is not always easy. Similarly, duergar tend to be very community-minded—in the Underdark, all must cooperate to survive.

Among the duergar of the Forgotten Realms, creation is a fiercely passionate process. They tend to favor works that are sturdy and grand, but in a bare, stripped-down fashion that favors geometric forms. The strongholds they design are blocky and stark, and the weapons they forge are blatantly tools of violence. While others may decry their creations as cold and bare of ornamentation to the point of austerity, duergar see them as honoring the materials used and honest about their purpose.

At will: mage hand, minor illusion

1/day: stinking cloud

Duergar Kavalrachni
Kavalrachni are duergar cavalry trained to fight while riding female steeders (in this book) or other Underdark creatures as mounts.

Duergar architecture is remarkable for its brutalist grandeur. It is not a style I would use for my towers—I prefer gold, gems, and tracery—but I admire the boldness of dwarven stonework.

The invisibility ends early on the mount immediately after it attacks.

Duergar Mind Master
Wearing fearsome masks, duergar mind masters usually operate as spies, both inside and beyond a duergar stronghold. Their psionically augmented abilities enable them to see through illusions with ease and shrink down to miniature size to spy on their targets.

Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.

Duergar Stone Guard
Stone guards are elite troops deployed in small numbers to bolster war bands of regulars or organized into elite strike forces for specific missions.

The mental power that duergar wield was given to them by illithids. But why would illithids create servants who could turn invisible or grow to ogre size?

Most likely because those servants would excel at herding their masters’ other minions. In retrospect, it seems arguable that duergar escaped bondage because their jailers had given them the keys.

Duergar Constructs
Creative duergar engineers have built numerous war machines, including some that can be fused with a duergar. Such a duergar-machine hybrid is fueled by the duergar’s psionic energy, and the duergar inside the machine can psychically channel pain into power when attacked.

These machines are deployed to assist with construction projects and war. Some duergar bravely volunteer to become hybrids, while other duergar are forced into the fusion by Underdark tyrants.

Unless incapacitated, the duergar inside a machine can extricate themself from it over the course of a short rest, completing the process at the rest’s end.

Dybbuk
Dybbuks are demons that terrorize mortals on the Material Plane by possessing corpses and giving them a semblance of life, after which the demons use them to engage in a range of sordid activities.

In their natural form, dybbuks appear as translucent flying jellyfish, trailing long tentacles as they move through the air. They rarely travel in this fashion, however. Instead, a dybbuk possesses a suitable corpse as a vehicle, rousing the body from death. Dybbuks delight in terrorizing other creatures by making their host bodies behave in horrifying ways—throwing up gouts of blood, excreting piles of squirming maggots, and contorting their limbs in impossible ways as they scuttle across the ground.

Incorporeal Movement. The dybbuk can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

Magic Resistance. The dybbuk has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Action

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, its hit point maximum is also reduced by 3 (1d6). This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

Possess Corpse (Recharge 6). The dybbuk disappears into an intact corpse within 5 feet of it that belonged to a Large or smaller Beast or Humanoid. The dybbuk gains 20 temporary hit points. While possessing the corpse, the dybbuk adopts the corpse’s size and can’t use Incorporeal Movement. Its game statistics otherwise remain the same.

The possession lasts until the temporary hit points are lost or the dybbuk ends it as a bonus action. When the possession ends, the dybbuk appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the corpse.

Spellcasting. The dybbuk casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

At will: dimension door

3/day: phantasmal force

Bonus Actions

Control Corpse. While Possess Corpse is active, the dybbuk makes the corpse do something unnatural, such as vomit blood, twist its head all the way around, or cause a quadruped to move as a biped. Any Beast or Humanoid that sees this behavior must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the dybbuk for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this ability is immune to Control Corpse for 24 hours.
