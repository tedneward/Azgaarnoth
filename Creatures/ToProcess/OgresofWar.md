# Ogres of War
Ogres love to rush headlong into battle, but with enough time and patience, some of them learn to carry out specialized missions. The names they are given--the battering ram, the bolt launcher, the chain brute, and the howdah--reflect their particular functions. These jobs are tailored to take advantage of an ogre's strengths.

## Ogre Battering Ram
An ogre battering ram carries an enormous club that's primarily used for bashing doors into kindling but also works well for smashing foes. These ogres are drilled in two simple tasks: rushing forward to shatter enemy fortifications and using their weapons to force an advancing enemy to halt.

## Ogre Bolt Launcher
A bolt launcher carries a gigantic crossbow--a weapon so large it's essentially an ogre-held ballista. An ogre bolt launcher can load this immense weapon and loose its deadly missile as quickly as a dwarf handles a crossbow. The bolts are so large that few ogres can carry more than a half dozen at a time, but bolt launchers have been known to uproot small trees or tear beams out of buildings and launch those when their ammunition runs low.

## Ogre Chain Brute
An ogre chain brute wields a great spiked chain, swinging it with both hands in a wide circle to knock foes off their feet. Alternatively, the ogre can swing the chain in a crushing overhead smash.

>Chain Smash (Recharge 6). Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target repeats the saving throw if it takes damage and at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
>Chain Sweep. The ogre swings its chain, and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

## Ogre Howdah
The most unusual of the specialized ogres, the howdah carries a palisaded wooden fort on its back. The fort serves as a fighting platform for up to four Small people. Ogre howdahs are most often seen bearing bow- and spear-wielding goblins into battle, or perhaps kobolds or deep gnomes (all three appear in the Monster Manual), but they might also transport other Small folk.

>Howdah. The ogre carries a compact fort on its back. Up to four Small creatures can ride in the fort without squeezing. To make a melee attack against a target within 5 feet of the ogre, they must use spears or weapons with reach. Creatures in the fort have three-quarters cover against attacks and effects from outside it. If the ogre dies, creatures in the fort are placed in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the ogre.
