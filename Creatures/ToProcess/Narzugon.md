## Narzugon
Paladins who make deals with devils and carry their twisted sense of honor into the afterlife are especially valuable to the archdukes of the Nine Hells. These narzugons act as horrific perversions of knights errant, carrying out their masters' will.

Narzugons wield hell-forged lances that shunt the souls of any they killed to the River Styx for rebirth as lemures (see the Monster Manual). Every lance bears the marks of both a narzugon and its master.

Each narzugon claims a nightmare (see the Monster Manual) as its mount. These steeds are bound by infernal tack (see below) and must respond to the summons and commands of the spurs' wearer.

Magic Item: Infernal Tack

Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Creature of Evil Alignment)

A rider binds a nightmare to its service with infernal tack, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, and stirrups, along with spurs that are worn by the rider. A nightmare equipped with infernal tack must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed.

You can use an action to call a nightmare equipped with infernal tack by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.

The tack doesn't conjure a nightmare; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become true partners in evil.

>Infernal Tack. The narzugon wears spurs that are part of infernal tack, which allow it to summon its nightmare companion as an action.
>
>Magic Resistance. The narzugon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
>#### Actions
>Multiattack. The narzugon makes three Hellfire Lance attacks. It also uses Infernal Command or Terrifying Command.
>
>Hellfire Lance. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage plus 16 (3d10) fire damage. If this damage kills a creature with a soul, the soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure (see the Monster Manual) in Avernus in 1d4 hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a wish spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.
>
>Infernal Command. Each ally of the narzugon within 60 feet of it can't be charmed or frightened until the end of the narzugon's next turn.
>
>Terrifying Command. Each creature within 60 feet of the narzugon that isn't a Fiend must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or become frightened of the narzugon for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that makes a successful saving throw is immune to this narzugon's Terrifying Command for 24 hours.
>
>Healing (1/Day). The narzugon, or one creature it touches, regains 100 hit points.
