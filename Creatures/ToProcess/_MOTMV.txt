Vampiric Mist
In billowing clouds of fog lurk vampiric mists, the wretched remnants of vampires that were prevented from finding rest. Indistinguishable from the mists they lurk within, they strike unseen and undetected to bleed their victims dry.

Vampiric mists, sometimes called crimson mists, are all that remain of vampires who couldn’t return to their burial places after being defeated or suffering some mishap. Denied the restorative power of these places, the vampires’ bodies dissolve into mist. The transformation strips the intelligence and personality from them until only an unholy, insatiable thirst for blood remains.

Indistinguishable from fog aside from the charnel reek it exudes, a vampiric mist descends on a creature and causes the blood in the creature’s body to ooze through its pores or spill out from its eyes, nose, and mouth. This blood wafts out from the victim like crimson smoke, which the mist then consumes. The feeding causes no pain or discomfort to the victim, so vampiric mists can feed on sleepers without waking them. The more a mist feeds, the redder it gets, such that it turns pink, then red, and finally a deep scarlet hue; when sated, it rains blood droplets wherever it goes.

Like sharks in water, vampiric mists can scent blood from up to a mile away. Any injury, no matter how small, might catch their attention and draw them toward their victims. In battle, a mist focuses its attacks on injured targets, since open wounds are a more ready source of blood.

Life Sense. The mist can sense the location of any creature within 60 feet of it, unless that creature’s type is Construct or Undead.

Forbiddance. The mist can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

Misty Form. The mist can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can pass through it without squeezing. Each foot of movement in water costs it 2 extra feet, rather than 1 extra foot. The mist can’t manipulate objects in any way that requires fingers or manual dexterity.

Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The mist takes 10 radiant damage whenever it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, the mist has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

Unusual Nature. The mist doesn’t require air or sleep.

Actions

Life Drain. The mist touches one creature in its space. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw (Undead and Constructs automatically succeed), or it takes 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage, the mist regains 10 hit points, and the target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.


Vargouille

Shrieking, flapping, and hideous to behold—with a body like a severed head and wings in place of ears—vargouilles boil out of the Abyss to infest other planes of existence, such as Carceri, where they are a menace. Each vargouille carries a disease that creates more of its kind; a flock of vargouilles on the wing is a plague of chaos and evil.

Swarms of vargouilles flap through the caverns and skies of the Abyss. They are given little regard by powerful and intelligent demons since vargouilles can do them no harm. Even the weakest demon, such as a manes or a dretch, fears vargouilles only if they appear in great numbers. In the Lower Planes, vargouilles rarely get the chance to eat live prey other than vermin. More often, they lap up the ichor left behind when one Fiend kills another.

Because of their hunger for living prey, vargouilles are eager to escape the Lower Planes. On rare occasions, summoning a demon to another plane can bring a vargouille along for the ride, attached like a tick. The precautions a mortal takes to control a summoned demon rarely account for a stowaway, enabling the vargouille to escape into the world.

Vargouilles that roam free on the Material Plane are a dire threat to all creatures. Their awful shrieking can paralyze other creatures with fear, which also makes the creatures susceptible to the vargouille’s curse. If the curse is allowed to run its course, an abyssal spirit invades the person’s body, causing a gruesome transformation. Over a period of hours, the victim’s head takes on fiendish aspects, such as fangs, tentacles, and horns. At the same time, the person’s ears grow larger, expanding into wing-like appendages. In the final moments, the victim’s head tears away from the body in a fountain of blood, becoming another vargouille, which often then eagerly laps up the blood spilling from its former body. Sunlight or the brilliant illumination of a daylight spell can delay this transformation; otherwise, only magic can overcome the curse.

Challenge 1 (200 XP) Proficiency Bonus +2

Actions

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.

Abyssal Curse. The vargouille targets one incapacitated Humanoid within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target loses 1 point of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects. The curse doesn’t advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a daylight spell; don’t count that time. When the cursed target’s Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille. Casting remove curse, greater restoration, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete can end the curse. Doing so undoes the changes made to the target by the curse.

Stunning Shriek (Recharge 5–6). The vargouille shrieks. Each Humanoid and Beast within 30 feet of the vargouille and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the vargouille until the end of the vargouille’s next turn. While frightened in this way, a target is stunned. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Stunning Shriek of all vargouilles for 1 hour.

Vegepygmies
Vegepygmies are fungus creatures that live in simple bands, hunting for sustenance and spreading the spores by which they reproduce. Also called mold folk or moldies, vegepygmies inhabit dark, moist areas, so they’re most commonly found underground or in forests where little sunlight penetrates. A vegepygmy feels kinship with other plant and fungus creatures, and thus vegepygmy bands coexist well with creatures such as myconid adults, shriekers, and violet fungi (all appear in the Monster Manual).

Although they prefer to eat fresh meat, bone, and blood, vegepygmies can absorb nutrients from soil and many sorts of organic matter, so they rarely go hungry. A vegepygmy can hiss and make other noises by forcing air through its mouth, but it can’t speak in a conventional sense. Among themselves, vegepygmies communicate by hissing, gestures, and tapping. Vegepygmies build and craft little; any gear they have is acquired from other creatures or built by copying simple construction they have witnessed.


Vegepygmy
Typical vegepygmies originate from the remains left behind when a Humanoid or a Giant is killed by russet mold (see “Russet Mold” below). One or more vegepygmies emerge from the corpse a day later.

Plant Camouflage. The vegepygmy has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes in any terrain with ample obscuring vegetation.

Regeneration. The vegepygmy regains 3 hit points at the start of its turn. If it takes cold, fire, or necrotic damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vegepygmy’s next turn. The vegepygmy dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

Actions

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

Sling. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

Vegepygmy Chief
As a vegepygmy ages, it grows tougher and develops spore clusters on its body. Other vegepygmies defer to these so-called chiefs. A chief can expel its spores in a burst, infecting nearby creatures. If a creature dies while infected, its corpse produces vegepygmies the same way russet mold does.

Regeneration. The vegepygmy regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn. If it takes cold, fire, or necrotic damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vegepygmy’s next turn. The vegepygmy dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

Actions

Multiattack. The vegepygmy makes two Claw attacks or two melee Spear attacks.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

Spear. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

Spores (1/Day). A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vegepygmy. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area that isn’t a Plant must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a target takes 9 (2d8) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Thorny Vegepygmy
If a Beast such as a dog or a bear dies from russet mold, the result is a bestial moldy called a thorny, instead of a bipedal vegepygmy. Thornies are less intelligent than other vegepygmies, but they are larger and more ferocious and have thorn-covered bodies.

Regeneration. The thorny regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn. If it takes cold, fire, or necrotic damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the thorny’s next turn. The thorny dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

Thorny Body. At the start of its turn, the thorny deals 2 (1d4) piercing damage to any creature grappling it.

Actions

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d8 + 1) piercing damage.

Russet Mold
Few know for sure where russet mold came from. One historical account tells of adventurers in a mountain range discovering russet mold and vegepygmies in a peculiar metal dungeon full of strange life. Another story says that explorers found russet mold in a crater left by a falling star, with vegepygmies infesting the forest nearby.

The mold is found only in places that are dark, warm, and wet. Russet mold that spreads out across a metal object can be mistaken for rust, and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check is required to identify it.

Effects of the Mold
Any creature that comes within 5 feet of russet mold must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw as the mold emits a puff of spores. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any magic that neutralizes poison or cures disease kills the infestation. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by the mold dies. If the dead creature is a Beast, a Giant, or a Humanoid, one or more vegepygmies emerge from its body 24 hours later: one from a Small corpse, two from a Medium corpse, four from a Large corpse, eight from a Huge corpse, or sixteen from a Gargantuan corpse.

Destroying the Mold
Russet mold can be hard to kill, since weapons and most types of damage do it no harm. Effects that deal acid, necrotic, or radiant damage kill 1 square foot of russet mold per 1 damage dealt. A pound of salt, a gallon of alcohol, or magic that cures disease kills russet mold in a square area that is 10 feet on a side. Sunlight kills any russet mold in the light’s area.

War Priest

War priests worship deities of war, protection, and strategy. They plan tactics, lead soldiers into battle, confront enemy spellcasters, and tend to casualties. A war priest might command an army or serve as the right hand of a warlord (appears in this book) on the battlefield.

War priests typically adorn themselves with a symbol of their faith. You can roll on the War Priest Holy Symbols table below, or choose one that fits your campaign.

War Priest Holy Symbols

Holy Fire. The war priest targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 12 (2d8 + 3) radiant damage, and it is blinded until the start of the war priest’s next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded.

Spellcasting. The war priest casts one of the following spells, using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

At will: light, spare the dying, thaumaturgy

Bonus Actions

Healing Light (2/Day). The war priest or one creature of its choice within 60 feet of it regains 12 (2d8 + 3) hit points.

Warlocks
Warlocks gain arcane might through magical pacts with mysterious entities. While some use their abilities to serve the sources of their power, others use them to undermine or even destroy these entities.

Warlock of the Archfey
Warlocks of the Archfey gain their powers through magical pacts forged with lords of the Feywild. These warlocks commonly associate with lesser Fey creatures such as boggles, quicklings, and redcaps (all appear in this book) or even satyrs and sprites (both appear in the Monster Manual).

Reactions

Misty Escape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). In response to taking damage, the warlock turns invisible and teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. It remains invisible until the start of its next turn or until it attacks, makes a damage roll, or casts a spell.

Warlock of the Fiend
Warlocks of the Fiend gain their powers through magical pacts forged with archfiends of the Lower Planes. These warlocks often keep imps or quasits (see the Monster Manual) as companions, and they tend toward philosophical extremes: consorting with fiendish cults or dedicating their lives to destroying such cults.

Scimitar. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.

Hellfire. Green flame explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 120 feet of the warlock. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) fire damage and 11 (2d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Spellcasting. The warlock casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

Fiendish Rebuke (3/Day). In response to being damaged by a visible creature within 60 feet of it, the warlock forces that creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


Warlock of the Great Old One
Warlocks of the Great Old One gain their powers through magical pacts forged with eldritch entities from strange and distant realms of existence. Some of these warlocks associate with cultists devoted to these entities, as well as Aberrations that share their goals, yet other warlocks of the Great Old One are experts at rooting out the chaos and wickedness inspired by bizarre beings from beyond the stars.

Warlord
Warlords are legendary battlefield commanders, whose names are spoken with awe. After a string of decisive victories, a warlord could easily take on the role of monarch or general and attract followers willing to die for the warlord’s banner.

Warlords urge their troops into the fray with shouted exhortations. You can roll on the Warlord Battle Cries table to select one, or choose a battle cry that fits with your campaign.

Weapon Attack. The warlord makes one Greatsword or Shortbow attack.

Frighten Foe (Costs 2 Actions). The warlord targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see or hear it, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the warlord until the end of warlord’s next turn.


Wastrilith
Found in the waters of the Abyss and other bodies of water contaminated by that plane’s fell influence, wastriliths establish themselves as lords of the deep and rule their dominions with cruelty.

A wastrilith pollutes the waters around it. Its noxious presence even affects nearby sources of water when the demon travels on land. The corrupted water, which contains a measure of the demon’s essence, responds to the wastrilith’s commands—perhaps hardening to prevent foes from escaping or erupting in a surge that drags victims into its reach.

Creatures that ingest water corrupted by a wastrilith risk their very souls. Those who drink the poisonous liquid might wither away until they finally die, or they remain alive only to become thralls of chaos and evil. To represent this defilement, you can use the optional rule on abyssal corruption in chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, causing the poisoned creature to be corrupted.

Amphibious. The wastrilith can breathe air and water.

Corrupt Water. At the start of each of the wastrilith’s turns, exposed water within 30 feet of it is befouled. Underwater, this effect lightly obscures the area until a current clears it away. Water in containers remains corrupted until it evaporates.

A creature that consumes this foul water or swims in it must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the foul water for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of this time, the poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 18 (4d8) poison damage and is poisoned until it finishes a long rest.

If another demon drinks the foul water as an action, it gains 11 (2d10) temporary hit points.

Magic Resistance. The wastrilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Multiattack. The wastrilith makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, and it uses Grasping Spout.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (4d12 + 4) piercing damage.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d6 + 4) slashing damage.

Grasping Spout. The wastrilith magically launches a spout of water at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw, and it has disadvantage if it’s underwater. On a failed save, it takes 22 (4d8 + 4) acid damage and is pulled up to 60 feet toward the wastrilith.

Wizards
Wizards pursue magical power through the study of arcane texts. Some travel the world searching for esoteric tomes, while others train lesser wizards or collaborate with colleagues to create new spells.

Apprentice Wizard
Apprentices are novice arcane spellcasters who serve more experienced wizards or attend school. They perform menial work like cooking or cleaning in exchange for education in the ways of magic.

The elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the conjurer, whom it obeys. It takes its turn immediately after the conjurer. It lasts for 1 hour, until it or the conjurer dies, or until the conjurer dismisses it as a bonus action.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (10d8) psychic damage and is stunned until the end of the diviner’s next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned.

Sculpted Explosion (Recharge 4–6). The evoker unleashes a magical explosion of a particular damage type: cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. The magic erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 150 feet of the evoker. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The evoker can select up to three creatures it can see in the area to ignore the explosion, as the evoker sculpts the energy around them. On a failed save, a creature takes 40 (9d8) damage of the chosen type and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

Spellcasting. The evoker casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

The effect lasts for 1 minute, and it ends early if the illusionist takes damage, if it is incapacitated, or if its speed becomes 0.

Necromancer Wizard

Wood Woad
A wood woad is a powerful bipedal Plant invested with the soul of someone who gave up life to become an everlasting guardian.

The ritual to create a wood woad is a primeval secret passed down through generations of forest-dwelling societies and druid circles. Performing the ritual isn’t necessarily an evil act if the victim-to-be is a willing sacrifice.

In the ritual, a living person’s chest is pierced and the heart removed. A seed is pushed into the heart, which is then placed in a tree. Any hollow or crook will do, but often a special cavity is carved out of the trunk. The tree is bathed and watered with the blood of the sacrificed victim, and the body is buried among the tree’s roots. After three days, a sprout emerges from the ground at the base of the tree and swiftly grows into a bipedal form.

This new body, armored in tough bark and bearing a gnarled club and shield, is at once ready to perform its duty. The one who performed the ritual sets the wood woad to its task, and the creature follows those orders unceasingly.

A wood woad has a hole where its heart would be, just as does the body of its former self, buried in the earth. Those who become wood woads trade their free will and all sense of sentiment for supernatural strength and a deathless duty. They exist only to protect woodlands and the people who tend them. A wood woad’s face is void and expressionless, except for the motes of light that swim about in its eye sockets. Wood woads speak little, and when not called on to take action, they root themselves in the earth and silently take sustenance from it.

Like trees, wood woads need only sunlight, air, and nutrients from the earth to go on living. Because they are undying, some wood woads outlive their original purpose. The site a wood woad guards might lose its power or significance over time, or those whom it was assigned to guard might die. If it is freed from its specific duties, a wood woad might roam to find another place of natural beauty or fey influence to watch over.

Wood woads are drawn to creatures that have close ties to nature and that protect and respect the land, such as druids and treants (both appear in the Monster Manual). Some treants have wood woad servants by virtue of age-old pacts with druids or Fey that performed the rituals, while others acquire the services of freed wood woads that find renewed purpose in serving a kindred guardian.

Plant Camouflage. The wood woad has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes in any terrain with ample obscuring vegetation.

Regeneration. The wood woad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it is in contact with the ground. If the wood woad takes fire damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the wood woad’s next turn. The wood woad dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

Tree Stride. Once on each of its turns, the wood woad can use 10 feet of its movement to step magically into one living tree within 5 feet of it and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of it that it can see, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or bigger.

Actions

Monsters: X
Xvarts
Xvarts are cowardly, greedy creatures spawned by a renegade demigod, Raxivort. They have blue skin, orange eyes, and receding hairlines, mirroring their creator’s appearance. They stand about 3 feet tall.

Raxivort spent centuries watching over the treasury of Graz’zt (appears in this book), and in time, Raxivort plundered his lord’s vault. One of the treasures he stole was the Infinity Spindle, a crystalline shard that could transform even a creature as lowly as Raxivort into a demigod. After his apotheosis, Raxivort forged the Black Sewers, a realm within Pandemonium that he filled with his beloved creatures, rats and bats, which xvarts befriend to this day. He enjoyed his reign only briefly before Graz’zt unleashed his vengeance. The demon prince urged villains far and wide to pursue the Infinity Spindle for themselves and destroy Raxivort.

Xvart
Fleeing his pursuers, Raxivort wandered across the multiverse and spawned xvarts, who not only look like him but also cause any magic that could reveal his location to point to the nearest xvart instead.

Monsters: Y
Yagnoloth
Anyone who would contract yugoloths for a task usually ends up dealing with a yagnoloth. Cunning negotiators, these strange Fiends handle the writing of contracts for their fellow yugoloths. Once a yagnoloth is hired, it communicates its employer’s desires to the yugoloths it commands.

Although they are entrusted with leading lesser yugoloths, yagnoloths ultimately take their orders from arcanaloths and ultroloths. Aside from their superiors, yagnoloths have full authority over and expect obedience from the yugoloths under their command. Yagnoloths follow the dictates of the contracts they negotiate but always include a loophole to escape their obligations if the situation warrants.

A yagnoloth has one arm of human size and one giant-sized arm. During negotiations, the yagnoloth uses its human-sized arm to draft and sign contracts. When a show of force is necessary or when combat is joined, it attacks with its brutally powerful giant arm.

Life Leech. The yagnoloth touches one incapacitated creature within 15 feet of it. The target takes 36 (7d8 + 4) necrotic damage, and the yagnoloth gains temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to half the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest, and the target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

Yeenoghu
The Beast of Butchery appears as a great scarred gnoll, towering 14 feet tall. Yeenoghu is the Gnoll Lord, and his creations are made in his twisted image. When the demon lord hunted across the Material Plane, packs of hyenas followed in his wake, and those that ate of great Yeenoghu’s kills became gnolls. Few others worship the Beast of Butchery, but those who do tend to take on a gnoll-like aspect, hunching over and filing their teeth down to points.

Yeenoghu wants nothing more than slaughter and senseless destruction. Gnolls are his favorite instruments, and he drives his gnoll followers to ever-greater atrocities in his name, even imbuing some of their commanders with his powers, which transforms them into flinds (in this book). Yeenoghu takes pleasure in causing fear before death, and he sows sorrow and despair through destroying beloved things. He doesn’t parlay; to meet him is to do battle with him—unless he becomes bored and wanders away. The Beast of Butchery has a long rivalry with Baphomet, the Horned King (appears in this book), and the two demon lords and their followers attack one another on sight.

The Gnoll Lord is covered in matted fur and leathery hide, and his face resembles a grinning predator’s skull. He wields a triple-headed flail called the Butcher, which he can summon into his hand at will, although he is as likely to tear his prey apart with his teeth.

Confusion. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the confusion spell until the start of Yeenoghu’s next turn.

Force. The target takes an extra 13 (2d12) force damage.

Paralysis. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the start of Yeenoghu’s next turn.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) acid damage.

Spellcasting. Yeenoghu casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

At will: detect magic

3/day each: dispel magic, fear, invisibility

1/day: teleport

Bonus Actions

Rampage. When Yeenoghu reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, he moves up to half his speed and makes one Bite attack.

Legendary Actions

Yeenoghu can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Yeenoghu regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

Charge. Yeenoghu moves up to his speed.

Swat Away. Yeenoghu makes one Flail attack. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet in a straight line away from Yeenoghu. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also knocked prone.

Savage (Costs 2 Actions). Yeenoghu makes a separate Bite attack against each creature within 10 feet of him.


Yeenoghu’s Lair
Yeenoghu’s lair in the Abyss is called the Death Dells. Its barren hills and ravines serve as a hunting ground, where he pursues captured mortals in a cruel game. Yeenoghu’s lair is a place of blood and death, populated by gnolls, hyenas, and ghouls (see the Monster Manual), and there are few structures or signs of civilization on his layer of the Abyss.

The challenge rating of Yeenoghu is 25 (75,000 XP) when he’s encountered in his lair.

Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Yeenoghu can take one of the following lair actions; he can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

Incite the Pack. Until the next initiative count 20, all gnolls and hyenas within the lair are enraged, causing them to have advantage on melee weapon attack rolls and causing attack rolls to have advantage against them.

Iron Spike. Yeenoghu causes an iron spike—5 feet tall and 1 inch in diameter—to burst from the ground at a point he can see within 100 feet of him. Any creature in the space where the spike emerges must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) piercing damage and is restrained by being impaled on the spike. A creature can use an action to remove itself (or a creature it can reach) from the spike, ending the restrained condition.

Pack Rush. Each gnoll or hyena that Yeenoghu can see can use its reaction to move up to its speed.

Regional Effects
The region containing Yeenoghu’s lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

Savage Predators. Predatory beasts within 6 miles of the lair become unusually savage, killing far more than what they need for food. Carcasses of prey are left to rot in an unnatural display of wasteful slaughter.

Spiky Terrain. Within 1 mile of the lair, large iron spikes grow out of the ground and stone surfaces. Yeenoghu impales the bodies of the slain on these spikes.

If Yeenoghu dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

Cultists of Yeenoghu
Yeenoghu grants special abilities to his cultists. His most devoted followers gain the Gnashing Jaws action and the Rampage bonus action, while cult leaders gain the Aura of Bloodthirst trait.

Gnashing Jaws. Melee Weapon Attack: bonus to hit equal to this creature’s proficiency bonus plus its Strength modifier, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d4 + this creature’s Strength modifier piercing damage.

Rampage. When this creature reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, it can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make one Gnashing Jaws attack.

Aura of Bloodthirst. If this creature isn’t incapacitated, any creature that has Rampage can make its Gnashing Jaws attack as a bonus action while within 10 feet of this creature.

Yeth Hound
Granted by mighty Fey to individuals who please them, yeth hounds serve their masters like hunting dogs. They race in pursuit of their prey, running it down until it’s too exhausted to fight back. Only the threat of dawn drives the pack back into hiding.

A pack of yeth hounds can be created by powerful Fey such as the Queen of Air and Darkness. Each pack’s master can telepathically communicate with their yeth hounds to give the pack commands from afar. If a pack’s master is killed, the hounds seek out a new master, typically an evil vampire, necromancer, or hag.

A yeth hound stands about 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs around 400 pounds. Its head has a human-like face and glowing red eyes. The creature gives off a smoky odor.

Yeth hounds make a ghastly baying sound that causes most creatures to flee in terror. They chase those who run and torment them before closing in for the kill. Those that fight back discover that mundane weapons partially pass through yeth hounds as if they were made of fog, but magic weapons and silvered weapons can strike true.

Yeth hounds can’t stand sunlight. A pack hunts at night and seeks to return to its dark den before dawn. If a yeth hound is exposed to natural sunlight, it fades away, vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, and its master can retrieve it only after sunset.

Sunlight Banishment. If the yeth hound starts its turn in sunlight, it is transported to the Ethereal Plane. While sunlight shines on the spot from which it vanished, the hound must remain in the Deep Ethereal. After sunset, it returns to the Border Ethereal at the same spot, whereupon it typically sets out to find its pack or its master. The hound is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, but it can’t affect or be affected by anything on the other plane. Once it is adjacent to its master or a pack mate that is on the Material Plane, a yeth hound in the Border Ethereal can return to the Material Plane as an action.

Telepathic Bond. While the yeth hound is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically with each other.

Actions

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, plus 14 (4d6) psychic damage if the target is frightened.

Baleful Baying. The yeth hound bays magically. Every enemy within 300 feet of the hound that can hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the hound until the end of the hound’s next turn or until the hound is incapacitated. A frightened target that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hound must use all its movement on that turn to get as far from the hound as possible, must finish the move before taking an action, and must take the most direct route, even if hazards lie that way. A target that successfully saves is immune to the baying of all yeth hounds for the next 24 hours.


Yuan-ti Anathema
As part of their quest for godhood, a yuan-ti abomination might perform a ritual that, if successful, transforms them into an even greater form: a yuan-ti anathema. This ritual demands the sacrifice of hundreds of snakes and requires the abomination to bathe in the blood of their enemies. The transformation is quick but painful.

Anathemas consider themselves demigods on the path to greater divinity. They demand obeisance from weaker creatures and use every resource at their disposal to war against neighbors, seeking the captives, sacrifices, glory, and riches the anathemas believe they need to achieve true divinity.

Anathemas don’t age, allowing them to pursue their goals until the end of days. Truly powerful ones might rule multiple yuan-ti cities and bring entire regions under their control.

Tasha once likened histachii to the bees that tend to larvae in beehives. It is a fanciful view of a horrific process.

A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this anathama’s aura for the next 24 hours.

Yuan-ti Broodguard
Broodguards were once Humanoids, but they have been transformed by yuan-ti into simpleminded, scaly Monstrosities that do their serpentine masters’ bidding. The transformation process warps not only a subject’s body but also their mind, making them instinctively obey any yuan-ti and filling them with a seething rage at the sight of non-reptilian creatures.

Although broodguards can no longer think as clearly as before their transformation, they are able to perform simple yet important tasks in the community, such as guarding eggs or patrolling for intruders. Yuan-ti refer to broodguards as “histachii,” which means “egg-watchers.”

Most broodguards are made from human captives forced to consume a magical brew that renders them helpless and unable to fight off the inevitable transformation. A human transformed into a broodguard loses all semblance of who they once were. A broodguard is hairless and emaciated, with scaly skin. They have a forked tongue, and they smell faintly of rotting meat. Broodguards can speak but rarely do so, preferring to communicate via snakelike hisses and guttural noises.

Making a Broodguard
Yuan-ti create broodguards from captured Humanoids. Each subject is fed a special potion that immediately renders it incapacitated and transforms it into a broodguard over the next 1d6 + 6 days. A subject forced to imbibe the brew can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw; on a success, it takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is otherwise unaffected.

A spell such as lesser restoration or remove curse can end the transformation process at any time before it runs its course. After the process is complete, only a wish spell can reverse the effect.

Yuan-ti Mind Whisperer
Mind whisperers are yuan-ti malison spellcasters who enter into a pact with the serpent god Sseth, the Sibilant Death. They use their abilities to convert others to their faith, increase their personal power, and befuddle the minds of their enemies.

Mind whisperers are elusive, manipulative, unpredictable, and willing to cheat or kill comrades and rivals alike if doing so benefits them. The worshipers of Sseth have their hands in many schemes, often plying the middle ground between two factions, and thus spend a lot of energy making sure none of their allies learn of their conflicting connections. Even among Sseth-worshiping communities, mind whisperers are known for being self-important, sneaky, and prone to flee at the first sign of trouble.

Yuan-ti Nightmare Speaker
Nightmare speakers are yuan-ti malison priests who make a pact with the Dendar the Night Serpent to feed their deity the fears and nightmares of their victims in exchange for power in the mortal world. These priests receive nightmarish visions from Dendar that they interpret as prophecies, and they then use their magic and influence to make these visions come true.

Nightmare speakers revel in torturing others, keeping their victims in a constant state of fear and dread. They prefer to terrify rather than kill their opponents. They manipulate communities for the purpose of acquiring more victims and enjoy the company of Undead.

The target must make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage and is frightened of the manifestation, believing it to be real. The yuan-ti must concentrate to maintain the illusion (as if concentrating on a spell), which lasts for up to 1 minute and can’t be harmed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the illusion on a success or taking 11 (2d10) psychic damage on a failure.

Yuan-ti Pit Master
With snakes for arms, pit masters are yuan-ti malison priests who have made a pact with the god Merrshaulk and seek to rouse him from his slumber by sacrificing Humanoids to him. They are the most traditionalist yuan-ti and believe that they are best equipped to achieve the goals of their people.

Pit masters are deeply involved in yuan-ti’s long-term plan to take over Humanoid governments, as well as in the ongoing effort to protect their cities from discovery or attacks by hostiles. They oppose reckless behavior and argue for a slow, cautious approach in all matters.

YUAN-TI TEMPLE
VIEW PLAYER VERSION
Monsters: Z
Zaratan
When a zaratan is summoned from the Elemental Plane of Earth, the ground rises up to take the shape of a hulking, armored reptile. A zaratan’s steps trigger shock waves severe enough to level structures. It expresses its rage through trumpeting calls and the occasional boulder or blast of debris it spews from its cavernous maw. If seriously injured, a zaratan retracts its appendages to gain shelter beneath its impervious shell, biding its time until it recovers and can resume its march.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the zaratan fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Siege Monster. The elemental deals double damage to objects and structures (included in Earth-Shaking Movement).

Actions

Multiattack. The zaratan makes one Bite attack and one Stomp attack.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d8 + 10) force damage.

Stomp. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (3d10 + 10) thunder damage.

Spit Rock. Ranged Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, range 120 ft./240 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (6d8 + 10) force damage.

Spew Debris (Recharge 5–6). The zaratan exhales rocky debris in a 90-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the save by 5 or more is knocked prone.

Bonus Actions

Earth-Shaking Movement. After moving at least 10 feet on the ground, the zaratan sends a shock wave through the ground in a 120-foot-radius circle centered on itself. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or the creature’s concentration is broken.

The shock wave deals 100 thunder damage to all structures in contact with the ground in the area. If a creature is near a structure that collapses, the creature might be buried; a creature within half the distance of the structure’s height must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is restrained, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check. If three creatures use their actions in this way, the check is an automatic success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become trapped.

Legendary Actions

The zaratan can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The zaratan regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Stomp. The zaratan makes one Stomp attack.

Move. The zaratan moves up to its speed.

Spit (Costs 2 Actions). The zaratan makes one Spit Rock attack.

Retract (Costs 2 Actions). The zaratan retracts into its shell. Until it takes its Emerge action, it has resistance to all damage, and it is restrained. The next time it takes a legendary action, it must take its Revitalize or Emerge action.

Revitalize (Costs 2 Actions). The zaratan can use this option only if it is retracted in its shell. It regains 52 (5d20) hit points. The next time it takes a legendary action, it must take its Emerge action.

Emerge (Costs 2 Actions). The zaratan emerges from its shell and makes one Spit Rock attack. It can use this option only if it is retracted in its shell.


Zariel
Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, Zariel succumbed to the corrupting influence of the Nine Hells and fell from grace. Asmodeus admired Zariel’s passion for war and offered her rulership of Avernus. She accepted his offer, and he transformed her into an archdevil.

Zariel’s rise in status came at the expense of Bel, her pit fiend predecessor. Zariel and Bel hate each other. To keep Bel busy and out of her sight, Zariel tasks him with forging weapons, armor, and gruesome demon-slaying machines.

To replenish her legions, Zariel needs the souls of mortals to create lemures, which she can then promote to higher forms of devils. She is keenly interested in collecting souls from the greatest warriors on the Material Plane. She bargains hard, and there is little hope of wriggling out of a pact. However, she expects the best from her servants, so she allows her mortal followers to live out their lives provided they continue to hone their talents to increase their value. As a result, Zariel’s servants are universally effective, disciplined, and dangerous.

Actions

Multiattack. Zariel makes three Flail or Longsword attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Horrid Touch, if available.

Flail. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) force damage plus 36 (8d8) fire damage.

Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) radiant damage, or 19 (2d10 + 8) radiant damage when used with two hands, plus 36 (8d8) fire damage.

Horrid Touch (Recharge 5–6). Zariel touches one creature within 10 feet of her. The target must succeed on a DC 26 Constitution saving throw or take 44 (8d10) necrotic damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target is blinded and deafened. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Spellcasting. Zariel casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 26):

At will: alter self (can become Medium when changing her appearance), detect evil and good, fireball, invisibility (self only), major image, wall of fire

3/day each: blade barrier, dispel evil and good, finger of death

Teleport. Zariel teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.

Legendary Actions

Zariel can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Zariel regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

Teleport. Zariel uses Teleport.

Immolating Gaze (Costs 2 Actions). Zariel turns her magical gaze toward one creature she can see within 120 feet of her and commands it to burn. The target must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (4d10) fire damage.


Zariel’s Lair
Zariel makes her lair in a basalt citadel that rises up in Avernus. From nearly a mile away, one can hear the screams coming from burned victims chained to the stronghold’s wall—the dying remains of those who failed to impress the archdevil. The stronghold, covering five square miles, is surrounded by walls reinforced with high turrets. Devils of all kinds crawl over the structure, ensuring that no intruders breach their defenses.

Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zariel can take one of the following lair actions; she can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

Fireball. Zariel casts the fireball spell.

Infernal Illusions. Zariel casts the major image spell four times, targeting different areas with it. Zariel prefers to create images of intruders’ loved ones being burned alive. Zariel doesn’t need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round. Each creature that can see these illusions must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the illusion for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Regional Effects
The region containing Zariel’s lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

Hellscape. The area within 9 miles of the lair is filled with screaming voices and the stench of burning meat.

Pyres. Once every 60 feet within 1 mile of the lair, 10-foot-high gouts of flame rise from the ground. Any creature or object that touches the flame takes 7 (2d6) fire damage, though it can take this damage no more than once per round.

Smoke. The area within 2 miles of the lair, but no closer than 500 feet, is filled with smoke, which causes the area to be heavily obscured. The smoke can’t be cleared away.

If Zariel dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

Cultists of Zariel
Zariel grants special abilities to her most loyal cultists. They can gain the Ferocious Surge trait, and her cult’s leaders can also gain the Infernal Tactics trait.

Ferocious Surge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). When this creature hits with an attack roll that isn’t a critical hit, it can turn the hit into a critical hit.

Infernal Tactics. Immediately after rolling initiative, this creature can choose itself and up to three allies it can see if it isn’t incapacitated. It can swap the initiative results of the chosen creatures among them.

That which falls from grace may yet rise to regain it. If Zariel were to return to her celestial self, how glorious would be the tales!

Zuggtmoy

The Demon Queen of Fungi, Lady of Rot and Decay, Zuggtmoy is an alien creature whose only desire is to infect the living with spores, transforming them into her mindless servants and, eventually, into decomposing hosts for the mushrooms, molds, and other fungi that she spawns.

Zuggtmoy is utterly inhuman, but she can mold her fungoid form into an approximation of a bipedal shape, including the skeletal-thin figure depicted in grimoires and ancient art, draped and veiled in mycelia and lichen. Indeed, much of her appearance and manner, and that of her servants, is a mockery of mortal life and its many facets.

Zuggtmoy’s cultists often follow her unwittingly. Most are fungus-infected to some degree, whether through inhaling her mind-controlling spores or being transformed to the point where flesh and fungus become one. Such cultists are fungal extensions of the Demon Queen’s will. Their devotion might begin with the seemingly harmless promises offered by exotic spores and mushrooms, but it quickly consumes them, body and soul.

Magic Resistance. Zuggtmoy has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

Multiattack. Zuggtmoy makes three Pseudopod attacks.

Pseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) force damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.

Spellcasting. Zuggtmoy casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 22):

At will: detect magic, locate animals or plants

3/day each: dispel magic, entangle, plant growth

1/day each: etherealness, teleport

Bonus Actions

Infestation Spores (3/Day). Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute. Any creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can’t be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy, which lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can’t be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature’s body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it’s a type of creature that can be (see the “Myconids” section in the Monster Manual).

Mind Control Spores (Recharge 5–6). Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute. Humanoids and Beasts in the cloud when it appears, or that enter it later, must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, a creature can’t be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the influence of Zuggtmoy for 24 hours. While infected in this way, the creature is charmed by her and can’t be reinfected by these spores.

Reactions

Protective Thrall. When Zuggtmoy is hit by an attack roll, one creature within 10 feet of her that is charmed by her is hit by the attack instead.

Legendary Actions

Zuggtmoy can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Zuggtmoy regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

Attack. Zuggtmoy makes one Pseudopod attack.

Exert Will. One creature charmed by Zuggtmoy that she can see must use its reaction, if available, to move up to its speed as she directs or to make one weapon attack against a target that she designates.

Zuggtmoy’s Lair
Zuggtmoy’s principal lair is her palace on Shedaklah. It consists of two dozen immense mushrooms of pale yellow and rancid brown. These massive fungi are some of the largest in existence. They are surrounded by a field of acidic puffballs and poisonous vapors. The mushrooms are interconnected by bridges of shelf fungus, and countless chambers have been hollowed out inside their rubbery stalks.

Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zuggtmoy can take one of the following lair actions; she can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

Rally Plants. Up to four Plant creatures that are friendly to Zuggtmoy and that Zuggtmoy can see can use their reactions to move up to their speed and make one weapon attack.

Summon Fungi. Zuggtmoy causes four gas spores or violet fungi (both appear in the Monster Manual) to appear in unoccupied spaces that she chooses within the lair. They vanish after 1 hour.

Unleash Spores. Zuggtmoy uses either her Infestation Spores or her Mind Control Spores, centered on a mushroom or other fungus within her lair, instead of on herself.

Regional Effects
The region containing Zuggtmoy’s lair is warped by her magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

Corrupted Nature. Within 6 miles of the lair, all Wisdom (Medicine) and Wisdom (Survival) checks have disadvantage.

Fungal Infestation. Molds and fungi grow on surfaces within 6 miles of the lair, even where they would normally find no purchase.

Mutating Vegetation. Vegetation within 1 mile of the lair becomes infested with parasitic fungi, slowly mutating as it is overwhelmed.

If Zuggtmoy dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

Cultists of Zuggtmoy
Zuggtmoy’s cultists are primarily mindless victims of her children’s strange spores. The spores burrow into a victim’s brain, turning it into a fanatic servitor. Each victim gains the Spore Kissed trait.

Spore Kissed. This creature is immune to the charmed and frightened conditions. In addition, if it is reduced to 0 hit points, each creature within 10 feet of it takes poison damage equal to its number of Hit Dice.
