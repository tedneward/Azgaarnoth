# Creature: Steel Dragon
Steel dragons are the most stubborn of metallic dragons, similar to bulls in both shape and mentality.

A steel dragon also enjoys the company of other steel dragons, and a place known to be used by steel dragons as a gathering place is avoided by locals, as steel dragons don't take kindly to the thought of being spied on, and devour any creatures they think to be spies. Conversely, a steel dragon often sends its agents to learn about current affairs, and so that it knows when and where evil creatures are lurking, so it can destroy them.

## Diet

## Lairs
A steel dragon lairs in a sun-scorched desert, though it might choose to inhabit a searing savannah.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
Acid erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary steel dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

* Rain is common within 6 miles of the lair.
* Clouds within 6 miles of the lair are steely grey in colour and move to conceal the dragon while it flies.
* Desert creatures within 6 miles of the lair that have an Intelligence score of 5 or lower are charmed by the dragon.

If the dragon dies, the rain fades over the course of 1d10 days, but the other effects end immediately.

## Tactics

## Favored Treasure
A steel dragon's favoured treasures are hard substances, such as metals, ores, and gems. A steel dragon keeps its treasures in a vault within a large stone formation or expansive ruin inside its territory, using that same structure as a den in which it retreats to to avoid the worst of the sun.

## Physical Characteristics
Steel dragons are among the largest of dragons. Two horns, like those of a bull, emerge from the back of its stocky head. A newly hatched steel dragon has somewhat dull silver scales, and as it ages, a steel dragon's scales grow thicker, tougher and brighter in hue. A steel dragon's pupils fade as it ages, and the eyes of the oldest steel dragons resemble glowing blue orbs.

A steel dragon has acidic breath, though it tends to first use its deafening gas to disorient its opponents. A steel dragon's will is as sturdy as its body, and creatures that attempt to threaten a steel dragon rarely leave the dragon's presence alive.
