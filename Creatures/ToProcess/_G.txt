**Keen Hearing and Sight**. The worg rider has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight.

**One Mind.** The worg rider and its mount act on the same initiative count while mounted.

**Nimble Escape.** The worg rider can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns, and do so for both itself and its mount.

**Mobile.** Goblin Worg Riders are particularly speedy and agile. While mounted, they gain the following benefits:

* When they use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn't cost them extra movement on that turn.
* When they make a melee attack against a creature, they don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn, whether they hit or not. (Worg Riders will instinctively and deliberately time their move/attack combos to single out a creature, attack, and nip away before a return attack can come.)

#### Actions
**Multiattack.** The worg rider makes two melee attacks or two ranged attacks.

**Scimitar.** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

**Shortbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. Worg riders can fire while mounted without penalty.

#### Description
Those goblins who are selected to ride the powerful goblinoid-wolves known as [Worgs](Worg.md) are tougher, faster, and meaner than their on-foot cousins. Worg Riders are feared among the goblins, and many a Worg Rider has gone on to become a Boss in their own right later in life. A Worg Rider bonds with its Worg, and the pair are inseparable for their (admittedly brief) lives.

Some Goblin Worg Riders have learned to ride [Dire Wolves](DireWolf.md) or [Hell Hounds](HellHound.md) instead; those goblins are generally considered insane by their fellows, and live in expectation of an even shorter lifespan.
