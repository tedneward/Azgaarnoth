Nature Speech. The musteval can converse with animals and
monstrosities, even if they don’t share a language.
Magic Resistance. The musteval has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical e ects.
Innate Spellcasting. The musteval’s spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 10). The musteval can innately cast
the following spells, requiring only verbal components:
At will: detect evil and good, disguise self, magic missile
1/day each: cure wounds, invisibility
Actions
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 5 piercing damage.
Rapid Attack. The musteval can attack each creature once
during its movement using this action. Each creature that it
attacks during this movement reduces the musteval’s speed
by 5 feet until the start of its next turn. A single creature can
only be attacked once this way, regardless of if the attack hits
or misses.

> Resembling mice, rats, or ferrets, the rodent-headed musteval is the lowest order of guardinal and one the most recent additions.  Unlike other guardinals, they tend to find packs to travel with, rarely adventuring alone.
