# Gnoll
Gnolls are feral humanoids that attack settlements along the frontiers and borderlands of civilization without warning, slaughtering their victims and devouring their flesh.

**Demonic Origin.** The origin of the gnolls traces back to a time when the demon lord Yeenoghu found his way to the Material Plane and ran amok. Packs of ordinary hyenas followed in his wake, scavenging the demon lord’s kills. Those hyenas were transformed into the first gnolls, parading after Yeenoghu until he was banished back to the Abyss. The gnolls then scattered across the face of the world, a dire reminder of demonic power.

**Nomadic Destroyers.** Gnolls are dangerous because they strike at random. They emerge from the wilderness, plunder and slaughter, then move elsewhere. They attack like a plague of locusts, pillaging settlements and leaving little behind but razed buildings, gnawed corpses, and befouled land. Gnolls choose easy targets for their raids. Armored warriors holed up in a fortified castle will survive a rampaging gnoll horde unscathed, even as the towns, villages, and farms that surround the castle are ablaze, their people slaughtered and devoured.

**Hordish Background.** Gnoll packs were a large part of the Hordes that battled against the Eldar from the earliest days of Azgaarnoth's history; since that time, most have continued their tribal, nomadic ways, generally moving southward and now making up a significant percentage of the Ulmhorde. Some tribes chose to seek a more permanent existence within the more "civilized" Hordes, and many gnolls found themselves finding peace within Yithi and Zhi. Other tribes keep to their nomadic background but seek less to pillage and more to trade. Those gnolls who have "civilized" tend to worship any of the other gods *except* Yeenoghu.

Gnolls rarely build permanent structures or craft anything of lasting value. They don’t make weapons or armor, but scavenge such items from the corpses of their fallen victims, stringing ears, teeth, scalps, and other trophies from their foes onto their patchwork armor. Some gnolls will move into cities, but often their personal hygiene habits clash with those of a city, and as a result most will reside either just outside the city walls in tents or huts, or in the worst parts of town. In fact, more than once a gnoll tribe has moved into the slums of a large city and essentially traded the plunder-and-slaughter of wilderness life for the muted-but-more-rewarding lesser-levels-of-plunder-and-slaughter they can get away with in the Slums. However, should two gnoll tribes encouter each other in the same slums district, they will immediately break out into open conflict until one tribe has defeated and absorbed the other.

**Thirst for Blood.** Among the "traditional" gnolls, no goodness or compassion resides in the heart of a gnoll. Like a demon, it lacks anything resembling a conscience, and can’t be taught or coerced to put aside its destructive tendencies. The gnolls’ frenzied bloodlust makes them an enemy to all, and when they lack a common foe, they fight among themselves. Even the most savage orcs avoid allying with gnolls.

However, within the last millenium, tribes of gnolls have begun to change their ways, leaving some to wonder if the influence Yeenoghu exerted upon them has begun to wane. While exceptions exist, most gnolls continue to show their traditional ways, and when coming upon a gnoll in the wild, travelers are strongly suggested to keep weapons close at hand. Gnolls can be a [playable race](/Races/Gnoll.md).

## Monstrous Gnoll Feats
For those gnolls which are favored by Yeenoghu enough to survive to the appropriate levels, a number of gnoll-specific [feats](/Classes/Feats.md) are available.

### Description
Unsure of their abilities, but eager to prove their worth to the pack, the gnoll whelp can be a surprisingly menacing foe. They often run in small packs of whelplings seeking trouble, mischief and food.

Generally the whelps are skittish and will not attack quarry that seems stronger than themselves, but they are not above harrying prey at a distance with missile weapons and closing after softening up their adversaries. It is also worth noting that there is often an angry gnoll clutch mother within short distance.

### Description
Gnolls often worship demon lords
and other foul, chaotic and dark
gods. Such zealous devotion to
abstractions of pure evil is
enough to savagely destroy the
psyche of most mortals, let alone
the bestial minds of the gnolls.
The crazed howlers are those gnolls who give
themselves unto the madness with wicked glee.
They do not see madness, they see ascendance and
devotion to their gods. Gods who will reward
them for death, be it theirs or another’s.
Such gnolls are noted for their maddened, red
bloodshot eyes and mouths agape, panting
incessantly all the while drooling infectious saliva,
whilst wailing to higher powers

### Description
If legends are to be believed,
there are tribes of stunted, pygmy
gnolls deep within the wilds, far
away from the lands of men.
These “miniature” gnolls are
twice as vicious as their cousins,
capable of terrible savagery and
even cannibalism of their own kin. They ritually file
their teeth in an effort to appear more fearsome and
inflict wicked bleeding bites.
The so-called “pygmy” gnoll is much shorter,
standing scarcely four foot high. These gnolls seem
delicate, but are ferocious and cunning, capable of
expert trap-making and poison use. Their mottled
fur often matches that of the shadowy foliage and
canopies, making them stealthy foes as well.

### Description
Hunger has driven these wiry
gnolls to near madness. They are
thin and emaciated, their ribcages
and other bones clearly showing
under patchy fur. Their eyes are
glazed and they spare no effort to
kill anything that moves for sustenance.
While their relatively weakened physical state might
make them seem less of a threat, these gnolls are
furious fighters, knowing they must kill and eat to
live, or they will surely die. They fight from sheer
desperation to survive, and do so with reckless
abandon.

Rampage. When the gnoll reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the gnoll can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

Actions

Multiattack. The gnoll makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) poison damage.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

### Description
Gnolls celebrate their victories by performing demonic rituals and making blood offerings to Yeenoghu. Sometimes the demon lord rewards his worshipers by allowing one of them to be possessed by a demonic spirit. Marked as Yeenoghu’s favorite, the lucky recipient becomes a fang of Yeenoghu, the chosen of the Gnoll Lord. In much the same way Yeenoghu created the first gnolls, a hyena that feasts on a fang’s slain foe undergoes a horrible transformation, becoming a full-grown adult gnoll. Depending on the number of hyenas in a region, a fang of Yeenoghu can lead to a startling increase in the gnoll population. Finding and killing the fang is the only way to keep that population in check.

## Winter Gnoll
In the southernmost woodlands, mountains and
even in the ice-covered arctic lie
a tribe of gnolls who are said to
have been born of the same
dark rituals as the standard
gnoll, but of winter wolf
mothers.
These arctic gnolls are silvery-white in color and
have a fearsome cold look in their ice-blue eyes.
They are taller and stronger than the typical gangly
gnoll, and travel in efficient packs led by an alpha.

into the space occupied by the trap they take (3)
1d6 slashing damage and halve all land speed
movement and cannot charge or run until making
a successful Strength check DC 11 to remove the
trap.

## Cave Gnoll
The cave gnoll is a horrific brute,
a genetic throwback of the
standard gnoll. They are foultempered
and less intelligent, but
vastly stronger than the typical
gnoll. Sometimes they breed true
enough that entire communities
of cave gnolls are born. Such
creatures kill simply for pleasure and sport and their
caves and surrounding environs are littered with the
bones of those unfortunate enough to cross their
paths.

## Gnoll Mercenaries
Adorned with higher quality arms
and armor, the gnoll mercenary is
one gnoll who has come to terms
with his existence. They love to
fight and kill, and love all the
pleasures money can buy, so it
comes as no surprise some gnolls learn to tolerate
other humanoids, fighting at their command for
gold. Of course, this is only when it is convenient,
and the gnolls feel victory is assured.

## Two-headed Gnoll
A two-headed gnoll is generally
considered an omen of good
luck to its parents, and as it
grows, they are generally
favored and become
considerably stronger and
more arrogant than their
brethren. Few other gnolls
would abuse them, risking the ire of their dark gods.
In war, the two-headed gnoll is a terrifying and
disconcerting foe, able to simultaneously attack
flanking foes. Woe to those who are close enough
to smell its wretched breath, for its jaws are twice
as lethal as well.

## Plague-bearer Gnoll
Generally gnolls are already a
filthy lot. Flies buzz about
them, and they are no strangers
to lice and fleas. But there are
worse things than insects that
can infest gnolls. They have no
qualms with eating carrion and
some even traffic with ghouls. This has led to a
number of gnolls become plague carriers. Some few
gnolls, such as the plague bearer, are so infused with
disease they become walking death.

## Giant-blooded Gnoll
Terrors of the great desert, the
rare abomination of mixed gnoll
and desert giant is a fearsome
beast. They stand some eight feet
tall and their bodies are dense
with muscle and covered in
coppery patched fur. In their
eyes gleam hatred and greed, and surprise when
they meet those not willing to give them what they
desire, which quickly turns to ire...

## Den Mother Gnoll
The den mother is a gnoll who
frequently births litters of pups,
and is incredibly protective of her
young. The den mother generally
is well-fed, stronger and more
mean-spirited than the already
unruly gnolls. When her pups or whelps are in
danger, the den mother becomes a terrifying foe.

## Demon-possessed Gnoll
The demon-possessed gnoll is one
who earned the “favor” of
becoming possessed by a
summoned Nabasu demon.
Usually these gnolls are handpicked
by the shamans or clerics
of a demon lord. They have
served the pack well in combat, and themselves are
already formidable.
Once ritually bound and possessed, the gnoll
becomes an amalgamation of gnoll and demonic
power. Its skin often has blasphemous markings
carved into it, and the gnoll’s eyes glow a dull
inhuman red.

## Warchief
The gnoll warchief is a general of
sorts, at least among gnolls. He or
she is often the eldest warrior,
right next to the chieftain. The
warchief serves as the right hand
man, and advisor of all things war
related. The warchief also leads
incursions of large bands of gnolls into battle.
They are generally large gnolls, well-muscled and
scarred, with high quality weaponry and armor and
an obvious aura of confidence.

## Flind
The flind is a generally superior specimen of gnoll. Some believe they are simply bigger and stronger gnolls, while others think they might be genetic throwbacks. The true origin of the gnolls is often elusive, making the flind even more so.

* To create a flind, simply use the base gnoll stats and add the Advanced Simple Template for a CR 2 version.

 Any of the gnolls in this supplement can be
given the Advanced Simple Template to
become Flind versions (especially the
rageborn!).
