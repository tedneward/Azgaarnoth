> The ram-headed cervidal are said to resemble satyrs,
a statement they’ll outright and fl atly deny. Perhaps
the differences are subtle, but it is more likely that of
all the guardinals, the cervidal have the most pride.
Contrary to their powerful physical build, most
cervidal prefer to avoid confl ict whenever possible
through the use of their magic.
