## Actions
**Multiattack.** The equinal makes four slam attacks

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6+6) bludgeoning damage.

**War Whinny.** The equinal unleashes a terrifying shriek. All creatures of the equinal’s choice within 40 feet, must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become deafened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The equinal gains temporary hit points equal to twice the number of creatures targeted (regardless of the outcome of their saving throw).

> The most reserved of the guardinals, the equinal is a deadly warrior. Able to survive damage that would end lesser creatures, they spend most of their lives perfecting a specific art, honing it in the same way they would their martial prowess. Warrior poets, artists, and songwriters are common ways of life for an equinal.
