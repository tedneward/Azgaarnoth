***Might of the Master***. The following numbers increase by 1 when your proficiency bonus increases by 1: the iron defender’s skill bonuses, the bonuses to hit and damage of its bite, and the number of hit points restored by its Repair action.

***Vigilant***. The iron defender can’t be surprised.

#### Actions 
*(Requires the [Battle Smith](/Classes/Artificer/BattleSmith.md)'s bonus action)*

**Bite**. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target you can see. Hit: 1d8 + 2 piercing damage.
**Repair (3/Day)**. The magical mechanisms inside the iron defender restore 2d8 + 2 hit points to itself or to one construct or object within 5 feet of it.

## Reaction
**Defensive Pounce**. The iron defender imposes disadvantage on the attack roll of one creature it can see that is within 5 feet of it, provided the attack roll is against a creature other than the iron defender.
