Sea horses are common to the waters around Azgaarnoth, and "flocks" of both normal- and giant-sized sea horses can often be spotted from ships as they pass through the [Deepwaters](../Geography/Deepwaters.md).

## Giant Sea Horse
Like their smaller kin, giant sea horses are shy, colorful fish with elongated bodies and curled tails. Sea elves and tritons often train them as mounts, particularly for aquatic paladins.
