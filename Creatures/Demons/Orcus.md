## Orcus
Orcus is the Demon Prince of Undeath, also known as the Blood Lord. While he takes pleasure in the sufferings of the living, he far prefers the company and service of Undead. His desire is to see all life quenched and the multiverse transformed into a vast necropolis populated solely by Undead creatures under his command.

Orcus rewards those who spread death in his name by granting them a small portion of his power. The least of these become ghouls and zombies (both appear in the Monster Manual) that serve in his legions, while his favored servants are the cultists and necromancers who murder the living and then manipulate the dead, emulating their dread master.

Orcus is a bestial creature of corruption with a diseased, decaying look. He has the lower torso of a goat and a humanlike upper body with a belly swollen with rot. Great bat wings sprout from his shoulders, and his head is like the skull of a goat, the flesh nearly rotted from it. In one hand, he wields the legendary Wand of Orcus, which is described in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

### Cultists of Orcus

Orcus grants his rank-and-file cultists the Undying Soul trait, and his cult leaders can gain the Aura of Death trait.

***Undying Soul (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If this creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it immediately makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, it is instead reduced to 1 hit point.

***Aura of Death.*** This creature emanates a deathly aura that extends 30 feet in every direction from its space while it isn't incapacitated. The aura is blocked by total cover. While in the aura, the creature and any friendly Undead are immune to the frightened condition and have resistance to radiant damage. Enemies have disadvantage on death saving throws while in the aura.

Creatures in that area have vulnerability to necrotic damage.

### A Orcus's Lair
Orcus makes his lair in the fortress city of Naratyr, which is on Thanatos, the layer of the Abyss that he rules. Surrounded by a moat fed by the River Styx, Naratyr is an eerily quiet and cold city, its streets empty for hours at a time. The central castle of bone has interior walls of flesh and carpets made of woven hair. The city contains wandering Undead, many of which are engaged in continuous battles with one another.

#### Lair Actions

* On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Orcus can take one of the following lair actions; he can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

* Deadly Utterance. Orcus's voice booms throughout the lair. His utterance causes one creature of his choice to be subjected to power word kill. Orcus needn't see the creature, but he must be aware that the individual is in the lair.

* Grasp of the Dead. Orcus causes skeletal arms to rise from an area on the ground in a 20-foot square that he can see. They last until the next initiative count 20. Each creature in that area when the arms appear must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be restrained until the arms disappear or until Orcus releases them (no action required).

* Undead Servants. Orcus causes up to six corpses within the lair to rise as skeletons, zombies, or ghouls (all appear in the Monster Manual). These Undead obey his telepathic commands, which can reach anywhere in the lair.


#### Regional Effects
* The region containing Orcus's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

* Charnel Realm. The air is filled with the stench of rotting flesh, and buzzing flies grow thick within the region.

* Undead Beasts. Dead Beasts periodically animate as Undead mockeries of their former selves. Skeletal and zombie versions of local wildlife are commonly seen in the area.

* If Orcus dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.
