## Shadow Demon
When a demon's body is destroyed but the fiend is prevented from reforming in the Abyss, its essence sometimes takes on a vague physical form. These shadow demons exist outside the normal abyssal hierarchy, since their creation results most often from mortal magic, not from transformation or promotion.

Shadow demons all but disappear in the darkness, and they can creep about without making a sound. A shadow demon uses its insubstantial claws to feast on its victim's fears, to taste its memories, and drink in its doubts. Bright light harries this fiend and shows its distinct shape, resolving it from a blur of darkness to a winged humanoid creature whose lower body trails off into nothing, and whose claws rend a victim's mind.

***Shadowy Nature.*** A shadow demon doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
