## Molydeus
The fearsome molydeus speaks for the demon lord it serves and enforces its master's will. This demon is 12 feet tall, and its bipedal body has a slavering wolf's head and a fanged serpent's head. Its demon lord can speak and see through the serpent head; this master also uses the molydeus to guard treasures, slay foes, and terrify troops into obedience.

A molydeus's demon lord bestows on it a powerful weapon that dissolves if the molydeus dies. The weapon's form varies depending on the creator, but that doesn't affect the weapon's capabilities.

>#### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The molydeus makes one Demonic Weapon attack, one Snakebite attack, and one Wolf Bite attack.
>
>***Demonic Weapon.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (4d12 + 9) force damage. If the target has at least one head and the molydeus rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it can't survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge or larger. Such a creature takes an extra 27 (6d8) force damage from the hit.
>
>***Snakebite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target transforms into a manes (see the Monster Manual) if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This transformation can be ended only by a wish spell.

A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the molydeus, acts as an ally of the molydeus, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or the molydeus dies, or until the molydeus dismisses it as an action.
