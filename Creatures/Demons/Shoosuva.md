## Shoosuva
A shoosuva is a hyena-demon gifted by Yeenoghu (appears in this book) to an especially powerful worshiper (typically a fang of Yeenoghu; see the Monster Manual). A shoosuva manifests shortly after a Yeenoghu-worshiping war band achieves a great victory, emerging from a billowing, fetid cloud of smoke as it arrives from the Abyss. In battle, the demon wraps its slavering jaws around one victim while lashing out with the poisonous stinger on its tail to bring down another. A creature immobilized by the poison becomes easy pickings for any nearby members of the war band.

Each shoosuva is bonded to a particular worshiper of Yeenoghu and fights alongside its master. A gnoll that has been gifted with a shoosuva is second only to a flind (appears in this book) in status within a war band dedicated to Yeenoghu.
