## Baphomet
Civilization is weakness and brutality is strength in the credo of Baphomet, the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts. He is worshiped by those who want to break the confines of civility and unleash their bestial natures, for Baphomet envisions a world without restraint, where creatures live out their most bloodthirsty desires.

Cults devoted to Baphomet use mazes and complex knots as their emblems. They create secret places to indulge themselves, including labyrinths of the sort their master favors. Bloodstained crowns and weapons of iron and brass decorate their profane altars.

Over time, a cultist of Baphomet becomes tainted by his influence, gaining bloodshot eyes and coarse, thickening hair. Small horns eventually sprout from the cultist's forehead. In time, a devoted cultist might transform entirely into a minotaur, which is considered the greatest gift of the Prince of Beasts.

Baphomet appears as a fearsome, 20-foot-tall minotaur with six iron horns. A fiendish light burns in his red eyes. Although he is filled with bestial blood lust, there lies within him a cruel and cunning intellect devoted to subverting all civilization.

Baphomet wields a great glaive called Heartcleaver. He also charges his enemies and gores them with his horns, trampling his foes into the earth and rending them with his teeth like a beast.

### Cultists of Baphomet
Baphomet grants his cultists special abilities. All his devotees gain the Labyrinthine Recall trait below. He grants his rank-and-file followers the Unerring Tracker trait, and cult leaders gain the Incite the Hunters trait.

***Labyrinthine Recall.*** This creature can perfectly recall any path it has traveled.

***Unerring Tracker.*** As a bonus action, this creature magically creates a psychic link with one creature it can see. For the next hour, as a bonus action this creature learns the current distance and direction to the target if it is on the same plane of existence. The link ends if this creature is incapacitated or if it uses this ability on a different target.

***Incite the Hunters (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** As an action, this creature allows each ally within 30 feet of it that has the Unerring Tracker trait to make one weapon attack as a reaction against the target of that ally's Unerring Tracker.

### Baphomet's Lair
Baphomet's lair is his palace, the Lyktion, which is on the layer of the Abyss called the Endless Maze. Nestled within the twisting passages of the plane-wide labyrinth, the Lyktion is immaculately maintained and surrounded by a moat constructed in the fashion of a three-dimensional maze. The palace is a towering structure whose interior is as labyrinthine as the plane on which it stands; it is populated by minotaurs, goristros, and quasits, all of which appear in the Monster Manual.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Baphomet can take one of the following lair actions; he can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:
* Illusory Room. Baphomet casts mirage arcane, affecting a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. The effect ends on the next initiative count 20. Charisma is Baphomet's spellcasting ability for this spell.
* Reverse Gravity. Baphomet chooses a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. Until the next initiative count 20, gravity is reversed within that room. Any creatures or objects in the room when this happens fall in the direction of the new pull of gravity, unless they have some means of remaining aloft. Baphomet can ignore the gravity reversal if he's in the room, although he likes to use this action to land on a ceiling to attack targets flying near it.
* Seal the Way. Baphomet seals one doorway or other entryway within the lair. The opening must be unoccupied. It is filled with solid stone for 1 minute or until Baphomet takes this lair action again.
#### Regional Effects
The region containing Baphomet's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:
* Beguiling Realm. Within 6 miles of the lair, all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Performance) checks have disadvantage, and all Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks have advantage.
* Hedge Mazes. Plant life within 1 mile of the lair grows thick and forms walls of trees, hedges, and other flora in the form of small mazes.
* Panicked Beasts. Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become frightened and disoriented, as though constantly under threat of being hunted, and might lash out or panic even when no visible threat is nearby.
* If Baphomet dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.
