## Giant Spider
To snare its prey, a giant spider spins elaborate webs or shoots sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Giant spiders are most commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark, web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims.

## Giant Wolf Spider
Smaller than a giant spider, a giant wolf spider hunts prey across open ground or hides in a burrow or crevice, or in a hidden cavity beneath debris. They can be found almost anywhere in Azgaarnoth, though they particularly enjoy the crevices of the many ruins that litter the landscape. They can be particularly dangerous (and are quite numerous) in [Chidia](../Geography/Chidia.md), as half the continent is broken and rocky ground, and the other half city ruins. Legend says they are also quite plentiful in the [Underdark](../Geography/Underdark.md), so much so that the dwarves have legends of a spider goddess that seeks to prey on unwary dwarves who venture too far out from the hearth of the clan.
