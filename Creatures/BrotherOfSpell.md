**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the brother to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the brother drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Siphon Soul.** The Brothers of Steel are able to siphon the souls of others and use them as energy sources. If the Brother is able to make a successful Claw attack, it can attempt to siphon the soul of its target. The target must make a Wisdom (DC 15) save, or suffer 1d3 temporary Wisdom damage. The Brother then gains six times the suffered damage in temporary hit points, possibly exceeding its hit point maximum. Any creature reduced to 0 Wisdom falls unconscious. Alternatively, it can restore 1 level of spell slot per point of Wisdom damage.
