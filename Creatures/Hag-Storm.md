Portent from Weather. At the start of each day, the hag
peers into the sky or the ocean for at least 1 minute,
then the DM rolls three d20s and records the numbers

creature that she can see with one of these foretelling
rolls before the roll is made.

is Charisma (spell save DC 16). She can innately cast

that she has trapped or bottled:
At will: call lightning, disguise self, druidcraft, feather
fall, fly (self only), gaseous form, gust of wind
3/day each: control water, fog cloud (as 5th-level),

## Description
Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.

**Faces of Evil.** Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair, horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch. Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.

All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity.

Hags name themselves in darkly whimsical ways, claiming monikers such as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug, Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.

**Monstrous Motherhood.** Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother’s womb, the hag consumes the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.

Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.

**Dark Bargains.** Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.

Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something dear — especially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge gained through the bargain.

**A Foul Nature.** Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, suppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might “help” such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.

This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects of a hag’s life. A hag might fly in a magical giant’s skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.

**Dark Sorority.** Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag in existence. Hags don’t like each other, but they abide by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into another hag’s territory, bring gifts when entering another hag’s dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags — as long as the oath isn’t given with the fingers crossed.

Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags’ rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before teaching it a permanent lesson.

**Dark Lairs.** Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag’s lair reflects the creature’s noxiousness, such that the land itself can attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby, while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers.

A storm hag spends most of her time watching the weather and planning. She appears at first as a shrunken elderly woman with wiry and scattered hair that often looks like a gray thundercloud, and she greets visitors warmly. Yet behind this congenial mask they present for first impressions, these hags are just as malicious as any other.

Storm hags take sadistic joy in making bargains, contracts, and deals that turn unexpectedly against their victims and ruin their lives - more than any other kind of hag. These hags always prefer to use such a bargain when inflicting suffering, and find the chaotic nature of other hags to be distasteful at best. Their true forms have bone-white skin that is covered in twisted electrical scars, but they reveal these forms only right before they finally consume a hapless and ruined victim.

**Weather Diviners.** The sky and the movement of clouds - or the currents of the ocean - are like a swirling map of the future to the eldritch eyes of a storm hag. They use these weather auguries to inform their decisions when making their dark bargains, as well as using the information as bargaining chips directly. Storm hags are so renowned for their divinations that blue dragons, storm giants, djinni, and even aboleths come looking to trade for what they know.

**Bottling a Storm.** Storm hags gain their name not only from their innate affinity for storms, but also from their practice of capturing pieces of storm clouds. These hags venture into thunderstorms armed with special magic bottles that they use to siphon a chunk of the cloud's primal magic, sealing the bottle to contain it. They use these bottled storms to focus their magic, to observe in lieu of real storms, or even to unleash as a measure of self-defense. Adventurers who slay a storm hag often make use of the bottled storms she has lining the shelves inside of her lair.

Some storm hags can animate small clouds to sit and ride upon to fly through the sky without effort. Such a cloud acts as a carpet of flying that can be contained or released from a bottle by speaking its command word Capricious Wrath. While storm hags excel at hiding their wicked nature behind a mask of friendly warmth, their true emotions are always swirling underneath the surface, ready to be unleashed at a moment's notice. The wrong move or word can take a storm hag from dignified friendliness into a tempestuous rage. Should you manage to outsmart them in one of their dark bargains, you may find the storm hag's rage to be neverending, and legends say her wrath may persist in some eldritch form even after her death ...

**Covens.** A storm hag that is part of a [coven](Hag-Covens.md) has a challenge rating of 12 (8,400 XP).
