**Sand Form.** The sand assassin can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In addition, the sand assassin can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. A creature that ends its turn inside the sand assassin's space must also make the saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature is blinded for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the blindness on a success.

**Dispersal.** As a bonus action, the sand assassin can disperse or end its dispersal. While dispersed, the sand assassin is Gargantuan, its space is lightly obscured, enemies have disadvantage on attack rolls against it, and it is indistinguishable from a cloud of dust, but it cannot make attacks and it automatically fails all Strength saving throws and ability checks.

**Glass.** If the sand assassin takes more than 15 fire damage at once, it partially glasses; its speed is reduced by 5 feet for 1 minute.

**Undetectable in Sandstorms.** While the sand assassin is heavily obscured by sand or dust, it is invisible and it can't be sensed by blindsight or tremorsense.

#### Actions
**Multiattack.** The sand assassin makes two Sand Claw attacks.

**Sand Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) slashing damage. If the target does not have any allies within 5 feet of it, the sand swirls around it and the attack deals 9 (2d8) bonus slashing damage.

## Description
The elemental planes of water, earth, fire, and air align on planar borders where two elements combine to form a new dual-element, such as earth and air creating sand. These border zones give rise to new hybrid elementals made of the combined element.

A sand assassin resembles an athletic human made entirely of sand usually with more sand shaped into cords or rags wrapping around it. With just a bit of dust or sand about, this unusually lawful elemental is easily mistaken from afar for a normal desert traveler, but a good look at its head reveals that it has no face, save for the one hollow eye in its forehead.

Sand assassins are bound to guard a stretch of land for eternity, hunting down and slaying all those who trespass upon their charge. These elementals sometimes come to decide that a particular place is worthy of protection for inscrutable reasons of their own, but usually they are bound by the one who summoned them, often someone long-dead such as a long-forgotten resident of ancient ruins buried in a canyon or stretch of desert that the elemental still guards.

**Loyal Sentinels.** Often the elemental doesn't recall what it was in the location that it required protection, and rarely do they care to remember, either. For the sand assassin, the task is all that matters. Those that are slain by sand assassins are usually mistaken for victims of a sandstorm, and even those lucky few that escape the reaches of the elemental almost never know what it was, hidden beneath the sands, that they were warded away from.

**Ruthless Hunters.** Sand assassins detest being seen by those who have not yet trespassed and prefer to hide from such beings. In combat, this elemental tries to sneak up on its victims, hiding as a dust cloud or among a real sandstorm to approach its targets, then blinding them with its Sand Form trait before attacking them with surprise. It usually prefers to strike those that are alone so it can deal bonus damage. If it is in melee range with a target that isn't alone, the elemental will seek a target in the fight that is more alone, blinding those that threaten opportunity attacks and flying or burrowing to reach its next lonely victim. If its enemies stay grouped together to avoid the bonus damage, the sand assassin attempts to blind many targets at once instead.

**Elemental Nature.** A sand assassin doesn't require air, food drink, or sleep.
