## Wight King
Over the millennnia, many a barrow of an ancient warrior-king has been violated by dark spirits or necromantic magic. The corpses of these once-mighty warriors are given unlife and part of their souls ripped back from eternity to provide an echo of their former minds. The only way to undo this foul sacrilege is to destroy the animated form and release the soul fragment back to eternity. Until this is accomplished, the wight king walks the earth as a powerful and destructive undead warrior.

Wight kings possess the memories and drives of their formerly living selves but polluted to evil and twisted by anguished jealousy against all who still live and breathe. Victims drained of life by the touch of a wight king rise again as normal wights under the wight king's command. Any zombies created by these wights come under the control of the wight king. In this way a wight king can gather himself a considerable army of undead.
