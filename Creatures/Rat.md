***Vectors of Disease.*** Some rats (giant or otherwise) carry vile diseases that they spread with their bites. A diseased rat's challenge rating does not change; a diseased giant rat has a challenge rating of 1/8 (25 XP) both have the following action instead of the normal Bite attack. (Note that the statistics for the Bite do not change other than to add the check for disease.)

> ***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can’t regain hit points except by magical means, and the target’s hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) every 24 hours. If the target’s hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the target dies.

## Giant Rat
If any player at any point during an encounter with a giant rat makes a joke about this being a "rodent of unusual size", the entire party engages in the rest of combat at disadvantage on all die rolls. Rats are *very* sensitive about their weight.
