# Creature: Green Dragon
Green dragons are conniving, deceitful creatures. As an elder green once put it, "Hunting for dinner is no fun. Getting your dinner to offer itself to you? That is fun." Green dragons view all creatures as lesser, and therfore as either prey or pawn; more often than naught, a green dragon will corrupt politicians, whether through threat or bribery, in a neighboring town to gain power by proxy, just for the fun of it. Even so, greens will negotiate to live peacefully with their neighbors, but one should be very wary when entering into any such contract, as nothing makes a green dragon's heart sing with joy more than finding a loophole and exploiting it.

## Diet
Greens prefer sentient mammalians, with a particular taste for elves, but such prey is rare, so they usually subsist on forest life such as deer, bears, and wolves.

## Tactics
Greens are just as comfortable fighting on the ground as they are in the air, likely due to the dense vegetation that limits their flight when hunting. They take cover in trees or behind hills and boulders; the trees prove more of a hindrance to the arrows of humanoids than they do to the poisonous gas of the dragon.

Greens also spend most of their time patrolling their territory, not just looking for intruders, but memorizing the landscape and every possible hiding place and path through the trees.

If given the opportunity, a green dragon will attempt to talk to its foes. They are among the most cunning of dragons, and they are fully aware of the time constraints of spells and other such effects, so they will try to hold a conversation long enough for those effects to wear off. During the course of the conversation, the dragon will attempt to get its foes to lower their guard (of course lying through its teeth the whole time), while leading them into a disadvantageous position (such as grouping them in such a way that a single breath weapon attack would hit them all). Then, when the dragon has them exactly where it wants them, it drops all cordiality and attacks.

## Terrain and Habitat
Green dragons prefer temperate or cold forests to wet jungles or nonforested areas, but they will take the latter in the absence of the former. They particularly love old forests
with large trees.

## Lairs
If they can find one, green dragons prefer caves in forested hills and cliffsides. Some have been known to topple enormous trees into piles and lair inside of these makeshift huts, and still others have set up residence in enormous trees touched by fey magic.

## Favored Treasure
Green dragons love any treasure that required a lot of work to be put into it, such as a large sculpture or a magic sword. They keep coins and gems around as a part of their hoard, which they sometimes use (sparingly, as they hate parting with any bit of their hoard) to bribe or coerce minions into doing things that will ultimately bring them greater wealth, power, or amusement.

Of course, a green dragon's absolute favorite treasure is the creatures that it has under its command.

## Environmental Diffusion
When a Green Dragon undergoes Environmental Diffusion, the area becomes overgrown with dense, enormous, beautiful, and deadly plant life, which can range from bushes and flowers to enormous trees, but all of it is poisonous. These areas are often connected to the Feywild.

## Green Dragon [Feats](DraconicFeats.md)
The following feats can only be taken by green dragons.

### Acrid Dragon
The dragon has resistance to acid damage.

### Command Plants
*Prerequisite: must be Ancient or older.*

The dragon gains the following action option:

**Command Plants (1/Day).** The dragon targets a number of plant creatures within 120 feet of it and whose combined Challenge Rating is less than or equal to the dragon’s. All affected creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (save DC = 8 + the dragon's proficiency bonus + the dragon's Charisma modifier) or be dominated by the dragon as if by a [dominate monster]() spell.

### Dominating Presence
*Prerequisites: must be a spellcaster with at least one charm spell; must be Adult or older.*

When targeting a creature of the dragon’s Challenge Rating or lower, the dragon’s charms ignore resistance to (or advantage on saves against) the charmed condition. In addition, the dragon can use a bonus or legendary action to exert precise control of creatures it has charmed or dominated.

### Forest Dragon
The dragon has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forest environments.

### Inscrutable
Wisdom (Perception or Insight) checks made to ascertain the dragon's intentions or sincerity are made with disadvantage.

### Mind of Steel
*Prerequisite: Inscrutable.*

The dragon has resistance to psychic damage.

### Persistent Poison
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

After the dragon uses its breath weapon, a cloud of gas lingers in the breath weapon's area. A creature that starts its turn there or enters the area for the first time on its turn must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (save DC = Poison Breath save DC), or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The area in the cloud is lightly obscured, and the cloud lasts for 2 (1d4) rounds or until cleared by strong wind.

### Poison Environment
*Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.*

The dragon can, over time, poison the thorns and branches of plants in the area around its lair. Any creature that makes contact with a poisoned plant takes 2 (1d4) poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (save DC = Poison Breath save DC) or be poisoned for 1 hour.

### Poisonous Blood
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

When the dragon has half of its hitpoints remaining or less, if a creature within 5 feet of it hits it with a weapon attack, the attacker takes 10 (3d6) poison damage.

### Potent Poison
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

The dragon's attacks ignore resistance to poison damage. When the dragon rolls poison damage, it can treat any 1 rolled on a damage die as a 2.

### Silver Tongue
*Prerequisite: Smooth Talker; must be Mature Adult or older.*

When the dragon makes any Charisma ability check, the dragon can choose to treat the number it rolled as if it were a 20. The dragon can use this ability only once per day.

### Smooth Talker
The dragon can add double its proficiency bonus to Deception and Persuasion ability checks.
