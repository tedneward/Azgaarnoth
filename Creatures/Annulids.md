# Annulids

Annulids, also known as leech mages for their leech-like bodies and magical abilities, are aberrant creatures from the Far Realm who are respectful, civil, polite and no less evil for it. An annulid's body resembles that of an overgrown leech with two bulbous black eyes and four tentacles like a parody of a human's arms and legs. Annulids always cover their bodies with dark robes, raised hoods and plain masks which cover their mouths, lined with teeth and able to grab tightly to their prey. In battle, annulids remove their masks and lower their hoods, that they might drain blood from their victims more easily, though they also frequently make use of another weapon; the staff, also used as a symbol of status among their kind.

All annulids are also innately capable of teleportation, which they will instinctively use to avoid danger and reach advantageous positions.

***Servants to the Mother.*** Annulids worship an otherworldly entity known as Isuga the Leech Mother, who they believe to be their progenitress and also responsible for the creation of all manner of squirming creatures. Annulid worship of Isuga mainly takes the form of blood sacrifice, as they believe that this is necessary to feed her and that otherwise she would slowly wither and die. Annulids rarely give their own blood, of course, preferring to give the blood of others, usually animals, though they aren't picky and will readily sacrifice mad cultists and prying sorts who delve too deep into their affairs, or those unlucky individuals who do the same. When annulids make a sacrifice, they swarm over their offering and drain it completely of all its blood, as annulid belief states that all blood consumed by annulids goes to Isuga.

When annulids gather, one of their primary objectives is always to gather and then maintain a secret cult of mortals sold on promises of great wealth and good fortune. The annulids always deliver on their promises, though the price in blood grows ever higher with every promise made.

## Annulid Broodling
Annulid broodlings are the most numerous of their kind, so much so that many speak of broodlings as though they were the only annulids to exist. Annulid broodlings use their spells to distract and harry their enemies from afar while hired mercenaries or fanatical cultists engage their foes up close.

Annulid Gargantuan

Annulid gargantuans are truly massive and possess immense strength. Unlike other annulids, gargantuans prefer to be wherever the fighting is most dangerous, gladly risking their own lives to protect their weaker kin and using their teleportation to close the distance between themselves and their enemies.

## Annulid Hierophant

Annulid hierophants lead other annulids in worship of Isuga, wielding powerful divine magic to wreak havoc upon those who would oppose the Leech Mother's will. Whenever hierophants go to battle, they are surrounded by throngs of fawning cultists and their lesser kin, eager to earn the blessings of Isuga by aiding one who has already attained them.

## Annulid Messiah
While all annulids believe themselves to be descended from Isuga, the annulid messiahs are said to be her direct offspring. Blessed with incredible power, all annulids inherently acknowledge messiahs as their leaders and worship them as demigods, living instruments of Isuga's will. With all their gifts, it's hard to deny such stories.

Unlike most other annulids, a messiah neglects the use of a staff, preferring instead to use their own otherworldly magic to torment the minds of their enemies with but a simple touch. Alternatively, a messiah will use a scintillating, constantly squirming orb of maddening psychic power or a lashing whip that glows so brightly it's painful to look at.

### An Annulid Messiah's Lair
Annulid messiahs make their lairs in grandiose temples constructed by their loyal followers, walls lined with eerily beautiful murals that glorify annulids and Isuga. Those who walk past these murals swear that they move when not directly observed and fear that they are somehow linked to the messiah.

While within its lair, the messiah can send dreams to creatures nearby, which it uses to send orders and warnings to its minions and threats to its enemies.

More dangerously, the annulid messiah's alien influence and bond to the Far Realm are so powerful that it can send its enemies directly to that godforsaken place, or even lure the miscreations that call it home into reality, where they act in unusual ways, hinting that the messiah has some measure of control over them. Of course, some of these monsters are merely illusions conjured to mislead those who seek to hunt the annulid.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the annulid takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the annulid can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* The annulid rolls a d8 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.
* A flash of dazzling light briefly illuminates the lair near the annulid. Each creature of the annulid's choice within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 5 (1d10) psychic damage.
* One creature the annulid can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to the Far Realm. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the annulid's. If the creature wins, it escapes the Far Realm. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing an annulid messiah's lair is warped by the annulid's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

* Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the annulid's lair, the annulid can cast the dream spell targeting that creature without expending a spell slot. The annulid can't deal any damage when it casts dream in this way.
* Images of Large or smaller aberrations haunt the land within 1 mile of the annulid's lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.
* Jagged gates appear in the sky within 1 mile of the annulid's lair, forming portals to the Far Realm that allow aberrant creatures into the world to dwell nearby.

If the annulid dies, these effects end immediately.

## Cadaverous Annulid
Annulids are known for their distaste for necromancy and stronger distaste for the undead, but this doesn't stop some among them from studying the dark arts. Those individuals are branded with the title of cadaverous, shunned by their peers and forced to live on the outskirts of annulid society. Cadaverous annulids still work alongside other annulids on occasion, for they still revere Isuga and also still need blood to survive.

## Annulid Lich

Few annulids contemplate the path to lichdom, as doing so means they will be exiled from their people forever, not to mention the fact that only the most powerful of mages can even attempt such a feat to begin with. Those that do are isolated loners, exiled from annulid society and capable of attracting only other exiles. However, so long as a leech mage lich feeds captured souls to its phylactery, it maintains the muscular power of its bite and the ability to attach.
