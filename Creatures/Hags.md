# Hags
Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.

***Faces of Evil.*** Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair, horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch. Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.

All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity.

Hags name themselves in darkly whimsical ways, claiming monikers such as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug, Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.

***Monstrous Motherhood.*** Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother's womb, the hag consumes the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.

Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.

***Dark Bargains.*** Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are pleased to sell.

Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something dear — especially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge gained through the bargain.

***A Foul Nature.*** Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, suppurating flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might "help" such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.

This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects of a hag's life. A hag might fly in a magical giant's skull, landing it on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might travel with a menagerie of monsters kept in cages, and disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.

***Dark Sorority.*** Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag in existence. Hags don't like each other, but they abide by an ageless code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into another hag's territory, bring gifts when entering another hag's dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags — as long as the oath isn't given with the fingers crossed.

Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags' rules of conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before teaching it a permanent lesson.

***Dark Lairs.*** Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag's lair reflects the creature's noxiousness, such that the land itself can attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby, while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary wanderers.

***Hag Covens.*** When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.

A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.

***Shared Spellcasting.*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:

* 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness
* 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object
* 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt
* 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph
* 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying
* 6th level (1 slot): eyebite

For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier.

***Hag Eye.*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.

A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

## Annis Hag
Annis hags lair in mountains or hills. Despite being hunchbacked and hump-shouldered, they are the largest and most physically imposing of their kind, standing eight feet tall.

***Tormenting the Weak.***. Although annis hags can easily tear a grown man apart, they love hunting children, preferring their flesh above all others. They use the flayed skin of such victims to make supple leather, and a hag's lair often shows the signs of this industry.

Annis hags leave tokens of their cruelty at the edges of forests and other areas they claim. In this way, they provoke fear and paranoia in nearby villages and settlements. To an annis hag, nothing is sweeter than turning a vibrant community into a place paralyzed with terror, where folk never venture out at night, strangers are met with suspicion and anger, and parents warn their children to "be good, or the annis will get you."

***Child Corrupter.***. When an annis feels especially cruel, she disguises herself as a kindly-looking elderly woman, approaches a child in a remote place, and gives it an iron token that it can use to confide in her. Over time, "Granny" convinces the child that it's okay to have bad thoughts and do bad deeds — starting with breaking things or wandering outside without permission, then graduating to pushing someone down the stairs or setting a house on fire. Sooner or later, the child's family and community become terrified of the "bad seed" and must face the awful decision of whether the child should be punished or exiled.

***Tribe Mother.***. Much in the way that they befriend children in order to corrupt them, annis hags have a tendency for adopting a group of ogres, trolls, or other loutish creatures, ruling them through brute strength, verbal abuse, and superstition.

***Iron Tokens.*** An annis hag can pull out one of her iron teeth or nails and spend 1 minute shaping and polishing it into the form of a coin, a ring, or a tiny mirror. Thereafter, any creature that holds this iron token can have a whispered conversation with the hag, provided the creature and the hag are on the same plane of existence and within 10 miles of each other. The holder of the token can hear only the hag's voice, not those of any other creatures or any ambient noise around the hag. Similarly, the hag can hear the holder of the token and not the noise around it.

A hag can have up to three iron tokens active at one time. As an action, she can discern the direction and approximate distance to all of her active tokens. She can instantaneously deactivate any of her tokens at any distance (no action required), whereupon the token retains its current form but loses its magical properties.

## Bheur Hag
Bheur hags live in wintry lands, favoring snow-covered mountains. They become more active during winter, using their ice and weather magic to make life miserable for nearby settlements.

A bheur hag's skin is blue-white, like that of a person who has frozen to death. Her hair is pale white, and she is emaciated, as if she were a person who had survived winter by eating bark and leather. Her eyes are pale and surrounded by dark, bruise-colored flesh. A bheur carries a twisted gray wooden staff, which she can ride like a flying broom and augments her magical powers.

***Cold Hearts.***. Bheur hags are attracted to selfish actions justified by deadly cold, such as murdering a traveler for a winter coat, chopping down a dryad's grove for firewood, and so on. These actions are especially sweet to a bheur if they are unwarranted, such as a greedy merchant hoarding more food for the winter than he could possibly eat while others starve. Bheurs love to seed such ideas and thoughts in mortals. They use their ability to manipulate weather to batter villages with snow and freezing cold, hoping to instill despair that turns the villagers against each other.

A bheur hag loves watching unprepared people suffer and die for their mistakes during the winter. She is delighted when mortals make petty, pathetic attempts to survive, such as eating boots and leather scraps when no real food is to be found.

***Awful to Behold.***. When a bheur hag is fully in the throes of combat and has recently slain one of her foes, she often forgoes a direct attack on her remaining enemies and instead takes a moment to feed on the corpse, dismembering it and tearing meat from bone. The sight of this savagery is enough to render witnesses temporarily insane.

>>***Graystaff Magic.***. The hag carries a graystaff, a length of gray wood that is a focus for her inner power. She can ride the staff as if it were a broom of flying. While holding the staff, she can cast additional spells with her Innate Spellcasting trait (these spells are marked with an asterisk). If the staff is lost or destroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a day. Only a bheur hag can use a graystaff.
>
>***Ice Walk.***. The hag can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost her extra moment.
>
>***Innate Spellcasting.***. The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
>
>At will: hold person,* ray of frost
>
>3/day each: cone of cold,* ice storm,* wall of ice*
>
>1/day each: control weather
>
>#### Actions
>***Slam.***. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d8 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.
>
>***Maddening Feast.***. The hag feasts on the corpse of one enemy within 5 feet of her that died within the past minute. Each creature of the hag's choice that is within 60 feet of her and able to see her must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of her for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature is incapacitated, can't understand what others say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the DM controls the creature's movement, which is erratic. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours.

## Cinder Hag
![](Hag-Cinder.png) | Cinder hags can be found wherever temperatures are high, such as sun-baked deserts, steaming jungles and scorched plains. Cinder hags have coal-black skin and piercing red eyes, while their hair is a mixture of red and orange and occasionally moves on its own, such that it resembles a burning fire. A cinder hag often rubs her skin with ash and charcoal, though they prefer bone ash from intelligent creatures, humanoids in particular.

**Incendiary Fey**. Cinder hags have a grim fascination with watching things burn, though nothing pleases a cinder hag more than watching a humanoid settlement burn. Fire is essential to many crafts that settled people cannot live without, such as metalworking, but when fire grows uncontrolled, it is wild and destructive.

At the heart of every cinder hag's lair burns a great fire called a grimflame. While the hag lives, this fire cannot be extinguished by nonmagical means. Through the fire, she sees distant occurrences, and she can command it to rise at her order. A grimflame must be at least 10 feet high and 10 feet wide for the hag to use its magic. While the hag is within 10 feet of her grimflame, she can use an action to percieve anything happening within 1 mile of the grimflame, as if she had cast the [scrying](../Magic/Spells/scrying.md) spell.

Cinder hags often bind creatures of elemental fire into serving them. Most cinder hag lairs are infested with [magmin](Elemental.md#magmin)s, while the most powerful of cinder hags bind efreeti into their service.

A cinder hag possesses the ability to teleport great distances, but only if her destination is near a large, open conflagration. When she does so, she leaves a faint cloud of foul-smelling smoke in her wake.

## Crimson Hag
The mad crimson hags are known for reveling in blood, fire, ashes, and destruction. More than anything, they enjoy starting fires that consume entire communities, especially if they can trick the inhabitants into being trapped within the conflagration. They often appear in the flames and smoke, cackling and taunting their helpless victims as they reveal their true ashen, gray form and their burning red eyes.

When they can't ignite an entire village or town, these hags settle for using their illusory disguises to frame others for arson and cause chaos that way. Crimson hags have just as much love for deception as other hags, and often pose as diviners that peer into mystical flames when enacting their schemes. Their most favorite trick is to be "captured" as a witch and burned at the stake, cackling madly as they turn the flames on their captors.

***Maddened By Terrors.*** The sight of fresh blood drives a crimson hag into a temporary state of madness. In this blood madness, the hag experiences hallucinations of horrors and terrors, shrieking things that test one's sanity, and visions from beyond By the time they are adults, crimson hags have been driven to a constant state of half-madness, and they no longer fear not only their own hallucinations, but anything at all These hags enjoy the rush they feel while in the blood madness, and eagerly scheme for their best opportunity to enter the state and enjoy the reckless sadism that it brings to the fullest before the blood madness ends.

***Self-Destructive Covens.*** There are many reasons why a coven of crimson hags, once established, rarely lasts very long. The most prominent is the hags' love for wanton destruction and especially their blood madness. In the throes of the madness, a crimson hag will often attack its own allies, including other crimson hags within the coven, if they are nearby. Of course, even without the blood madness, a crimson hag's love for ruin, destruction, and deception make schemes of betrayal and sabotage all the more enticing. However, this results in great collateral damage. When a powerful coven of crimson hags self-destructs, it can cause untold carnage, destruction, and death across the land.

She has advantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration or resist enchantment spells, she can't be charmed, and her speed is increased by 10 feet.

## Desert Hag
![](Hag-Desert.png) | Tan hunched, emaciated, and sun-shriveled, the desert hags tread slowly and steadily across the dunes searching for lost travelers to entice and devour. If the target is well-provisioned, the hag uses her powers of illusion to appear as a lost and beautiful traveler in dire need of assistance. If the target is in need, she uses her abilities to appear as a beautiful traveler awaiting them in a secluded oasis. Her goal is to use her magical kiss upon her victim, charming them and luring them back to her lair to be devoured in safety.

***Person Jerky.*** Desert hags often roam the desert in long and winding journeys, so they often dry and salt the meat of their victims, making jerky and other cured meats out of the hapless humanoids that they encounter and consume. They carry some of this dried meat with them on their journeys, sustaining themselves with it when prey is too sparse or dangerous.

***Mirage Weavers.*** Desert hags use their powers of illusion to weave detailed mirages over the landscape, disguising their lairs as something less frightening or creating the right desert backdrop to enact their deceptions in. They take great pride in the efficacy of these mirages, and can be thrown into a rage if her illusory weaving is insulted or belittled.

## Green Hag
The wretched and hateful green hags dwell in dying forests, lonely swamps, and misty moors, making their homes in caves. Green hags love to manipulate other creatures into doing their bidding, masking their intentions behind layers of deception. They lure victims to them by mimicking voices calling out for help, or drive unwanted visitors away by imitating the cries of fierce beasts.

***Obsession with Tragedy.*** Green hags revel in the failings and tragedies of other creatures. They derive joy from bringing people low and seeing hope turn into despair, not just for individuals but also for whole nations.

Sly and subversive, night hags want to see the virtuous turn to villainy: love turned into obsession, kindness turned to hate, devotion to disregard, and generosity to selfishness. Night hags take perverse joy in corrupting mortals.

Night hags were once creatures of the Feywild, but their foulness saw them exiled to Hades long ago, where they degenerated into fiends. The night hags have long since spread across the Lower Planes.

***Night Hag Items.*** A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft for herself.

* *Heartstone.* This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.

* *Soul Bag.* When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).

If either object is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time and effort.

***Soulmongers.*** While a humanoid sleeps, a night hag can straddle the person ethereally and intrude upon its dreams. Any creature with truesight can see the hag's spectral form straddling its prey. The ethereal hag fills her victim's head with doubts and fears, in the hope of tricking it into performing evil acts in the waking world. The hag continues her nightly visitations until the victim finally expires in its sleep. If the hag has driven her victim to commit evil deeds, she traps its corrupted soul in her soul bag for transport to Hades.

>***Change Shape.*** The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.
>
>***Etherealness.*** The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.
>
>***Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).*** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.

## Sea Hag
Sea hags live in dismal and polluted underwater lairs, surrounded by merrow and other aquatic monsters.

Beauty drives a sea hag to fits of anger. When confronted with something beautiful, the hag might simply attack it or deface it. If something beautiful gives hope, a sea hag wants it to cause despair. If it inspires courage, the sea hag wants it to cause fear.

***Ugly Inside and Out.*** Sea hags are by far the ugliest of all hags, with slimy scales covering their pallid skin. A sea hag's hair resembles seaweed and covers her emaciated body, and her glassy eyes seem as lifeless as a doll's. Although a sea hag can hide her true form under a veil of illusion, the hag is cursed to forever appear ugly. Her illusory form appears haggard at best.

>___
>***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.
>
>***Horrific Appearance.*** Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.
>
>Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.
>
>#### Actions
>***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
>
>***Death Glare.*** The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.
>
>***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.
>
>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

## Storm Hag
A storm hag spends most of her time watching the weather and planning. She appears at first as a shrunken elderly woman with wiry and scattered hair that often looks like a gray thundercloud, and she greets visitors warmly. Yet behind this congenial mask they present for first impressions, these hags are just as malicious as any other. These sea witches are fond of deceptive deals and trades, and frequently make victims of both Undersea folk as well as "land-dweller" folk. To the Undersea folk, she will often appear as a elderly female triton or merfolk; to the Abovesea, typically human. Their true forms have bone-white skin that is covered in twisted electrical scars, but they reveal these forms only right before they finally consume a hapless and ruined victim.

Storm hags take sadistic joy in making bargains, contracts, and deals that turn unexpectedly against their victims and ruin their lives - more than any other kind of hag. These hags always prefer to use such a bargain when inflicting suffering, and find the chaotic nature of other hags to be distasteful at best. 

***Weather Diviners.*** The sky and the movement of clouds - or the currents of the ocean - are like a swirling map of the future to the eldritch eyes of an aquatic storm hag. They use these weather auguries to inform their decisions when making their dark bargains, as well as using the information as bargaining chips directly. 

***Bottling a Storm.*** Storm hags gain their name not only from their innate affinity for storms, but also from their practice of capturing pieces of storm clouds. These hags venture into thunderstorms armed with special magic bottles that they use to siphon a chunk of the cloud's primal magic, sealing the bottle to contain it. They use these bottled storms to focus their magic, to observe in lieu of real storms, or even to unleash as a measure of self-defense. Adventurers who slay a storm hag often make use of the bottled storms she has lining the shelves inside of her lair.

Some storm hags can animate small clouds to sit and ride upon to fly through the sky without effort. Such a cloud acts as a carpet of flying that can be contained or released from a bottle by speaking its command word Capricious Wrath. While storm hags excel at hiding their wicked nature behind a mask of friendly warmth, their true emotions are always swirling underneath the surface, ready to be unleashed at a moment's notice. The wrong move or word can take a storm hag from dignified friendliness into a tempestuous rage. Should you manage to outsmart them in one of their dark bargains, you may find the storm hag's rage to be neverending, and legends say her wrath may persist in some eldritch form even after her death ...

>
>***Bottled Storm (7/Day).*** The hag releases the storm cloud she had saved in a bottle. The area within 60 feet of the hag becomes heavily obscured difficult terrain for l minute. The hag ignores this difficult terrain. A creature that begins its turn in the area or enters it for the first time on a turn takes l 3 (3d8) lightning damage.
>
>### Reactions
>***Cloud Form.*** When the hag would be hit by a melee attack, she can transform into a cloud for a moment (or a cloud of black ink when used underwater), causing the attack to miss. When she does, she can fly or swim up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks before she returns to normal, at which point she falls if she is still aloft and cannot fly.
