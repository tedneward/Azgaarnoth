## Brother of Sanctity
Of all the Brothers of Undeath, perhaps none are more feared than the Brothers of Sanctity, which have somehow retained a connection to a divine being despite their unholy state.

>
>***Siphon Soul.*** The Brothers of Sanctity are able to siphon the souls of others and use them as energy sources. If the Brother is able to make a successful Claw attack, or if it hits with a ranged spell attack, it can attempt to siphon the soul of its target. The target must make a Intelligence (DC 15) save, or suffer 1d3 temporary Intelligence damage. The Brother then gains six times the suffered damage in temporary hit points, possibly exceeding its hit point maximum. Alternatively, it can restore 1 level of spell slot per point of Intelligence damage. Any creature reduced to 0 Intelligence falls unconscious.
