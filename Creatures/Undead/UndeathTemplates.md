# Templates: Undeath
Transformation into undeath is often seen as a fiercely evil act, although some may propose justifications for it at the time.

These templates are for those creatures that are humanoid or close to it; [dragons](Dragon.md) use their own template for undeath transformations.

Note that for all templates "CR" reflects the base creature's challenge rating. When used in calculating save DCs, CR 0-3 = save DC 13, CR 4 = save DC 14, CR 5-7 = save DC 15, as per DMG p 274
