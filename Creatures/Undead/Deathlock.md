# Deathlock
[!Deathlock](Deathlock.png)

The forging of a pact between a warlock and a patron is no minor occasion — at least not for the warlock. The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock who fails to live up to a bargain with an evil patron runs the risk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foul undead driven to serve its otherworldly patron from beyond the grave.

An extraordinarily powerful necromancer might also discover the dark methods of creating a deathlock and then bind it to service, acting in this respect as the deathlock’s patron.

**Obedient and Obsessed.** An overpowering urge to serve consumes the mind of a newly awakened deathlock. All goals and ambitions it had in life that don’t please its patron fall away as its master’s desires become the purpose that drives the deathlock. The creature immediately resumes work on its patron’s behalf. Accomplishing a difficult goal might mean the deathlock is forced to serve another powerful creature or might entail in gathering servants of its own.

Whatever the goal, it always reflects the patron’s interests, ranging from small-scale concerns to matters of cosmic scope. A deathlock in the thrall of a fiend might work to destroy a specific temple dedicated to a good god, while one that serves a Great Old One could be charged with hunting for the materials needed to call forth a horrifying entity into the world.

**Undead Nature.** A deathlock doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Patron-Specific Spells** You can customize a deathlock by replacing some or all of the spells in its Spellcasting trait with spells specific to its patron. Here are examples.

If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become restrained as shadowy tendrils wrap around it for 1 minute. A restrained target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Description
Though deathlocks exist to serve their patrons, they retain some freedom when it comes to devising particular tactics and carrying out their plans. Powerful deathlocks recruit lesser creatures to help them carry out their missions and, in this capacity, become the masterminds behind vast conspiracies and intrigues that culminate in the accomplishment of great acts of evil.

Challenge 3 (700 XP)

Innate Spellcasting. The wight’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no verbal or material components:

At will: detect magic, disguise self, mage armor

1/day each: fear, hold person, misty step

Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the wight has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Actions

Multiattack. The wight attacks twice with Grave Bolt.

Grave Bolt. Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) necrotic damage.

Life Drain. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie under the wight’s control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve zombies under its control at one time.

#### Description
Bereft of much of its magic, a deathlock wight lingers between the warlock it was and the deathly existence of a wight — a special punishment meted out by certain patrons and necromancers.
