## Actions
**Charge**. If the bluespawn thunderlizard moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 14 (2d8 +5) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is an object or structure (wall, etc) then the thunderlizard gains advantage on the attack and damage rolls.

**Gore**. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage.

**Lightning Arc (Recharge 5-6)**. The bluespawn stormlizard arcs lightning in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that cone must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Reaction
**Electricity Link**. A bluespawn stormlizard can cause a line of electricity to fire from its horn to that of another bluespawn stormlizard within 100 feet. Creatures in the line must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d10 (11) points of lightning damage.
