# Creature: Blue Dragon

## Blue Dragon [Feats](DraconicFeats.md)
The following feats can only be taken by blue dragons.
Lightning Aura
Prerequisite: must be Juvenile or older.
Each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the
dragon or moves there for the first time on its turn takes 5
(1d10) lightning damage.
Lightning Marksman
Whenever the dragon uses its Lightning Breath, it can double
the breath's range. If the breath is modified in this way, it
deals half of its usual damage.
Horn Attack
Prerequisite: must have Multiattack.
When the dragon uses its Multiattack action option,
instead of making a Bite attack, the dragon can make a Horn
attack.
Horn. Melee Weapon Attack: bonus to hit and reach are
equal to Bite attack, one target. Hit: (1d12 + Strength
modifier) bludgeoning damage, plus an additional 6 (1d12)
damage for each size category the dragon is above Medium.
If the dragon is Huge or larger, the target must make a
Constitution saving throw (save DC = 8 + the dragon's
proficiency bonus + the dragon's Strength modifier) or be
stunned until the end of its next turn.
Primeval Lightning
Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.
The dragon's attacks ignore resistance to lightning
damage. When the dragon rolls lightning damage, it can treat
any 1 rolled on a damage die as a 2. In addition, a creature in
metal armor has disadvantage on saving throws to evade the
dragon's Breath Weapon.
Sky Camouflage
The dragon can use the Hide action when it is flying at a
higher altitude than those it is hiding from, even if there is
nowhere to hide.
Sound Imitation
Prerequisite: must be Juvenile or older.
The dragon can mimic any sound or voice that it has heard,
any time it likes. To discern the ruse, a creature can attempt a
Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the dragon's Charisma
(Deception) check. If the creature wins the contest, it learns
that the sound is false, but doesn't learn its source.
Storm Dragon
The dragon can fly normally even in storm-strength winds. In
addition, its vision is not obscured by precipitation, and it
ignores cover granted by rain. The dragon also gains
resistance to thunder damage.
Stunning Lightning
Prerequisite: Primeval Lightning.
A creature who fails its saving throw against the dragon's
Breath Weapon is also stunned until the end of the dragon's
next turn.
Thunder Breath
Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.
The dragon gains the following action option:
Thunder Breath (1/Day). The dragon calls upon the
powers of the storm to unleash a monstrous roar that shakes
the foundations of the world. All creatures within the range
must make a Constitution saving throw (save DC = Lightning
Breath save DC), taking thunder damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one. A creature who
fails the save is also stunned until the end of its next turn.
The range and damage are given in the following table.
Thunder Breath
Dragon Age Range (radius) Damage
Mature Adult 80 feet 77 (14d10)
Old 100 feet 88 (16d10)
Elder 120 feet 93 (17d10)
Ancient 140 feet 99 (18d10)
Wyrm 170 feet 104 (19d10)
Great Wyrm 200 feet 110 (20d10)
Veil
Prerequisite: must be Ancient or older.
The dragon gains the following action option:
Veil (1/Day). The dragon casts seeming, but it can target
each creature within its lair that it is aware of. The dragon
can perfectly replicate specific creatures and objects that it
has seen. The effects are otherwise identical to the spell's
description.
Ventriloquism
Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.
The dragon can “throw” its voice (or any other sound it
makes) to make it sound like it is coming from a point or
creature of its choice that it can see within 120 feet of it. A
creature who succeeds on a Wisdom (Insight) check against
the dragon's Charisma (Deception) check recognizes it as
illusory, but doesn't discern the sound's true source.
