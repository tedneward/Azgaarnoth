# Creature: Red Dragon

## Red Dragon [Feats](DraconicFeats.md)
Appraise
The dragon automatically knows the exact value of
something only by looking at it.
Death Throes
When the dragon dies, a final blast of fire marks its demise.
Each creature within 30 feet of it must make a Dexterity
saving throw (save DC = Fire Breath save DC), taking fire
damage equal to the damage dealt by its Fire Breath on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The
explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't
being worn or carried.
Discern Location
Prerequisite: must be Ancient or older.
The dragon gains the following action option:
Discern Location (3/Day). The dragon can immediately
learn the exact location of any item it has touched or any
creature it has seen (or has a belonging of), as long as the two
are on the same plane of existence. Nothing will block this
ability other than a wish, a mind blank spell, or the
intervention of deity.
Exceptional Hearing
The dragon's blindsight radius increases by 50%.
Fire Aura
Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.
Each creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of the
dragon or moves into that area for the first time on its turn
takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.
Ignite
When a creature or flammable object takes fire damage from
the dragonâ€™s breath weapon, it ignites. An ignited target takes
7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turn, cannot
take reactions, and has disadvantage on attack rolls until it or
another creature uses an action to extinguish the flames.
Overheat
Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.
The dragon's temperature evaporates ice in its immediate
vicinity, including such effects from magic or spells. As a
result, the dragon is resistant to cold damage.
Scorching Flames
Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.
The dragon's attacks ignore resistance to fire damage.
When the dragon rolls fire damage, it can treat any 1 rolled
on a damage die as a 2.
Smokescreen
The dragon gains the following Breath Weapon option:
Smokescreen. The dragon exhales a cloud of black smoke,
with the same range and shape as its Fire Breath. The smoke
spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. All
creatures in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw (save DC = Fire Breath save DC) or be blinded for one
minute. A creature can attempt the saving throw again at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success.
Additionally, a creature that starts its turn in the smoke or
enters that area for the first time on its turn takes 7 (2d6) fire
damage, and must make a Constitution saving throw (same
DC as above). On a failed save, the creature's speed is
reduced by half, and it spends its action that turn choking as
the smoke overwhelms its lungs. Creatures that do not need
to breathe air automatically succeed the save.
The smoke lasts until the dragon uses its Breath Weapon
again or until it is cleared with a strong wind. The dragon is
immune to all of these effects.

Torch
Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.
When the dragon uses its Fire Breath, the Breath
Weapon's area becomes engulfed in flames for 3 (1d6)
rounds. If a creature starts its turn in the engulfed area or
enters the area for the first time on its turn, it takes 7 (2d6)
fire damage.
