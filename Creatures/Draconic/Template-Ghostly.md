# Creature Template: Ghostly Dragon
A ghostly dragon is sometimes created when a powerful dragon is killed and its hoard looted, or when something of similar caliber happens to a living dragon. The dragon can only be laid to rest by setting right whatever wrong caused it to appear; in the former example, the hoard (or treasure of equivalent value) would have to be returned to the dragon's lair, at which point the dragon would sleep atop it and pass on to the afterlife with the entirety of the hoard. 

When a dragon becomes a ghostly dragon, it retains its statistics, except as described below. The dragon loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The dragon retains none of its lair actions, but retains all of its legendary actions.

**Type.** The dragon's type changes from dragon to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Speed.** The dragon retains all of its speeds, and can hover.

**Damage Resistances.** The dragon gains resistance to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons.

**Damage Immunities.** The dragon gains immunity to cold, necrotic, and poison damage. It also retains any immunities that it had in life.

**Condition Immunities.** The dragon gains immunity to the charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, and restrained conditions. It also doesn't suffer from exhaustion.

**Special Abilities.** The dragon loses all supernatural and spell-like abilities that it possessed in life, including its Breath Weapon. It retains its Frightful Presence.

**Damage Type.** The dragon's Bite, Claw, Tail, and Wing attacks deal necrotic damage rather than the damage type they dealt before.

**New Trait: Ethereal Sight.** The dragon can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

**New Trait: Incorporeal Movement.** The dragon can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**New Trait: Rejuvenation.** If the dragon is destroyed, it reappears in its lair 2d4 days later with all its hit points. The only way to completely be rid of the dragon is to determine the reason for its existence and resolve the issue.

**New Action: Etherealness.** The dragon enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
