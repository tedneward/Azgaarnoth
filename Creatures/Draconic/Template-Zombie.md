# Creature Template: Zombie Dragon
Zombie dragons are created through spells such as [animate dead](). Such a dragon has no memory of its former life or self, and functions identically to any other zombie, though it retains some of its abilities and powers because of its draconic nature.

When a dragon becomes a zombie dragon, it retains its statistics, except as described below. The dragon loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The dragon retains none of its lair actions or legendary actions.

**Type.** The dragon's type changes from dragon to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Speed.** All of the dragon's speeds are reduced by 10 feet.

**Armor Class.** Modify the dragon's Armor Class by applying a -2 penalty.

**Damage Immunities.** The dragon gains immunity to poison damage. It also retains any immunities it had in life.

**Condition Immunities.** The dragon gains immunity to the poisoned condition and retains any immunities that it had in life. It also doesn't suffer from exhaustion.

**Special Abilities.** The dragon loses all supernatural and spell-like abilities that it possessed in life, including its Breath Weapon. It retains its Frightful Presence.

**Skills.** The dragon loses all skill proficiencies.

**Dragon Feats.** The dragon loses all feats that it had taken in life.

**New Trait: Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.
