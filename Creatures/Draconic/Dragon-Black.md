# Creature: Black Dragon


## Black Dragon [Feats](DraconicFeats.md)
Acid Blast
Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.
The dragon gains a new Breath Weapon option:
Acid Blast. The dragon chooses a point on the ground within
60 feet of it that it can see, and then exhales an acidic bomb
that lands on that point. All creatures within 20 feet of that
point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take
damage equal to half of the dragon's Acid Breath damage, or
half as much damage on a successful save. A pool of residual
acid forms in that same area. Any creature that starts its turn
in the pool or enters the area for the first time on its turn
takes 13 (3d8) acid damage. The pool is difficult terrain and
dissipates after 3 (1d6) rounds, or until cleared (such as by
running water).
Acidic Blood
When the dragon has half of its hit points remaining or less,
if it is hit by an attack from a creature within 5 feet of it, the
attacker takes 9 (2d8) acid damage.
Charm Reptiles
Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.
The dragon gains the following action option:
Charm Reptiles (3/Day). The dragon casts animal friendship
on all reptiles within 30 feet of it, without requiring
material components. The dragon can communicate with any
charmed animals as if it had cast a speak with animals spell.
Corrupt Water
Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.
The dragon gains the following action option:
Corrupt Water (1/Day). The dragon magically stagnates
up to 10 cubic feet of a body of water that it can see within
120 feet of it, making it become still, foul, and unable to
sustain animal life. The water remains corrupt until purified,
such as by a purify food and drink spell. Any creature to drink
the water regurgitates it in 1d4 minutes and must succeed on
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.
Death Dragon
The dragon has resistance to necrotic and poison damage,
and has advantage on saving throws made to resist becoming
poisoned.
Horn Parry
The dragon gains the following reaction option:
Horn Parry. The dragon adds 3 to its AC against one
melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the dragon must be
aware of the attacker.
Potent Acid
Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.
The dragon's attacks ignore resistance to acid
damage. When the dragon rolls acid damage, it
can treat any 1 rolled on a damage die as a 2.
Swamp Dragon
The dragon ignores cover granted by water, and has
advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide while
submerged.
Vile Resolve
The dragon can add double its proficiency bonus on saving
throws against being charmed, dominated, or frightened.
Viscous Acid
If a creature takes damage from the dragon's Breath Weapon,
acid sticks to the creature's armor and flesh. At the beginning
of each of its turns, the creature takes 9 (2d8) acid damage
until it or another creature takes an action to either clean off
or neutralize the acid.
