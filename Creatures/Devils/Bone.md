## Bone Devil
Driven by hate, lust, and envy, bone devils act as the cruel taskmasters of the Nine Hells. They set weaker devils to work, taking special delight in seeing fiends that defy them demoted. At the same time, they long for promotion and are bitterly envious of their superiors, attempting to curry favor though it irks them to do so.

A bone devil appears as a humanoid husk, with dried skin stretched tight across its skeletal frame. It bears a fearsome skull-like head and the tail of a scorpion, and a foul odor of decay hangs in the air around it. Though they are devastating in combat with their claws, bone devils also wield hooked polearms made of bone, which they use to subdue enemies before striking with their venomous tails.

### Bone Devil Polearm
Some bone devils have the following action options.

> ***Multiattack.*** The devil makes two attacks: one with its hooked polearm and one with its sting.
> 
> ***Hooked Polearm.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d12 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the devil can't use its polearm on another target.
> 

This pole arm disappears if the devil is apart from it for more than 1 minute.

>***Summon Devil (1/Day).*** The devil chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning. A bone devil has a 40 percent chance of summoning 2d6 spined devils or one bone devil. A summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other devils. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
