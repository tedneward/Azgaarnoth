## Erinyes
The most beautiful and striking of all lesser and greater devils, the erinyes are fierce and disciplined warriors. Sweeping down from the skies, they bring swift death to creatures that have wronged their masters or defied the edicts of Asmodeus. The erinyes appear as male or female humanoids with statuesque builds and large feathery wings. Most wear stylized armor and horned helms, and carry exquisite swords and bows. A few also use ropes of entanglement to ensnare powerful foes.

Legends tell that the first erinyes were angels that fell from the Upper Planes because of temptation or misdeed. Erinyes are always willing to take advantage of being mistaken for celestials in their missions of conquest and corruption.

>
>***Magic Resistance.*** The erinyes has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
>***Summon Devil (1/Day).*** The devil chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning. An erinyes has a 50 percent chance of summoning 3d6 spined devils, 1d6 bearded devils, or one erinyes. A summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other devils. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

The poison lasts until it is removed by the lesser restoration spell or similar magic.
>
>***Rope of Entanglement.*** >Some erinyes carry a rope of entanglement (detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide). When such an erinyes uses its Multiattack, the erinyes can use the rope in place of two of the attacks.
>
