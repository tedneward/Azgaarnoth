## Merregon
The souls of fallen soldiers, mercenaries, and bodyguards who served evil without reservation often find everlasting servitude in the Nine Hells as merregons. These faceless foot soldiers are the Hells' legionnaires, tasked with protecting their infernal plane and its rulers against intruders.

Merregons have no individuality and hence no need for faces. Every merregon legionnaire has a metal mask bolted to its head. Markings on the mask indicate the only elements of the wearer's identity that matter: the commander it serves and the layer of the Nine Hells it protects.

Because of their unshakable loyalty, merregons form the backbone of many devils' protective retinues. They shrink from no task, no matter how dangerous. Unless ordered to fall back, they never retreat from a fight.
