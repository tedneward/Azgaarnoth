# Dragonspawn
The dragonspawn are an alchemical and magical experiment to stiffen the ranks of the chromatic dragons by the [Cult of the Wyrm](../Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md), among others. In essence, by taking a clutch of chromatic dragon eggs (most of which won't survive, owing to the predatory nature of chromatic dragon hatchlings) and bathing them in a particular alchemical stew accompanied by some twisted magic during their time in the egg, a half-dragon-like creature can emerge from the egg, ready almost immediately to wreak havoc on whatever happens to be nearby.

For whatever reasons, red dragon eggs seem immune to the treatment.

Unlike dragonborn, dragonspawn aren't always humanoid in nature--blackspawn emerge that way, but the rest take more to the animalistic nature of the dragon and are four-legged creatures.
