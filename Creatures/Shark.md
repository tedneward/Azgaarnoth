# Shark
Sharks are some of the most vicious predators of the sea, with normal sharks sometimes displaying a disheartening willingness to attack creatures larger than them (or not native to the sea). They are often the companions, familiars, or mounts for [Sahuagin](Sahuagin.md) tribes, particularly the larger varieties.

## Giant Shark
A giant shark is 30 feet long and normally found in deep oceans. Utterly fearless, it preys on anything that crosses its path, including whales and ships.

## Hunter Shark
Smaller than a giant shark but larger and fiercer than a reef shark, a hunter shark haunts deep waters. It usually hunts alone, but multiple hunter sharks might feed in the same area. A fully grown hunter shark is 15 to 20 feet long.
