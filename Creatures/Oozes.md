# Oozes
Oozes thrive in the dark, shunning areas of bright light and extreme temperatures. They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks. The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze's presence is often the searing pain of its acidic touch.

> Jump to: [Black Pudding](Oozes.md#black-pudding) | [Gelatinous Cube](Oozes.md#gelatinous-cube) | [Gray Ooze](Oozes.md#gray-ooze) | [Ochre Jelly](Oozes.md#ochre-jelly) | [Psychic Gray Ooze](Oozes.md#psychic-gray-ooze) | [Slithering Tracker](Oozes.md#slithering-tracker) | [Molten Ooze](Oozes.md#molten-ooze)

Oozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.

***Slow Death.*** An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim's comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.

Since not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.

***Unwitting Servants.*** Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.

***Spawn of Juiblex.*** According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex. Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.

***Ooze Nature.*** An ooze doesn't require sleep.

## Black Pudding
A black pudding resembles a heaving mound of sticky black sludge. In dim passageways, the pudding appears to be little more than a blot of shadow.

![](Oozes-BlackPudding.png)

Flesh, wood, metal, and bone dissolve when the pudding ebbs over them. Stone remains behind, wiped clean.

## Gelatinous Cube
Gelatinous cubes scour dungeon passages in silent, predictable patterns, leaving perfectly clean paths in their wake. They consume living tissue while leaving bones and other materials undissolved.

![](Oozes-GelatinousCube.png)

A gelatinous cube is all but transparent, making it hard to spot until it attacks. A cube that is well fed can be easier to spot, since its victims' bones, coins, and other objects can be seen suspended inside the creature.

## Slithering Tracker
The quest for revenge sometimes leads one to undergo a ritual whereby they transform into a body of semiliquid sentience known as a slithering tracker. Innocuous and insidious at the same time, a tracker flows into places where a normal creature can't go and brings its own brand of watery death down upon its quarry.

***Vengeance at Any Cost.*** The ritual for creating a slithering tracker is known to hags, liches, and priests who worship gods of vengeance. It can only be performed on a willing creature that hungers for revenge. The ritual sucks all the moisture from the person's body, killing it. Yet the mind lives on in the puddle of liquid that issues forth from the remains, and so too does the subject's insatiable need for retribution.

***Stealthy Assassins.*** A slithering tracker tastes the ground it courses over, seeking any trace of its prey. To kill, a slithering tracker rises up and enshrouds a creature, attempting to drown the prey while also draining it of blood. A slithering tracker that has killed in this fashion becomes much easier to locate for a time, since its liquid form becomes tinged with blood and its body leaves a visible trail of the stuff behind it.

***Descent into Madness.*** Achieving revenge against its target doesn't end a slithering tracker's existence, nor its hunger for blood. Some slithering trackers remain aware of their purpose and extend their quest for vengeance to others, such as anyone who supported or befriended the original target. Most of the time, though, a tracker's mind can't cope with being trapped in liquid form, unable to communicate, and driven by the desire for blood: after a tracker fulfills its duty, insanity takes over the creature, and it attacks indiscriminately until it is destroyed.

## Molten Ooze
Oozes are simple-minded, amorphous creatures that live only to consume. Some oozes take on elemental traits, such as the heated kind known as a molten ooze. It is mottled with red and black and speckled with orange flecks, and is easily mistaken for lava itself. Its body is dense, viscous, and resilient against harm. These oozes are extremely dangerous for novice adventurers.

When a molten ooze moves, it rolls like a slow, fiery bubble, or flows like a slithering trickle of lava. Any organic material it moves over is dissolved, and any remains are seared to ash, which the ooze will also consume. It leaves stone and metal unharmed.

Molten oozes typically dwell within volcanoes or fiery caverns beneath the earth, although some lurk in alleys and abandoned buildings in the City of Brass, the efreeti capital in the Elemental Plane of Fire. Some efreeti even keep these oozes as pets, using them to dispose of waste and to clean surfaces in their palaces. In a pinch, the oozes can even serve as defenders against enemies, but anyone who keeps an ooze as a pet knows that the ooze doesn't distinguish friend from food, especially in the chaos of a frenzied battle.

## Winter Ooze
Oozes are simple-minded, amorphous creatures that live only to consume. Some oozes take on elemental traits, such as the frozen kind known as a winter ooze. It is often a murky white or clear, speckled with off-white flecks, and is easily mistaken for a pool of cold water or a formation of ice. Its body is dense, viscous, and resilient against harm. These oozes are extremely dangerous for novice adventurers.

When a molten ooze moves, it rolls like a slow, icy ball, or flows like a slithering trickle of slush. Any organic material it moves over is dissolved, and any remains are frozen and shattered, which the ooze will also consume. It leaves stone and metal unharmed.

Frozen oozes typically dwell within glaciers or frozen caverns in arctic conditions, although some lurk in alleys and abandoned buildings in the City of Ice, the capital in the Elemental Plane of Ice. For some who keep the frozen oozes as pets, the oozes can even serve as defenders against enemies, but anyone who keeps an ooze as a pet knows that the ooze doesn't distinguish friend from food, especially in the chaos of a frenzied battle.
