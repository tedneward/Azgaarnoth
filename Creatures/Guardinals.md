# Guardinals
From the mountains of Celestia, the lawful good angels reign supreme. Down in the depths of Carceri, the Nine Hells, and the Abyss, fi ends fester in the dark corners of their forgotten planes. There are other beings of similar power elsewhere in the cosmos, but few as overlooked as the guardinal.

These beings resemble humanoids with animal heads, which gives them a very distinct and disparate appearance. This impression quickly falls away when you sit down to enjoy a discussion with one. Guardinals are the near definition of honor and goodness. A guardinal will never lie, never cheat, never take a duplicitous path. All guardinals are about living in the moment, and just enjoying what is; not worrying about what might be, or being attached to what was. 

While there are many forms of guardinal, the most common ones were rodent-headed, goat-headed, wolfheaded, horse-headed, bird-headed, bear-headed, and feline-headed. It is rare to fi nd a permanent city of guardinals. They have a tendency to wander a nomadic lifestyle alone, in pairs, or in small groups of friends. 

Roleplay tips for guardinals: A guardinal should always be finding the silver lining in a situation. They’re always smiling, enjoying themselves, whatever situation they find themselves in. They’re fun and kind when treated as equals and with respect. However, any sign of an evil deed will have them as quick to act as a bulwark, placing themselves directly between that evil and its goals.
