# Guardinals
From the mountains of Celestia, the lawful good angels reign supreme. Down in the depths of Carceri, the Nine Hells, and the Abyss, fi ends fester in the dark corners of their forgotten planes. There are other beings of similar power elsewhere in the cosmos, but few as overlooked as the guardinal.

These beings resemble humanoids with animal heads, which gives them a very distinct and disparate appearance. This impression quickly falls away when you sit down to enjoy a discussion with one. Guardinals are the near definition of honor and goodness. A guardinal will never lie, never cheat, never take a duplicitous path. All guardinals are about living in the moment, and just enjoying what is; not worrying about what might be, or being attached to what was. 

While there are many forms of guardinal, the most common ones were rodent-headed, goat-headed, wolfheaded, horse-headed, bird-headed, bear-headed, and feline-headed. It is rare to fi nd a permanent city of guardinals. They have a tendency to wander a nomadic lifestyle alone, in pairs, or in small groups of friends. 

Roleplay tips for guardinals: A guardinal should always be finding the silver lining in a situation. They’re always smiling, enjoying themselves, whatever situation they find themselves in. They’re fun and kind when treated as equals and with respect. However, any sign of an evil deed will have them as quick to act as a bulwark, placing themselves directly between that evil and its goals.

The guardinals live in the outer planes, centered on
Elysium, although many can be found in the service
of various deities. Like their angelic brethren, the
guardinals can shrug off most spells cast upon them and
are immune to many mundane woes like exhaustion.
While the selection of magic available to each type of
guardinal differs, they are all capable magic users and
healers.
Guardinals are virtuous creatures, holding themselves
above capricious acts such as lying, stealing, or
cheating. This makes guardinals valuable peacekeepers
to other beings of the outer planes.
Tranquility of Nature. Guardinals love their home
plane of Elysium for what it is; a picturesque image
of nature in balance. To a mortal visiting their plane,
it might remind them of a peaceful garden, or a quiet
glade. Everything seems peaceful and safe, and that’s
the way the guardinals want to keep things.
Should an invading force threaten to disturb this
tranquility, they should be prepared for the full might
of the guardinals to fall upon their heads.
Beings Of Goodness. While angels are shards of
divinity, splintered off and given form, the guardinals
are long-lived mortal beings more like the eladrin.
While they can be angered quickly, their defi ning trait is
more about passion. Their passion for the lovely things
in the world knows no bounds. Guardinals treasure
things like well-brewed tea or conversation had during
a sunset or a quiet walk on a beach. There’s nothing
better than a quiet happy sigh, to a guardinal.
Adventure on the Horizon. When not indulging in
their home plane, guardinals feel the need to fi nd work
worthy of their lot. Devoting themselves to the various
gods of the realms, whether wandering the outer planes
looking for trouble or just going on a walk-about to
see what they might fi nd, guardinals are the natural
adventurers of the universe.
Planar Creatures. Despite not being celestials,
elementas or fi ends, guardinals can be summoned using
the planar ally or planar binding spells.
