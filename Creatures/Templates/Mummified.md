## Mummified
An undead mummy is created when the priest of a death god or other dark deity ritually imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic magic. The mummy's linen wrappings are inscribed with necromantic markings before the burial ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a mummy endures in undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by the ritual. Most commonly, a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.

***Transformation.*** When a creature becomes a mummy, it retains all its characteristics except as described below.

* **Type.** The creature's type changes from creature to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.

* **Armor Class.** The creature's AC increases by +1, not taking into account equipment.

* **Hit Dice.** Change to d12.

* **Speed.** -10ft (minimum 10 ft). All other movement types are unchanged.

* **Ability Scores.** +4 Strength, -2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma or Intelligence.

* **Saving Throws.** Gain Wisdom saving throw proficiency.

* Add **Damage vulnerabilities** fire. 

* Add **Damage resistances** bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons

* Add **Damage immunities** necrotic and poison

* Add **Condition immunities** charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned.

* Add **Senses** Darkvision 60 ft.

* Add ***Multiattack*** if the creature did not have it already; if it had Multiattack already, add one more attack. If the creature has Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting, the mummy can use Spellcasting as one of its attacks.

* The mummy's attacks all gain the following text: "plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic."

* Add attack ***Dreadful Glare.*** The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC (CR - 2) Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.
