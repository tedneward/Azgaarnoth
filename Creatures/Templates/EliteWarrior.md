# Elite Warrior Template

* **Armor Class.** The creature gains up to a +3 bonus to its Armor Class. This could be through gaining new armor or a shield, or their natural armor is stronger than before.
* **Hit Points.** If the creature has 2 hit dice or less, triple the number of hit dice. If they have between 3 to 6, double the number of hit dice, and if they have 7 hit dice or more, multiply the number by 1.25.

* **Mental Ability Scores.** The creature gains a bonus to their mental abilities: Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The
bonuses are +2, +1, +0 and one ability score can not be chosen twice. A DM determines where each bonus goes.

            Add Legendary Action ***Weapon Attack.*** The creature makes a weapon attack.
