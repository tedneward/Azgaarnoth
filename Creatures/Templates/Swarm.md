# Swarm Template
Any creature can become a swarm so long as there are enough of them. Swarms are large groups of monsters consolidated down into a single entity to keep combat running fast. Swarms are best for low CR creatures.

When a creature joins a swarm, it retains its statistics except as described below. The DM may determine that a swarm gains or loses any new traits or abilities.

* **Creature Size.** If the creature is Tiny or Small, its size increases by two categories. If it is medium or larger, its size increases by one level. See chart below.
* **Hit Points.** If the creature has less than 5 hit die, its now has 8 hit die. If the creature has 5 hit die or more, double the number of hit die it has. The hit die changes based on its new size. See chart below.
* **Abilitiy Scores.** If the creature's strength is 6 or less, it becomes 8. Otherwise, the creature gains a +2 to its Strength ability score.
* **Damage Resistances.** The swarm has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* **Condition Immunities.** The swarm gains immunity to the following conditions: Charmed, Frightened, Grappled, Paralyzed, Petrified, Prone, Restrained, Stunned.
* **Challenge Rating.** This is more subjective, when you have completed your swarm consult the Chart below.
* **Add trait:** ***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a [original creature's size] creature. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
* **Add Attack:** The swarm keeps its old attack, but the reach is decreased by 5 feet. The damage is also replaced based off of its CR. See chart below. Once a swarm reaches half it's hit points, it rolls half the amount of damage dice.
* **Modifty Attack: Multiattack.** If a creature has multiattack, the swarm also has multiattack. In the Swarm CR & Damage chart, the MultiAttack column determines the amount of dice they roll for their first attack, located on the left side, and any remaining attacks use the damage dice on the right side.
* **Weapons.** Swarms still use their weapons to attack and damage, but their damage die is based on the Swarm Size Chart below. A DM may determine that changing the damage die to match the weapon would better reflect the swarm and its Challenge Rating.
