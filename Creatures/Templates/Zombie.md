# Creature Template: Zombie
Zombie creatures are created through spells such as [animate dead](../Magic/Spells/animate-dead.md). Such a creature has no memory of its former life or self, and functions identically to any other zombie, though it may retain some of its abilities and powers..

When a creature becomes a zombie creature, it retains its statistics, except as described below. The creature loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The creature retains none of its lair actions or legendary actions.

**Type.** The creature's type changes from creature to Undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Speed.** All of the creature's speeds are reduced by 10 feet.

**Armor Class.** Modify the creature's Armor Class by applying a -2 penalty.

**Damage Immunities.** The creature gains immunity to poison damage. It also retains any immunities it had in life.

**Condition Immunities.** The creature gains immunity to the poisoned condition and retains any immunities that it had in life. It also doesn't suffer from exhaustion.

**Special Abilities.** The creature loses all supernatural and spell-like abilities that it possessed in life.

**Skills.** The creature loses all skill proficiencies.

**Creature Feats.** The creature loses all feats that it had taken in life.

**New Trait: Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.
