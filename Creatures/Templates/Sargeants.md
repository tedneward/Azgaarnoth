## Template: Sargeant
Sargeants are commanders of the smallest units of military organization. They are typically seasoned fighters in their own right, but also know how to command and protect the troops within their unit.

***Transformation.*** A sargeant retains all their previous characteristics.

* Add 5 to 8 more Hit Dice to the base creature, depending on how long the creature has been a soldier.

* Add the trait "***Military Training.*** The sargeant has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the soldier's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated."

* Add the Reaction "***Parry.*** The sargeant adds their Proficiency Bonus to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the sargeant must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon."

* If the creature already has the action Multiattack, add another attack to the Multiattack and add the text "The sargeant can use its Battle Command action in place of one of its attacks." If the creature does not have Multiattack, add the action ***Multiattack.*** The sargeant can make two attacks. The sargeant can use its Battle Command action in place of one of its attacks."

* Add the bonus action "***Battle Command.*** Choose one creature within 30 feet of the sargeant that the sargeant can see. If the chosen creature can see or hear the sargeant, that creature can use its reaction to make one melee attack or to take the Dodge or Hide action."
