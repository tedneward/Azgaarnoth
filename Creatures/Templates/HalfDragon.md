# Half-Dragon Template
A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-dragon. 

***Transformation.*** When a creature becomes a half-dragon, it retains all its statistics except as noted below.

First, the draconic parentage of the half-dragon must be determined:

Type           | Energy    | Area
-------------- | --------- | -------------
Black, Copper  | Acid      | 100-foot line that is 10 feet wide
Blue, Bronze   | Lightning | 
Brass,Gold,Red | Fire      | 
Green          | Poison    | 
White, Silver  | Cold      | 

* **Challenge.** To avoid recalculating the creature's challenge rating, apply the template only to a creature that meets the optional prerequisite in the Breath Weapon table below. Otherwise, use the guidelines in the Dungeon Master's Guide to recalculate the rating after you apply the template.

* **Senses.** The half-dragon gains blindsight with a radius of 10 feet and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.

* **Resistances.** The half-dragon gains resistance to a type of damage based on its color.

* **Languages.** The half-dragon speaks Draconic in addition to any other languages it knows.

* Add new action; the half-dragon's size and color determines how this action functions:

    * Black,Copper/Large or smaller: ***Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The half-dragon exhales acid in a 15-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
