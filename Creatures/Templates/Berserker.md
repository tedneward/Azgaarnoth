# Berserker Template

Add 2 - 5 more hit dice to standard creature

**Reckless**: At the start of its turn, the berserker can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

If added 3 - 5 hit dice, add ***Multiattack.***
