## Template: Berserker
Certain creatures go into a frenzy when they enter combat.

***Transformation.*** The creature retains all of its previous characteristics.

* Add 2 - 5 more hit dice to standard creature

* Add trait: "***Reckless.*** At the start of its turn, the berserker can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn."

* If 3 - 5 hit dice were added and the creature does not already have it, add action "***Multiattack.*** The berserker can make two attacks." If 3 - 5 hit dice were added and the creature does already have Multiattack, add one more attack.
