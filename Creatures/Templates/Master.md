## Template: Master
A master is a creature that has become an example for lesser members of its kind, typically through extensive training or magical enhancement. They are braver, stronger and more perceptive than their inferiors, and the presence of a master can be a great boon to morale.

### Prerequisite
Any aberration, celestial, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, giant, humanoid, monstrosity or undead with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher.

### Statistics
**Hit Dice.** Increase the master's hit dice by 4.

**Abilities.** Increase each of the master's ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 20, unless the base creature already had an ability score of 20 or higher.

**Languages.** The master gains any one language. If the base creature cannot speak, the master cannot speak this language, but can understand it.

**Skills.** The master gains proficiency in Perception and two other skills.

### Traits
***Brave.*** The master has advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

***Brute.*** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the master hits with it.

(must be able to hear, see, or smell; respectively): ***Keen Hearing, Sight, or Smell.*** The master has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing, sight, or smell. The master can only choose one option.

***Spellcasting.*** If the master has a spellcasting feature that draws on a class spell list, it counts as being two levels higher in that class for the purposes of spell slots and prepared spells.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** If the base creature does not have multiattack, the master may make two weapon attacks. If the base creature has multiattack, the master may make an additional weapon attack.

(must be able to speak): ***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the master can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the master. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the master is incapacitated.

### Reactions
***Parry.*** The master adds its proficiency modifier to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the master must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## CR Calculation
Recalculate the creature's CR with the following considerations:

* Increased hit points (from improved hit dice).
* Increase effective AC by 1 (from Parry).
* Increase effective damage per-round damage by the amount listed in the trait (from Brute and Multiattack).
