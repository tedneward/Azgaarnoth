# Creature Template: Corrupted Creatures
When a creature gets too close to the corrupting influence of demons and the Abyss, they become corrupted, their body being warped and twisted by the influence of evil and chaos.

***Transformation.*** When a creature becomes corrupted, it retains its statistics except as described below. The corrupted creature might retain or lose any or all of its lair actions, abilities, and traits or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit.

* **Alignment.** Corruptions are Chaotic Evil.
* **Armor Class.** Demonic flesh and ichor begins covering the body, forming horns and tough, strange skin. The corruption gains a +2 to their Armor Class.
* **Hit Points.** A corruption gains an unnatural constitution, a fiendish vigor beating through it's veins. The corruption gains 2 additional Hit Die.
* **Damage Resistances.** The corruption gains resistance to fire, cold, and lightning damage. If it is already resistant or immune to one of those elements, it becomes immune to it.
* **Challenge Rating.** Typically a corruption's Challenge Rating is increased by 1. Some creatures may increase by more than 1 or not increase at all.
* **Fiendish End.** Every corruption belongs to the Abyss and when it reaches its end, it is drawn back to the Abyss. When a corruption is dropped to 0 Hit Points, they explode out in fiendish fire, damaging nearby creatures, this effect is centered on them. Consult the chart below for it's range and damage per the corruption's CR. Affected creatures must succeed a Constitution saving throw, the DC is 8 + corrupted creature's Constitution modifier + corrupted creature's Proficiency Bonus. On a successful save, they take half damage.
* If the corrupted creature is Large or larger, add trait ***Fiendish Reach.*** The creature is horrifying to behold thanks to its unnatural limbs and springy bones. The creature's normal reach is increased by 5 feet.
