# "Alpha" Template
For those creatures that run in packs (dogs, wolves, etc), there is often one that leads the pack. Commonly referred to as an "alpha", it inevitably has better statistics than the rest of the pack.

***Transformation.***

* The alpha has above average (7 or 8 per Hit Die) hit points.

* Add 2 to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

* Add 1 to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.

* It may have additional traits, actions, or other features as determined by the DM.
