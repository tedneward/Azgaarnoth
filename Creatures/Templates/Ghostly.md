# Creature Template: Ghostly
A ghostly creature is sometimes created when a powerful creature is killed and a great wrong is done to it. The creature can only be laid to rest by setting right whatever wrong caused it to appear.

When a creature becomes a ghostly creature, it retains its statistics, except as described below. The creature loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The creature retains none of its lair actions, but retains all of its legendary actions.

**Type.** The creature's type changes from creature to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Speed.** The creature retains it speeds, gains flight 30ft if it did not have it before, and can hover.

**Damage Resistances.** The creature gains resistance to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons.

**Damage Immunities.** The creature gains immunity to cold, necrotic, and poison damage. It also retains any immunities that it had in life.

**Condition Immunities.** The creature gains immunity to the charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, and restrained conditions. It also doesn't suffer from exhaustion.

**Special Abilities.** The creature loses all supernatural and spell-like abilities that it possessed in life.

**Damage Type.** The creature's physical melee or ranged attacks deal necrotic damage rather than the damage type they dealt before.

**New Trait: Ethereal Sight.** The creature can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

**New Trait: Incorporeal Movement.** The creature can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**New Trait: Rejuvenation.** If the creature is destroyed, it reappears in its lair 2d4 days later with all its hit points. The only way to completely be rid of the creature is to determine the reason for its existence and resolve the issue.

**New Action: Etherealness.** The creature enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
