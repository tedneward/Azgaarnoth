## Templates: Knight
Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment (and the general alignment of the pledge itself) determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are commoners, and is typically outfitted with the best equipment the ruler, religious order, or noble cause can buy.

* Add the trait "***Strength in numbers.*** The knight has advantage on attack rolls against an enemy if at least one of the knight's allies is within 5 feet of the enemy and the ally isn't incapacitated."

* Add the Reaction "***Parry.*** The knight adds their Proficiency Bonus to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon."

* If 5 Hit Dice were added, add "***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the knight can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the creature. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the creature is incapacitated."
