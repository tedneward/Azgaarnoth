# Knight Template
Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment (and the general alignment of the pledge itself) determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are commoners, and is typically outfitted with the best equipment the ruler, religious order, or noble cause can buy.

***Transformation.***

* Add 3 to 6 more Hit Dice to the base creature.

* Add ***Pack Tactics.*** The knight has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the knight's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

* Add ***Strength in numbers.*** The knight has advantage on attack rolls against an enemy if at least one of the creatures allies is within 5 feet of the enemy and the ally isn't incapacitated.

* If 5 Hit Dice were added, add ***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the creature can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the creature. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the creature is incapacitated.
