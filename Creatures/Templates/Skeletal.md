# Creature Template: Skeletal
Skeletal creatures are created through spells such as [animate dead](../Magic/Spells/animate-dead.md). Such a creature has no memory of its former life or self, and functions identically to any other skeleton, though it may retain some of its abilities or features. 

When a creature becomes a skeletal creature, it retains its statistics, except as described below. The creature loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The creature retains none of its lair actions or legendary actions.

**Type.** The creature's type changes from creature to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep. 

**Speed.** The creature loses its flying speed and its swimming speed, if it had one.

**Armor Class.** Modify the creature's Armor Class by applying a -4 penalty. Much of the creature's protective armor has rotten or sloughed away.

**Damage Vulnerabilities.** The creature gains vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.

**Damage Immunities.** The creature gains immunity to poison damage. It also retains all immunities that it had in life.

**Condition Immunities.** The creature gains immunity to the poisoned condition, and retains any immunities it had in life. It also doesn't suffer from exhaustion.

**Special Abilities.** The creature loses all supernatural and spell-like abilities that it possessed in life.

**Skills.** The creature loses all skill proficiencies.

**Creature Feats.** The creature loses all feats that it had taken in life.
