# Creature: White Dragon

## White Dragon [Feats](DraconicFeats.md)

### Freeze
*Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.*

If a creature takes cold damage from the dragon, its speeds are reduced by half until the end of its next turn.


### Freezing Fog
*Prerequisite: must be Old or older.*

The dragon gains the following action option:

**Freezing Fog (3/Day).** The dragon summons a fog cloud as if it had cast the [fog cloud]() spell. If a creature starts its turn in the fog or moves there for the first time on its turn, each of its speeds are reduced by half. In addition, the ground beneath the fog is coated in a layer of ice (with effects as if cast with a grease spell). The dragon is immune to all of these effects.


### Frostbite
*Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.*

A creature that takes cold damage from the dragon takes 4 (1d8) cold damage at the beginning of each of its turns until it succeeds on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, which it can attempt at the end of each of its turns.

### Frozen Demise
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

Any creature that is reduced to 0 hit points as a result of taking cold damage from the dragon is killed instantly and becomes a frozen statue until thawed.


### Hypothermic Cold
The dragon's attacks ignore resistance to cold damage. When the dragon rolls cold damage, it can treat any 1 rolled on a damage die as a 2.


### Ice Aura
*Prerequisite: must be Old or older.*

Each creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of the dragon or moves there for the first time on its turn takes 9 (2d8) cold damage.


### Light Resistance
The dragon has advantage on saving throws against bright lights that cause blindness, and advantage on saving throws to end that blindness. The dragon is also resistant to radiant damage.


### Savage Nature
*Prerequisite: must be Juvenile or older.*

The dragon rolls critical hits on rolls of 19 and 20 on the d20. Once per turn, it may reroll a damage die and take either total. 


### Snow Dragon
The dragon has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy or icy terrain.
