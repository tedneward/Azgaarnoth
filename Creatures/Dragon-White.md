# Creature: White Dragon
Among chromatic dragons, white dragons have the reputation for being the stupidest or most animalistic. Perhaps that is true, but most adventurers make the mistake of assuming that means all white dragons are stupid. This is not true. They are more bestial than their cousins, to be sure, but they are still dragons and quite intelligent. They simply prefer not to scheme or rely on intellect. They live on their strength and on their instincts. They also have obscenely long memories, and have been known to hold grudges for hundreds of years.

## Diet
White Dragons don't have much preference when it comes to food, as long as it's meat. They like bigger animals if they can get them, but they will kill and eat whatever is available. This includes sentient life. They prefer their food frozen, and will keep it in snowbanks or ice for days or weeks at a time before eating it.

## Lairs
As with most other dragons, the whites prefer large caves of some variety. In places where the climate allows, they will find or carve enormous caves of ice and snow out of glaciers, reinforcing the structures with their icy breath.

## Tactics
White dragons lack the maliciousness of the black dragons or the ferocity of the reds, and they lack the green dragons' desire and ability to manipulate intruders. Even so, they are remarkably effective hunters. They kill quickly and efficiently. This also makes it nigh impossible to negotiate with them, as they tend to kill first, eat second, and never bother to ask questions. The only offers that adventurers have used to successfully get out alive are those involving promises of sparkling diamonds or (even better) even more meat than the humanoid would provide.

A white dragon prefers to attack savagely with tooth and claw, but it's not stupid. It won't participate in a battle where it is obviously outmatched; at least not directly. In these situations a white dragon will most often perch in hard-to-reach places where it can barrage foes with its icy breath.

## Favored Treasure
White dragons love treasure that glitters like ice, such as diamonds or other similar gems. They also love silver or platinum, and mirrors or other reflective objects.

## Physical Characteristics
White dragons have serrated claws to help them walk on ice, and protective layers of eyelids to protect their eyes from light and snow. They have a dry odor, which is more a lack of smell in its own right.

## Terrain and Habitat
Whites love the cold and prefer to live in frozen mountains, tundra, or glacial plains in year-round snow and ice. However, some of them are not so fortunate, and must live where they can. Some have been known to lair in mountains or forests, but this can be dangerous for them because they often come into conflict with other dragons in these areas. They tend to avoid these conflicts because: 1) dragons of other varieties are generally stronger than whites of the same age; and 2) whites hate expending energy if the end result is not food.

## White Dragon [Feats](DraconicFeats.md)
The following feats can only be taken by white dragons.

### Freeze
*Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.*

If a creature takes cold damage from the dragon, its speeds are reduced by half until the end of its next turn.

### Freezing Fog
*Prerequisite: must be Old or older.*

The dragon gains the following action option:

**Freezing Fog (3/Day).** The dragon summons a fog cloud as if it had cast the [fog cloud]() spell. If a creature starts its turn in the fog or moves there for the first time on its turn, each of its speeds are reduced by half. In addition, the ground beneath the fog is coated in a layer of ice (with effects as if cast with a grease spell). The dragon is immune to all of these effects.

### Frostbite
*Prerequisite: must be Adult or older.*

A creature that takes cold damage from the dragon takes 4 (1d8) cold damage at the beginning of each of its turns until it succeeds on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, which it can attempt at the end of each of its turns.

### Frozen Demise
*Prerequisite: must be Mature Adult or older.*

Any creature that is reduced to 0 hit points as a result of taking cold damage from the dragon is killed instantly and becomes a frozen statue until thawed.

### Hypothermic Cold
The dragon's attacks ignore resistance to cold damage. When the dragon rolls cold damage, it can treat any 1 rolled on a damage die as a 2.

### Ice Aura
*Prerequisite: must be Old or older.*

Each creature that begins its turn within 10 feet of the dragon or moves there for the first time on its turn takes 9 (2d8) cold damage.

### Light Resistance
The dragon has advantage on saving throws against bright lights that cause blindness, and advantage on saving throws to end that blindness. The dragon is also resistant to radiant damage.

### Savage Nature
*Prerequisite: must be Juvenile or older.*

The dragon rolls critical hits on rolls of 19 and 20 on the d20. Once per turn, it may reroll a damage die and take either total. 

### Snow Dragon
The dragon has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy or icy terrain.

**Ice Walk.** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra moment.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

#### Actions
**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) cold damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales an icy blast of hail in a 100-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw, taking 81 (18d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Legendary Actions

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
