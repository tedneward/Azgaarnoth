## Dracohybrid Charger
Covered in thick, bony plates, dracohybrid chargers crash into anything they perceive as dangerous and don't stop until the threat is completely destroyed. The dracohybrid's strange internal organs generate a weak electric field around its body which is normally unnoticeable, but those affected by the dragon's curse feel a tingling sensation when they stand near the charger, which builds slowly until it becomes a powerful shock.

>***Charge.*** If the dracohybrid moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

>***Charger's Curse.*** A creature with a dragon's curse within 30 feet of the dracohybrid takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage at the start of each of the dracohybrid's turns.

>***Dragon's Curse.*** The dracohybrid targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be cursed for 1 minute with a dragon's curse. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Dragon's Curse of all dracohybrids for the next 24 hours.
