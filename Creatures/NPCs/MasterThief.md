## Master Thief
Master thieves are known for perpetrating daring heists. They tend to develop a romanticized reputation. A master thief might "retire" from hands-on work to run a thieves' guild, spearhead some covert enterprise, or enjoy a quiet life of luxury.

When a master thief completes a challenging heist, they often leave behind a calling card to taunt their victims. You may roll on the Master Thief Calling Cards table to determine what a master thief leaves behind.
