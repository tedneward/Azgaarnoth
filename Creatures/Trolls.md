# Trolls
Trolls that are nearly obliterated but survive and regenerate from mere scraps of flesh can display bizarre features. Radically transformed trolls like the rot trolls, spirit trolls, and venom trolls that follow are especially likely to arise when trolls regenerate in the presence of magical emanations, planar energy, disease, or death on a vast scale, or if their bodies were damaged by elemental forces. These unusual forms can also be produced and shaped by the ritual magic of evil spellcasters or by trolls' own practices, as is the case for dire trolls.

***Vaprak the Destroyer.*** Although trolls are rarely devout and seldom ponder spiritual questions, some fear and venerate the entity known as Vaprak the Destroyer. Vaprak's true nature is something of a mystery, but Vaprak is always portrayed as a horrid, misshapen, greenish creature strongly resembling a troll. Vaprak is given to fits of mindless destruction and uncontrollably fears the plots and ambitions of other deities.Vaprak's troll worshipers believe this god devours the souls of those who have been cooked or digested (slain by fire or acid). Otherwise, the god spits the soul back into the world to regenerate a new body.

## Dire Troll
Trolls kill and eat almost anything--including, in rare cases, other trolls. This cannibalism has the effect of causing a troll to grow to an unusually large size. The resulting dire trolls crave more and more troll flesh to fuel their continued growth.

Dire trolls also increase their size by grafting flesh onto themselves. When a slab of quivering troll flesh is bound against a fresh wound on a dire troll, the dire troll's regenerative capacity incorporates the new mass into the troll's own musculature. Even more horrifying are the multiple arms, eyes, claws, and organs that dire trolls tear from their victims and graft onto themselves in this manner.

## Rot Troll
A troll infused with waves of necrotic energy as it regenerates can develop a symbiotic relationship with that deathly power. The troll's body withers, and the flesh falls away from the body as quickly as it forms. Eventually a rot troll becomes unable to regenerate, though the troll still heals normally. The creature courses with necrotic energy; simply standing near a rot troll exposes other creatures to lethal emanations.

## Spirit Troll
A troll blasted with psychic energy can take a nonphysical form upon regenerating. The troll's psyche survives, but the body is as insubstantial as shadow. The troll might be unaware of the transition--the creature still moves and attacks with teeth and claws as ever--but now the troll strikes at victims' minds.

## Venom Troll
A troll that survives massive doses of poison might transform into a venom troll. Lingering poison infuses the troll's blood and tissue, and poison leaks from the pores to coat the troll's fangs and claws. These creatures are especially dangerous in close combat because poison drips off their flesh and sprays out from every wound they receive.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
