**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

#### Actions
**Life Drain.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 (4d8 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Create Specter.** The wraith targets a humanoid within 10 feet of it that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute and died violently. The target's spirit rises as a [specter](Specter.md) in the space of its corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. The [specter](Specter.md) is under the wraith's control. The wraith can have no more than seven [specter](Specter.md) under its control at one time.
