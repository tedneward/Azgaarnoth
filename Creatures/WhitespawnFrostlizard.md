## Actions
**Charge**. If the whitespawn frostlizard moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 14 (2d8 +5) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is an object or structure (wall, etc) then the frostlizard gains advantage on the attack and damage rolls.

**Gore**. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage.

**Frost cloud (Recharge 5-6)**. The whitespawn frostlizard blows a cloud of frost in a 30-foot cloud that is 15 feet by 15 feet. Each creature in that cloud must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
