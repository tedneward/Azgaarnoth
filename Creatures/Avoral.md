> With unmatched eyesight, the avoral are the perfect scouts for the guardinals. Their great skill at flying, mixed with excellent spellcasting, make them revered wherever they go. Rarely found alone, those that are alone are typically on an important mission, otherwise, they’re generally found in the company of other guardinals.
