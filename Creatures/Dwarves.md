# Dwarves
Dwarf commoners are hardy folk, usually working as miners, metalworkers, or some other skilled profession. Dwarves usually trained in some form of weaponry, so they're likely to fight if antagonized.

***Cousins of the Underdark.*** The [duergar](Duergar.md) are genetically of the same lineage as other dwarves, but their time as captives of the mind flayers has rendered them almost genetically and culturally incompatible with their other dwarven kin. Likewise, the [derro](Derro.md), actually closer kin to [gnomes](Gnomes.md) than dwarves, are so startingly different from their mountain and hill dwarf cousins that neither side much considers the other to be a "true dwarf" anymore.

***TODO.*** Draw up a Hill Dwarf Merchant, a Mountain Dwarf Mercenary (Veteran), and a Hill Dwarf Exiled Noble.

## Hill Dwarf
Hill dwarves were those dwarves who, during the time of the Eldar, lived either above-ground or in homes that were partly above-, partly below-, the surface. They often served as the go-betweens among those on the surface (Eldar, humans, elves, and others) and those underground (most of all the mountain dwarves).

After the Exodus, hill dwarf and mountain dwarf were often standing side by side, and as their clans intermarried, any genetic differences slowly faded. Today, it is to the point where even most dwarves can't tell the two apart.

## Mountain Dwarf
Mountain dwarves were those dwarves who, during the time of the Eldar, lived below ground almost entirely. Fantastic miners and smiths, the mountain dwarves built the Seventeen Cities (often with help from earth elementals and other earth-friendly creatures), fashioned wondrous items of arcane power, and thrived in the Underdark. Numerically, they outnumbered their hill dwarf cousins by two or three to one, and were at times somewhat disparaging of their surface-friendly kin.

With the coming of the Hordes, mountain dwarves formed the majority of the defense underground, but much of the fighting remained on the surface, so their martial skills were not truly tested. It was not until lthe Fall of the Eldar that the Hordes discovered the vast Underdark, and before long the mountain dwarves' might was tested--and often found wanting. One by one, the Seventeen Cities fell to the larger numbers of the Hordes, in a time known to the dwarves simply as "the Exodus".

After the Exodus, hill dwarf and mountain dwarf were often standing side by side, and as their clans intermarried, any genetic differences slowly faded. Today, it is to the point where even most dwarves can't tell the two apart.
