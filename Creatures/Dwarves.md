# Dwarves
Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges... these all used to characterize the dwarves, twins to the elves as the Firstborn of the Eldar. While their surroundings and activities have grown since--just as many dwarves are merchants as there are miners--some things continue to hold true for dwarves: a commitment to clan, a preference for tradition, and a burning hatred of those that would threaten either.

Dwarves are hardy folk, often usually working in skilled professions. Some have taken up more agrarian roots, choosing to embrace the world of sun and rain, but many dwarves find themselves naturally drawn to lives of practiced skills. Take careful note, though: despite their history, dwarves are just as fond of scroll and pen as they are crossbow and axe. Traditions hold among the dwarven clans, one of those being martial exercise, so most dwarves are trained in some form of weaponry, and likely to fight if antagonized.

***Short and Stout.***
Bold and hardy, dwarves are stereotypically known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.

Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.

***Long Memory, Long Grudges.*** Dwarves can live to be more than 100 years old, but their traditions encompass a rich appreciation for history and scholarly study of the past. Through this rich and extensive study of the past, dwarves often "remember" a very different world. Many dwarven clans even have magical artifacts that allow them to speak with ancient ancestors, to understand history even more fully, particularly that of the time before the Exodus, which weighs heavily on the dwarven clans. This perspective of longevity grants them a view of the world that other races such as humans and halflings lack.

Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.

Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.

***Clans and Kingdoms.*** Dwarven kingdoms stretched deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mined gems and precious metals and forged items of wonder; sadly, for many dwarves, the Exodus robbed them of their ancestral homes. Other cities continue to live and thrive underground, but always the dwarves lament the loss of the Seventeen Cities. They have always had a love for the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. Many mountain and hill dwarves dislike boats (though a surprising number of dwarves in recent generations have taken to them quite fondly), so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.

The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf. After the Exodus, however, clan and guild began to intertwine, and today a dwarf who is exiled from clan can find a home in a guild, and a dwarf fired from a guild will often find a willing clan to adopt them.

Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.

***Cousins of the Underdark.*** The [duergar](Duergar.md) are genetically of the same lineage as other dwarves, but their time as captives of the mind flayers has rendered them almost genetically and culturally incompatible with their other dwarven kin. Likewise, the [derro](Derro.md), actually closer kin to [gnomes](Gnomes.md) than dwarves, are so startingly different from their mountain and hill dwarf cousins that neither side much considers the other to be a "true dwarf" anymore.

***TODO.*** Draw up a Hill Dwarf Merchant, a Mountain Dwarf Mercenary (Veteran), and a Hill Dwarf Exiled Noble.

### Dwarf Names
A dwarf's name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf's name belongs to the clan, not to the individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name, and while some clans or guilds forbid that dwarf to take a dwarven name in its place, usually there is another clan or guild willing to offer redemption. Certain names are held reverent within a clan or guild, however, and use of that name by someone outside the clan or guild is likely to draw ire, if not blood.

**Male Names:** Adrik, Alberich, Baern, Barendd, Brottor, Bruenor, Dain, Darrak, Delg, Eberk, Einkil, Fargrim, Flint, Gardain, Harbek, Kildrak, Morgran, Orsik, Oskar, Rangrim, Rurik, Taklinn, Thoradin, Thorin, Tordek, Traubon, Travok, Ulfgar, Veit, Vondal

## Hill Dwarf
Hill dwarves were those dwarves who, during the time of the Eldar, lived either above-ground or in homes that were partly above-, partly below-, the surface. They often served as the go-betweens among those on the surface (Eldar, humans, elves, and others) and those underground (most of all the mountain dwarves).

After the Exodus, hill dwarf and mountain dwarf were often standing side by side, and as their clans intermarried, any genetic differences slowly faded. Today, it is to the point where even most dwarves can't tell the two apart.

## Hill Dwarf Merchant Guild Master
Nothing epitomizes the modern dwarf more than the Master of a [Merchant Guild](../Organizations/MerchantGuilds/index.md). Whether overseeing a guild stretching across a meager half-dozen cities, providing niche goods and barely scraping by, or a seamaster operating his ship as an independent transport guild, or an overseer of a continent-spanning network of factors and trade routes, the dwarven traditions of clan (extended here to the guild) continue to hold strong.

## Mountain Dwarf
Mountain dwarves were those dwarves who, during the time of the Eldar, lived below ground almost entirely. Fantastic miners and smiths, the mountain dwarves built the Seventeen Cities (often with help from earth elementals and other earth-friendly creatures), fashioned wondrous items of arcane power, and thrived in the Underdark. Numerically, they outnumbered their hill dwarf cousins by two or three to one, and were at times somewhat disparaging of their surface-friendly kin.

With the coming of the Hordes, mountain dwarves formed the majority of the defense underground, but much of the fighting remained on the surface, so their martial skills were not truly tested. It was not until lthe Fall of the Eldar that the Hordes discovered the vast Underdark, and before long the mountain dwarves' might was tested--and often found wanting. One by one, the Seventeen Cities fell to the larger numbers of the Hordes, in a time known to the dwarves simply as "the Exodus".

After the Exodus, hill dwarf and mountain dwarf were often standing side by side, and as their clans intermarried, any genetic differences slowly faded. Today, it is to the point where even most dwarves can't tell the two apart.
