# Goblin
Goblins are small, black-hearted, selfish humanoids that lair in caves, abandoned mines, despoiled dungeons, and other dismal settings. Individually weak, goblins gather in large — sometimes overwhelming — numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.

**Goblinoids.** Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, [hobgoblins](Hobgoblin.md) and [bugbears](Bugbear.md), like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.

**Malicious Glee.** Motivated by greed and malice, goblins can’t help but celebrate the few times they have the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer joy when victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace all manner of wickedness.

**Leaders and Followers.** Goblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribe’s survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs.

**Challenging Lairs.** Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can’t navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies.

**Rat Keepers and Wolf Riders.** Goblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.

**Worshipers of Maglubiyet.** [Maglubiyet the Mighty One](/Religions/Pantheon/Maglubiyet.md), the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet’s army on the plane of Acheron. This is a "privilege" that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One’s eternal tyranny even more than death.

## Worg Rider
*Small humanoid (goblinoid), neutral evil*

**Armor Class** 15 (Studded Leather Armor + dex bonus) 

**Hit Points** 27 (6d6 + 6)

**Speed** 30 ft (on foot), 50 ft (mounted on worg)

**STR**|**DEX**|**CON**|**INT**|**WIS**|**CHA**

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11

**Languages** Common, Goblin

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP)

**Keen Hearing and Sight**. The worg rider has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight.

**One Mind.** The worg rider and its mount act on the same initiative count while mounted.

**Nimble Escape.** The worg rider can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns, and do so for both itself and its mount.

**Mobile.** Goblin Worg Riders are particularly speedy and agile. While mounted, they gain the following benefits:

* When they use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn't cost them extra movement on that turn.
* When they make a melee attack against a creature, they don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn, whether they hit or not. (Worg Riders will instinctively and deliberately time their move/attack combos to single out a creature, attack, and nip away before a return attack can come.)

#### Actions
**Multiattack.** The worg rider makes two melee attacks or two ranged attacks.

**Scimitar.** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

**Shortbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. Worg riders can fire while mounted without penalty.

#### Description
Those goblins who are selected to ride the powerful goblinoid-wolves known as [Worgs](Worg.md) are tougher, faster, and meaner than their on-foot cousins. Worg Riders are feared among the goblins, and many a Worg Rider has gone on to become a Boss in their own right later in life. A Worg Rider bonds with its Worg, and the pair are inseparable for their (admittedly brief) lives.

Some Goblin Worg Riders have learned to ride [Dire Wolves](DireWolf.md) or [Hell Hounds](HellHound.md) instead; those goblins are generally considered insane by their fellows, and live in expectation of an even shorter lifespan.

**Nimble Escape.** The goblin can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

#### Actions
**Multiattack.** The goblin makes two attacks with its scimitar. The second attack has disadvantage.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

**Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d6) piercing damage.

#### Reactions
**Redirect Attack.** When a creature the goblin can see targets it with an attack, the goblin chooses another goblin within 5 feet of it. The two goblins swap places, and the chosen goblin becomes the target instead.
