# Lycanthropy in Azgaarnoth

Lycanthropy, in which a creature has the ability to transform into a savage creature of the wild, is a rare condition found in Azgaarnoth. There are several variants of the condition; one is a transmissible magical disease in which the lycanthrope lacks conscious control over both the time of transformation and their actions after the transformation, while the other is a natural condition passed genetically from parent to child, in which control over the transformation is stronger, but not perfect, as is control over the creature's actions while transformed. Those infected by the transmissible disease, if they have children (as either parent), they then pass it on, who gain some measure of control. However, it is not uncommon for those parents who lack any control to then seek to destroy their children out of jealousy.
