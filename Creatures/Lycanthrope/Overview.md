# Lycanthropy in Azgaarnoth

Lycanthropy, in which a creature has the ability to transform into a savage creature of the wild, is a rare condition found in Azgaarnoth. There are several variants of the condition; one is a transmissible magical disease in which the lycanthrope lacks conscious control over both the time of transformation and their actions after the transformation, while the other is a natural condition passed genetically from parent to child, in which control over the transformation is stronger, but not perfect, as is control over the creature's actions while transformed.
