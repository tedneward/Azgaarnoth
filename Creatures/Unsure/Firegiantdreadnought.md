## Fire Giant Dreadnought
Most fire giants value not just strength but also skill at forgecraft. The foundry is the heart of any fire giant community. It is a temple, school, proving ground, and political hub rolled into one.

Those whose primary virtue is brawn are usually consigned to the lowliest of tasks, such as working forge bellows or moving coal. However, the strongest among these can excel at and gain rank through a specialized role: the dreadnought.

Dreadnoughts are massively powerful fire giants who wield two huge shields like plow blades. These shields bear spikes on their exterior and have hollow interiors into which the dreadnought pours hot coals at the first sign of danger. Armed with these two shields, the dreadnought can present a fiery wall to any attacker. When the dreadnought has finished, often all that is left of a foe is a smoking smear on the floor.

When not called on to fight, dreadnoughts maintain their strength by using their shields to shove huge quantities of coal, stone, or ore about the foundry. Occasionally, dreadnoughts are called on by their superiors to accompany a war or diplomatic delegation and use their fierce and intimidating demeanor to strengthen the delegation's position.
