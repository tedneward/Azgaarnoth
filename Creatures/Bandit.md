# Bandit
Bandits rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.

**Parry.** The leader adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the leader must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

#### Description
It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The bandit leader has these qualities in spades. More than treasure, a bandit leader craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the leader’s vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the leader’s colorful reputation.
