>***Charger.*** If the render moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with its claws on the same turn, the target takes an extra 4 (1d6) slashing damage. For each 10 feet of length added to the charge (max of 30 feet) add an additional 4 (1d6) slashing damage to the attack (max 3d6).
>
>***Grappler.*** If the target has already been hit by a claw attack this round, the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the render can't use its claws on another target.
>
>***Keen Sight and Smell.*** The render has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.
>
>***Savage Attack.*** Once per turn the DM rerolls the render's damage dice and takes the highest result.
>
>#### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The render makes two claw attacks. It can choose to grapple a target that it has successfully hit with its claws.
>
>***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., Hit: 19 (4d8 + 5) slashing damage.
>
>***Rend.*** The gray render tears a creature it has grappled, dealing 43 (8d10 + 5) slashing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw (disadvantage on a critical hit) or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target receives healing magic. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
