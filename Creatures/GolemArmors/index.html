<h1 id="golem-armors">Golem Armors</h1>
<p>Golem armors are special constructs designed to be controlled using magic by a humanoid pilot inside the armor itself. These constructs are usually conjured as part of the <a href="../../Magic/Spells/golem-armor/">golem armor</a> spell but rumors tell of permanent golem armors that can be made via lengthy magical rituals.</p>
<p>Ancient legends tell of the Eldar using these giant armors as the vanguard of magical armies. Most of them are thirty feet tall but those same legends suggest the Eldar had armors that could touch the clouds.</p>

<p><strong><em>Operated By Magic.</em></strong> Golem armors are designed to be operated by magic. A spellcaster near an empty golem armor can force it to open the hidden door in its chest and kneel to allow entry. Once inside, the mage stays in a shielded core, protected from the heat, cold, lightning, or other threats posed by the golem. This controller (sometimes called a pilot) can use any talent for magic they might possess to control the armor. As examples, a wizard would use their intellect, a druid or cleric would use their spirit, and not only sorcerers but even tieflings or anyone else with natural magic could use that same natural talent to control the armor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Constructed Nature.</em></strong> A golem armor doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
