## Blink Dog
![](Dog-Blink.png)

A blink dog takes its name from its ability to blink in and out of existence, a talent it uses to aid its attacks and to avoid harm. Blink dogs harbor a long-standing hatred for displacer beasts and attack them on sight.

## Death Dog
![](Dog-Death.png)

A death dog is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains, deserts, and the Underdark. Hate burns in a death dog's heart, and a taste for humanoid flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva carries a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot off the bone.

## Giant Hyena
The giant hyena is often the leader of a pack of normal-sized hyenas, though periodically a pride of giant hyenas have been spotted in the wild. They are fearsome hunters and fiendish packs, and their hooting calls are often heard as laughter that sets their victims' fears ablaze.

## Hell Hound
Monstrous, fire-breathing fiends that take the form of powerful dogs, hell hounds are found on the battlefields of Acheron and throughout the Lower Planes. On the Material Plane, hell hounds are most commonly seen in service to devils, fire giants, and other evil creatures that use them as guard animals and companions.

***Burning Hunger.*** Hell hounds hunt in packs, feeding on any creature that appears edible. They avoid potentially dangerous foes in favor of targeting the weakest prey with their savage bite and fiery breath, demonstrating a relentless determination as they pursue that prey to the bitter end.

When hell hounds feed, the flesh they consume stokes the infernal fires that burn within them. When a hell hound dies, that fire consumes the creature's remains in a billowing eruption of smoke and blazing embers, leaving nothing behind but scorched tufts of black fur.

***Evil to the Core.*** Hell hounds are smarter than mundane beasts, and their lawful nature makes them good at following orders. However, a hell hound's evil disposition means that the creature can't be trained to be anything other than a ruthless killer. If a hell hound isn't allowed to indulge its malevolent hunger, it quickly abandons or turns against its master.

## Hyena
Hyenas, a distant canine cousin of the domesticated dog or the wild pack-forming wolf, roam the grasslands of the [Al'Uma](../Geography/AlUma.md) and [Yithia](../Geography/Yithia.md) freely, and only slightly less often than they do the more remote areas of [Liria](../Geography/Liria.md) and [Tragekia](../Geography/Tragekia.md). Individually, they often aren't much trouble, and will not seek to attack a well-armed or numerous adversary, but when hyenas are in a pack, and they spot a lone individual away from the others, they can fiercely swarm and devour in seconds.

## Jackal
Another distant canine relative, jackals are carrion-feeders, and will generally wait until a predator is done with their kill before swarming over the carcass. If attacked, they will generally flee, unless young are present, at which time they will fight to the death to protect the young.
