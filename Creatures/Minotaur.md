## Minotaur
A minotaur's roar is a savage battle cry that most civilized creatures fear. When the Hordes descended upon Azgaarnoth, minotaurs were at the front of the lines, hewing through Firstborn and human alike with glee.

Over time, as more and more of the Hordish clans and tribes began to settle into Azgaarnothian territory, more and more of the minotaurs began to question the exercise and their presence within it: Was their purpose really to just die in battle so that orcs or hobgoblins could raise banners over blasted lands? Certainly, honor in battle was to be sought, but must it always be on others' terms? It is perhaps not surprising that it was minotaurs who started to look for ways to eke out different kinds of existence from the traditional Hordish ways, and that it was a minotaur that would eventually found the [Principality of Yithi](../Nations/Yithi.md).

Today, minotaurs can be found all over Azgaarnoth, often still working as individuals, and often still seeking honor and glory through battle and combat, but much of the time, they do so either to the ends of their employes (as part of a [mercenary company](../Organizations/MercCompanies/index.md)) or to the roar of the crowd (as a champion in a [dueling college](../Organizations/DuelingColleges/index.md)) or even with the sea spray in their hair as they chase down fleeing ships.

***Playable Race: Fear the Roar.*** [Minotaur](../Races/Minotaurs.md) characters often find that their strength and size lend well to martial classes, particularly barbarians or rangers; for the same reasons, they tend to shy away from roguish ones. Arcane-minded minotaurs often find themselves drawn to druidic, sorcerous, or shamanic professions. Few minotaurs have the time and patience for artifice or wizardry.
