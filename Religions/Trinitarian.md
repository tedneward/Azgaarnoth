# The Trinitarian Church
A splinter faction of the Kaevarian Church, the Trinitarians believe in a triune god over all things--that, in essence, Kaevar manifests in three forms (Sor, Dara, and Leriya), each with their own distinct name, each with their own distinct domains, and each working simultaneously in concert and opposition with one another.

The theology of the Trinitarians is something of a strange one, and scholars have never been able to pin precisely where in the theological discussions the "splintering" occurred; Trinitarians have been around as long--some say longer--than the Kaevarian Church itself, and their origins are lost to time. Tritinarian doctrine, however, has been remarkably consistent and constant across the eight (or more) millennia of its existence.

In essence, Trinitarian doctrine holds that all divine power (Kaevar, for example) is actually manifested in three beings: Sor, the Father; Dara, the Mother; and Leriya, the Lover. All three are said to have existed since the dawn of time, and that all of creation is born of Sor and Dara, under the careful care of Leriya. None are "good" or "evil" in the traditional sense; all three are carefully balanced against one another. Sor rules during the day (hence his association with the Sun), Dara across the night (the Moons), but Leriya is constant, ensuring that day begets the night, and night yields to day. Each sees their own place rise and fall, each has a check on the other two, and each works with another to provide both benefit and price to the beings below.

Unlike most of the other relgions on Azgaarnoth, most Trinitarian temples have one of each of the Triune clergy present: one Sorian, one Daran, and one Leriyan cleric. Rarely do Trinitarians foster or care for a congregation without the other two, though Trinitarian adventurers are often found "alone" (even when in a group).

## Clerical Details
Clerics of the Trinitarians are some of the most versatile in Azgaarnoth, as all three provide their clerics a unique ability--that of changing domains over time. "Sor sees no difference between Light, Sun, and Fire, for all are His aspects, and all serve His purposes," the Sorian clergy teach, and the Daran and Leriyan have similar sayings. Some Trinitarian clergy have moved through a half-dozen or more domains in their lifetimes, driven by divine guidance or their inner search for a true definition of themselves.

What is less common, but still (somewhat) reasonable is that Trintiarians may also change which of the Triune Gods they worship; because all things are in balance, the Trinitarians believe that some must move through various phases of their worship just as living beings move through various phases of their life: from Leriya (youth, desire) to Sor (their peak of influence and "light" upon the world) to Dara (as one's life ebbs and approaches the comfort of the night), for example.

> ### Game Notes
> When a cleric devoted to one of the Triune Gods levels up, they have the opportunity to change domains if they wish. Doing so means forgoing the benefits and features of their old domain, but also gaining the benefits of features of the new domain, as if they had been that domain from the beginning. Any domain spells from the old domain are lost; new domain spells may be immediately acquired and used.
> In game terms, the player must do nothing more than pray to their Triune God and spend a long rest in quiet meditation and contemplation. 
> If the player wishes to change dieties, this requires more in-game work; the character must journey to a Trinitarian temple and spend a week in deep commune with the clergy there, during which time the player is unable to access any domain features whatsoever. During that time, the cleric undergoes several rituals to end their time as an agent of the old, and several more to mark their time beginning as an agent of the new. At the end of that week, the player may select a new domain appropriate to the new Triune God, taking on the new domain features of that domain as mentioned above.
