# The Trinitarian Church

A splinter faction of the Kaevarian Church, the Trinitarians believe in a triune god over all things--that, in essence, Kaevar manifests in three forms (Sor, Dara, and Leriya), each with their own distinct name, each with their own distinct domains, and each working simultaneously in concert and opposition with one another.

## Sor
*The Father; the Sun*

## Dara
*The Mother; the Moons*

## Leriya
*The Lover; Life; Nature*
