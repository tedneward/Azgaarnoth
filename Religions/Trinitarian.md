# The Trinitarian Church

A splinter faction of the Kaevarian Church, the Trinitarians believe in a triune god over all things--that, in essence, Kaevar manifests in three forms, each with their own distinct name, each with their own distinct domains, and each working simultaneously in concert and opposition with one another.
