# Al'Uma

The Al'Uman religion is built around the worship of the Eldar: had [humanity](../Races/Humans.md) (and the Firstborn) shown the proper reverence to those who had ruled the world, the Eldar would never have Fallen, the Hordes would never have begun their march across the continents, the Exodus would never have been required (and thus the Returns would never have been needed, much less failed), and all of the mortal races could live in peace and harmony today, instead of the state of near-constant warfare and strife.

To that end the Al'Uman theology centers around religious observances of varying levels of strictness--Morning and Evening Prayers, for example, are a bare minimum necessary to be considered a practicing Al'Uman, along with an open adherence to the Merevetsian Creed. Numerous ceremonies and rituals litter the Al'Uman calendar, but beyond the Morning and Evening Prayers and the Merevetsian Creed, disputes emerge regarding what is "truly" Al'Uman and what is apostate or heretic.

The most obvious of these disputes is the dispute between the Prophet [Alalihat](../People/Alalihat.md) and his Disciple [Zabalasa](../People/Zabalasa.md) around the nature of mortal responsibility to the Eldar. Alalihat held that the Eldar required veneration before all else, and so mortals' first responsibility is religious observance; Zabalasa, on the other hand, believes that Alalihatian worship puts too much of the burden upon the Eldar, and holds that the Eldar require mortals to shoulder their part of the burden--particularly the ever-present war against the Hordes. (When the Hordes fled south, leaving [Yithia](../Nations/Yithia.md) and [Zhi](../Nations/Zhi.md) in their place, Al'Umans seized upon the mixed-Hordish heritage of those peoples as proof of Hordish allegiance. This allowed them expanded scope of their holy conflict to include those tribes, which some argue was more a decision of convenience--Zabalasans were not great sailors--than reasoned theology.)

## Game notes
A cleric of the Al'Uman religion is always of either the Alalihatian, Zabalasan, or Alamalz traditions; there are no other traditions recognized within Al'Uma (although apostasy is always possible, it's up the GM whether apostate Al'Uman clerics are actually receiving spells, and from whom--or what). Clerics of the *al'maeran* are tolerated, but not welcomed, among the other traditions.
