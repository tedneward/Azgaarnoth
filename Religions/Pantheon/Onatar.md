# Pantheon: Onatar
*Workman of the Immortals, God of the Forge*

Onatar is the god of blacksmithing, fire, and crafts. Onatar is a patron of all the civilized arts, though smiths are his special charges. Bards' tales say that volcanoes mark the sites of his forges.

Despite being ugly and deformed, Onatar is highly honored among the gods as their armorer and smith. He served as the blacksmith of the gods, and is worshipped in the manufacturing and industrial centers of Azgaarnoth, particularly among the dwarvish merchant guilds.
