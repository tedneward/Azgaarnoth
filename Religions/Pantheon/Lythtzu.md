# Pantheon: Lythtzu
*Goddess of Victory*

Lythtzu is the personification of the spirit of victory. As such, she is a somewhat shallow being who thinks only of conflict and ultimate triumph. If a problem or situation can't be described in terms of conflict, with definite conditions for declaring victory, Lythtzu considers it beneath her notice. She is not a very popular deity except among victorious people.

## Dogma
To Lythtzu, victory is the only thing that matters. However, as a lawful deity, she does not approve of deceit or subterfuge. Victory comes to the deserving: the brave, the noble, and the forthright. A victory ignobly won is no victory at all.
