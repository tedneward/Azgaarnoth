Nike is the personification of the spirit of victory. As such, she is a somewhat shallow being who thinks only of conflict and ultimate triumph. If a problem or situation cant be described in terms of conflict, with definite conditions for declaring victory, Nike considers it beneath her notice. She is not a very popular deity except among victorious people. Nike gradually came to be recognized as a sort of mediator of success between gods and men. Nike's Roman name was appropriately Victoria.
Worshipers, Clergy & Temples
Nike has very few clerics, though various fanatical cabals and factions often include clerics of Nike. Such clerics are convinced that their particular faction or philosophy is destined for ultimate victory.

Temples
Nike's shrines and temples are built to commemorate great victories and thus can be found nearly anywhere. Winning armies often build shrines on battlefields to thank Nike for their victory. Likewise, many generals and noble families build shrines to Nike to commemorate their victories.

Dogma
To Nike, victory is the only thing that matters. However, as a lawful deity, she does not approve of deceit or subterfuge. Victory comes to the deserving: the brave, the noble, and the forthright. A victory ignobly won is no victory at all.
