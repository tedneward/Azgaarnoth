# The Traveler
*Master of Stealth, the Irrepressible Scamp*

The Traveler is the deity of thievery, cunning, and the periodic instigation of anarchy into the machinations of other gods.

When he appears, he often appears as a handsome humanoid, often a halfling. (To the halflings, he is often recognized by the name Brandobaris.) The Traveler is always ready with a joke or a jug, yet he is such an agreeable, friendly rapscallion that he rarely makes an enemy. He's always well dressed and ready with a smart reply to any attempt at conversation. He has a bawdy sense of humor and little sense of propriety. The Traveler often goes on adventures to find some item he believes wilt make life more comfortable for him, though this does not always prove to work out as he had planned. The moral lesson of many of his journeys and scrapes is that it is better not to dash off unprepared into danger, let alone on foolish dares. Nonetheless, The Traveler does come across as an appealing sort of scamp. He has much of the Traveler in him; he is primarily a clever thief who fools his opponents into thinking him harmless, then steals them blind and escapes their wrath. No matter how awful a situation in which he finds himself (and he's found some pretty awful ones), The Traveler manages to find his way out again â€” and make a profit from the episode as well.

The mischievous Master of Stealth is always on the lockout for a worthy risk and challenge to face, and he may even seek out a highly skilled halfling thief or two to join him in some caper as he wanders the Prime. Other thieves may come along on such jaunts, but if they do not worship The Traveler they might find some of their valuables missing when the adventure is over. The Traveler reveals his identity only after the adventure is over, and only to his followers. The Traveler's adventures can be exceptionally challenging and dangerous, but hold the promise of great reward for the fast, the clever, and the quiet!

## Worshipers, Clergy & Temples
The church of Misadventure, as The Traveler's "organized" religion is known, teems with adventuresome troublemakers who usually emerge from some dangerous endeavor better off than when they entered it. Though most halflings (particularly children) love stories of their exploits, most halflings would prefer that the church of The Traveler keep far away from their own lives and are personally unwilling to get involved in the misadventurous capers of the Traveler's entourage. Many strong heart communities discourage The Traveler' worship, and some even view The Traveler and his cult as a perversion of the civilized world.

Hands of Misadventure, as clerics of The Traveler are known, engage in difficult, dangerous pursuits such as adventuring, always valuing the story of a given success far more than the physical treasure such a success might bring with it. Though Hands frequently engage in confidence schemes or larceny, they do so for the thrill, with monetary rewards simply garnishing the pleasure that comes from mastering one's (albeit occasionally illegal) craft. Those who cannot adventure, whether due to age or infirmity, serve the faith by running safehouses and by spreading glorious tales among the sedentary majority of the halfling populace. Some clerics multiclass as rogues.

## Vestments
Given the informal nature of the church of The Traveler, regular adventuring gear serves as the ceremonial garb of priests of the Master of Stealth. For most priests, this includes leather armor (or, in very rare cases when they can acquire it, silenced elven chain mail), a cloak in a subdued hue, and when feeling particularly jaunty, a feathered cap of some sort. They employ the weapons and tools of the trade, favoring clubs, daggers, knives, slings, and short swords for situations where combat cannot be avoided. The holy symbol of the faith is a small purloined object of great value that the priest has personally blessed, typically a gold or platinum coin or jewel of some sort.

## Temples
The Traveler is unique in that his church has no actual temples or permanent shrines at all. The Master of Stealth is honored instead through adventurous activity and by relating tales of his exploits and those of his followers. In a sense, a shrine of The Traveler is temporarily created whenever a story involving the Traveler is told or whenever an item commemorating one of his misadventures is brought out and remembered.

## Hierarchy
Novices of The Traveler are known as Wayward Rascals. Full priests of the Master of Stealth are known as the Hands of Misadventure. In ascending order of rank, the titles used by Brandobarian priests are Scamp, Rascal, Swindler, Blackguard, Traveler, Rapscallion, Knave, and Master Rogue. High-ranking priests have unique individual titles. Specialty priests are known as Misadventurers.

## Rituals
Hands of Misadventure pick one time of day or night to consistently pray for spells (those who prefer public displays of bravado usually choose to pray during the day, with the sneakier, more subtle Hands electing to pray under the light of the moon).

As one might expect, followers of The Traveler have little in the way of formal ceremony when they venerate the Master of Stealth. On nights of the new moon, no matter where they are, followers of The Traveler are expected to hide one or more stolen items from the previous month's take in the best hiding place they can find as part of a ritual known as the Traveler's Tithe. If The Traveler is pleased with the offering (which has less to do with the value of the offering than it does with the amount of risk required to acquire it), it vanishes from its cache by morning, any the worshiper is blessed with the Traveler's favor for the following month (in game terms, this translates into a +1 bonus on a single saving throw that must be used within the next month at the character's discretion).

## Orders
The Midknights of Misadventure are an informal fellowship composed primarily of halfling clerics and fighter/thieves. While hardly a formal military order, small bands of Midknights perform jailbreaks and other rescue operations in situations where an imprisoned follower of The Traveler faces death or torture and escaping without assistance is very unlikely. The composition and membership of a particular band varies widely, but half a dozen or so Midknights of widely varying skills and abilities are typically available at any given time in cities or regions with sizable halfling populations.

Many [Rogues' Guilds](../../Organizations/RoguesGuilds/index.md), particularly those that focus more on thievery than violence, are informal or formal worshipers of The Traveler, and more than one Guild is in fact a temple to Misadventure.

## Dogma
Seek excitement and danger wherever your feet take you, for risk-taking leads to life's greatest rewards. Lust for the thrill, not for the treasure, for greed obscures the true prize of the experience. At the end of the day, the halfling with the wildest tale is the most honored in the eyes of the Irrepressible Scamp.

## Appearance, Manifestations
The Traveler appears as a talkative halfling, cheerfully willing to tell stories of his exploits and adventures. He is curious, but can be easily distracted. He has scraggly short brown hair, and a large smile. He is often wearing a light tunic and brown breeches, with a sheathed dagger and coiled rope at his hip.
