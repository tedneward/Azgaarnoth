# Pantheon: Arawn
*The Lord of Death, the Silent One, the Grim Reaper*

Arawn was given governance of the underworld when his sister [Brigantia](Brigantia.md) came into the fullness of her being. When [Gruumsh](Gruumsh.md) killed her husband [Azuth](Azuth.md), he swore his help to [Brigantia](Brigantia.md), and journeyed with her and frequently helped her avoid the snares of the Land of the Dead. His countenance may be dour and gloomy, but death, in his view, is simply the last stage of life, and something to be considered a reward for service, not a place of fear and punishment. His aspect as the "grim reaper" is that of carrying out an obligation in the natural cycle of life, looking to ease the departed into the afterlife.

## Worshipers, Clergy & Temples
Arawn's clerics tend to share their patron's dour, gloomy demeanor. They officiate at funerals and annual rites in honor of departed ancestors. 

## Vestments
Clerics of Arawn often wear black robes.

## Hierarchy
Most temples of Arawn are only staffed by one or two clergy, so no formal hierarchy exists within the ranks of the clergy. Positions of leadership are often established for a particular situation, and when the situation is resolved, are yielded.

## Temples
Temples to Arawn are usually built underground, in caves, or at least sunken so their floors are below ground level. They tend to be dark and windowless, creating an atmosphere of gloom reminiscent of the underworld's darkness.

## Rituals
Most funerals are rituals to Arawn. These are often bittersweet affairs, in which the cleric mourns the loss of the departed, but then looks to lift the spirits of the mourners by telling them of the departed's accomplishments and deeds.

## Festivals
Arawn's temples typically celebrate no festivals, as few wish to be reminded of their limited time upon the earth. However, Arawn clergy are first to assist with other temples' festivals (such as [Brigantia's Greengrass and Highharvesttide](Brigantia.md#festivals) festivals), as life is a full part of the cycle, and they work to help those who would otherwise struggle to celebrate (owing to sickness, injury, or other health issue).

## Dogma
Unlike some deities whose portfolio includes death, Arawn is not particularly malicious or hateful toward the mortals whose souls come to his realm. Death, he teaches, is the lot of all mortals, the thing that sets them apart from deities, and it must be accepted even if it brings grief. Arawn also sees no opposition in life, and often works to help those who died "before their time" to return to life to fulfill their destinies.
