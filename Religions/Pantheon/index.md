# The Pantheon / The "Old Gods"
"The Pantheon" is the general label, alongside the slightly more derogatory "Old Gods", to refer to the pantheon of gods that are thought to have created the Eldar in the first place. The Pantheon of divinities are thought to be distantly observing the progress of the world, though whether in judgment or keen interest is not clear. The Gods have made no presence felt in Azgaarnoth in recorded history, although the clerics who worship them receive spells and (according to those clerics) guidance, suggesting that the Pantheon is every bit as real as the Eldar were (or are).

Each member of the Pantheon has sway over one or more particular domains, and while some have a wide number of followers, others seem to be more obscure and only known to a few. While most of the Pantheon is fundamentally of a "good" cosmic perspective, whispers of "evil" gods are always present, and if these gods exist, their worshippers (and temples and ceremonies) are buried deep in society. This is not to say the evil gods do not exist--they simply are not worshipped openly. (Ugly rumors persist that the [Dread Emperor](../../People/DreadEmperor.md) has offered a home to many of the darker or more evil Pantheonic religions, in exchange for their service to his throne, but nothing has been proven, and certainly the Dread Emperor himself will not say.) 

Among the known gods/goddesses of the Pantheon (and their associated domains) are:

^1: The Cat Lord, while worshipped by some tabaxi, is not considered a god to most other religious scholars. However, clerics worshipping him do get their prayers answered, and the religious scholars aren't quite sure what to make of that, either.

Other gods and goddesses are openly worshipped as well; in fact, many scholars of the divine believe that a deity's power varies directly with the number (and fervor) of those who worship them, so the power and influence of dieties waxes and wanes as they gain or lose followers. Others scoff at this notion, but it does seem to hold some weight, in that certain gods and goddesses rise to some level of widespread influence, then slowly fade over time to be replaced by others.

It's important to note that many theologians in Azgaarnoth are convinced that many of the old gods worshipped as separate entities are, in fact, different facets of the same entity, such as Baravar Cloakshadow (the goddess of illusion and deception worshipped mostly among the gnomish communities) and Brandovaris (the god of adventure and thievery to many halflings) are both facets of the same trickster god ([The Traveler](Traveler.md)). If this were true, it could suggest that far fewer old gods actually exist, but since clerics of each of those dieties keep having their prayers answered, this is hard to prove or disprove. Presumably only the old gods themselves know the truth, and they're not telling. Because of the many overlaps, it is not uncommon for non-clerical devotees of a god to find themselves workshipping alongside others of like mind, even if the diety has different names.

Additionally, some of these gods are known beyond Azgaarnoth; this should not surprise, given that the Material plane comprises a near-infinite number of worlds, and the gods are extraplanar creatures.

Most Pantheon worship is decentralized, with scattered temples and buildings across Azgaarnoth, usually close to the physical expression of the god's domain. Some temples consist of the home of a cleric living within a village, or a concrete building attended by villagers on a regular basis; it depends greatly on the domain, the cleric, and the village.

Becoming a cleric of a Pantheon god (often known as being a "Patheonite") is usually a matter of finding an existing cleric willing to take on an apprentice/acolyte, then engaging in study and worship, and if the god finds the individual worthy, that individual finds "the god's voice" and hears the call of the god's wishes for the future.
