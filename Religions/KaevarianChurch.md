# Church of Kaevar

The Kaevarian Church is a monotheistic religion, holding that there is one God (Kaevar) from whom all other life and beings are created, including the Eldar and all of the races. Mildly popular all across Azgaarnoth, the Kaevarian Church does not stand against any worship of the Gods or the Eldar, but instead preaches that Kaevar operates through all of them, and that they who serve these "lesser gods" are actually serving the purposes of Kaevar Himself.

Kaevarian doctrine is one primarily around Law and Order; while good and evil exist in the world, the worst evils come when society breaks down as a whole. If fulfilling the law perpetuates evil, that is to be avoided, but sometimes tolerated, so long as the rule of law is maintained and perpetuated. "In time," Kaevarian priests will say, "the Law will make all things right." For this reason, Kaevarian temples are welcomed in [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md): since the Dread Emperor is the Law, and Kaevar operates through the Law, it stands to reason that Kaevar operates through the Dread Emperor. (Other religious groups find this line of argument entirely self-serving, and it remains one of the most hotly debated elements of Kaevarian theology.)

Kaevarian priests, strangely enough, encompass nearly all the clerical domains available; specifically, a Kaevarian cleric can choose from among the following domains:

* [Arcana](/Classes/Cleric/Arcana.md)
* [Death](/Classes/Cleric/Death.md)
* Elements: [Air](/Classes/Cleric/Air.md), [Earth](/Classes/Cleric/Earth.md), [Fire](/Classes/Cleric/Fire.md), [Water](/Classes/Cleric/Water.md)
* [Forge](/Classes/Cleric/Forge.md)
* [Grave](/Classes/Cleric/Grave.md)
* [Knowledge](/Classes/Cleric/Knowledge.md)
* [Life](/Classes/Cleric/Life.md)
* [Light](/Classes/Cleric/Light.md)
* [Nature](/Classes/Cleric/Nature.md)
* [Order](/Classes/Cleric/Order.md)
* [Protection](/Classes/Cleric/Protection.md)
* [Tempest](/Classes/Cleric/Tempest.md)
* [Twilight](/Classes/Cleric/Twilight.md)
* [Unity](/Classes/Cleric/Unity.md)
* [War](/Classes/Cleric/War.md)
* [Zeal](/Classes/Cleric/Zeal.md)

Kaevarian paladins are rare, however, and are almost always assumed to be divinely inspired by Kaevar to accomplish a singular mission (of large scale, usually to take a lifetime) before their death.

## Singularian Heresy
It is rumored that there is a heretical religious order within the Kaevarian Church that secretly works to eliminate all other religious worship in favor of Kaevar alone; while the Kaevarian Church disavows their theology and openly hunts those who promote the Singularian Heresy, it continues to operate, masquerading as Kaevarian clergy and subtly seeking to steer Kaevarian events to a universal worship of the One-and-only-True-God-of-All.
