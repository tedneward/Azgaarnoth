The Kaevarian Church is a monotheistic religion, holding that there is one God (Kaevar) from whom all other life and beings are created, including the Eldar and all of the races. Mildly popular all across Azgaarnoth, the Kaevarian Church does not stand against any worship of the Gods or the Eldar, but instead preaches that Kaevar operates through all of them, and that they who serve these "lesser gods" are actually serving the purposes of Kaevar Himself.

Kaevarian doctrine is one primarily around Law and Order; while good and evil exist in the world, the worst evils come when society breaks down as a whole. If fulfilling the law perpetuates evil, that is to be avoided, but sometimes tolerated, so long as the rule of law is maintained and perpetuated. "In time," Kaevarian priests will say, "the Law will make all things right." For this reason, Kaevarian temples are welcomed in [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md): since the Dread Emperor is the Law, and Kaevar operates through the Law, it stands to reason that Kaevar operates through the Dread Emperor. (Other religious groups find this line of argument entirely self-serving, and it remains one of the most hotly debated elements of Kaevarian theology.)
