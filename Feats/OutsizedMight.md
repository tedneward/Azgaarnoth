## Outsized Might
You have absorbed primeval magic that allows you, despite your relatively small stature, to embody the might of titanic creatures. This grants you the following benefits:

* **Little but Mighty.** You gain proficiency in either the Athletics or Acrobatics skill.
* **Powerful Build.** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the amount you can push, drag, or lift.
* **Stalwart.** You have advantage on saving throws against being moved or knocked prone.
