## Pack Master
*Prerequisites: Gnoll, BAB +1*

When taking down prey, the gnolls would surround dangerous opponents, rendering them ineffective in combat.

When flanking an opponent, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to armor class against that opponent for each other gnoll (or other packmate) that is also flanking the opponent.
