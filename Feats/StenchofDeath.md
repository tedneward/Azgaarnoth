## Stench of Death
*Prerequisites: Gnoll*

Known to languish in piles of filth and carrion, gnolls sometimes reek of things worse than urine.

You exude a terrible scent as a 15-foot aura that nearly every other creature finds repulsive. All living creatures (except those with the stench aura ability) within the aura must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the gnoll's character level + Constitution modifier) or be sickened for 5 rounds. Creatures that succeed at the saving throw cannot be sickened by the same creature's stench aura for 24 hours. A [delay poison](../Magic/Spells/delay-poison.md) or [neutralize poison](../Magic/Spells/neutralize-poison.md) spell or similar effect removes the effect from the sickened creature. This is a poison effect.
