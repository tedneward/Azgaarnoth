## Fey Touched
Your exposure to the Feywild or one of its denizens has left a magical mark on you. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You learn the [misty step](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/misty-step) spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the divination or enchantment school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
