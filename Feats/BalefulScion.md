## Baleful Scion
*Prerequisite: 4th Level, [Scion of the Outer Planes (Evil Outer Plane) Feat](ScionoftheOuterPlanes.md)*

You can channel cosmic forces of evil that cause pain but invigorate your being. You can choose your own actions despite this malign connection. You gain the following benefits:

* **Ability Score Increase**. Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* **Life-Draining Grasp**. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can also deal necrotic damage to it. The damage equals 1d6 + your proficiency bonus, and you regain a number of hit points equal to this necrotic damage dealt. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
