## Tower of Iron Will
*Prerequisite*: Psionic Talent feature or [Wild Talent feat](#wild-talent)

Your mind's defenses are formidable. After you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw, you can use your reaction to roll your Psionic Talent die and add the number rolled to the saving throw, potentially causing it to succeed.
