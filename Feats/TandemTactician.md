## Tandem Tactician
Your presence in a scrap tends to elevate your comrades. You gain the following benefits:

* You can use the Help action as a bonus action.
* When you use the Help action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, increase the range of the Help action by 10 feet. Additionally, you can help two allies targeting the same creature within range when you use the Help action this way.
