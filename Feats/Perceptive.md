## Perceptive
You hone your senses until they become razor sharp. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency in the Perception skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.
* Being in a lightly obscured area doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks if you can both see and hear.
