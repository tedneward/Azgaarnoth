## Naturalist
Your extensive study of nature rewards you with the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency in the Nature skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.
* You learn the [druidcraft]() and [detect poison and disease]() spells. You can cast [detect poison and disease]() once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
