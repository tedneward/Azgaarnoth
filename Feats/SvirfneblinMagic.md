## Svirfneblin Magic
*Prerequisite: Gnome (deep gnome)*

You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast [nondetection]() on yourself at will, without needing a material component.

You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: [blindness/deafness](), [blur](), and [disguise self](). You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
