## Mounted Charge
*Prerequisite: Mounted Combatant, or flight abilities*

As a mounted combatant (or as a flying creature), you have learned how to charge past an opponent and execute your attacks (including those of your mount) and pass the target without triggering attacks of opportunity. (For flying creatures, this is known as a "Flyby".)
