## Vicious Bite
*Prerequisites: Str 13+, gnoll*

You have developed a ferocious bite that even other gnolls fear.

You gain a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, plus half of your Strength modifier. You are considered proficient with this attack and can apply feats or effects that modify natural attacks to your bite. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite is considered a secondary attack and is made at your full base attack bonus -5, and it adds only half your Strength modifier to damage.
