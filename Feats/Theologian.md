## Theologian
Your extensive study of religion rewards you with the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency in the Religion skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.
* You learn the [thaumaturgy](../Magic/Spells/thaumaturgy.md) and [detect evil and good](../Magic/Spells/detect-evil-and-good.md) spells. You can cast [detect evil and good](../Magic/Spells/detect-evil-and-good.md) once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
