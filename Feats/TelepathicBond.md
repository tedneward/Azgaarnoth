## Telepathic Bond
*Prerequisite*: Telepathic feat in two creatures

You form a deep, mind-linked bond with another Telepathic creature. You each gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 21.
* So long as you are each within 60 feet of each other, you may communicate without requiring speech (or even air).
* When in combat, each of you rolls Initiative, but you share the higher of the two Initiative die rolls.
* You may pool your Psionic Talent dice.

If one of the bond dies, the other faces deep anguish, insanity, and often death.
