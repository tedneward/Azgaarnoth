## Terrifying Howl
*Prerequisites: Gnoll*

Your howl is that of the stalking predator, and can terrify your quarry.

Non-gnolls in 60' radius must make Will save DC 10 + 1/2 HD + Cha mod or become shaken for 1d4 rounds plus 1 round per additional 5 rolled over the DC. Gnolls use this howl before combat and often from stealth. Each additional gnoll using this feat in the radius of effect grants a +1 cumulative DC to the effect.
