## Recharge Breath
*Prerequisite: must have a breath weapon*

After you use your innate breath weapon, you may roll a d6 at the beginning of each of your turns. On a 6, your breath weapon is recharged. If your breath already recharges on a 6, it instead recharges on a 5 or a 6. You may take this feat up to two times, but the recharge cannot go below 5.
