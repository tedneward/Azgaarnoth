# Immerstal "the Red" Paedralian
*male dwarf (mountain) Wizard (Aeromancer) 9, CG*

## Description
Head of [Five Elements](../Organizations/MageSchools/FiveElements.md) school in [Brinwal](../Cities/Brinwal.md).

Immerstal is by all accounts an extremely competent mage, but he is not known to be a great teacher. In truth he heads the school only so that the Five Elements will partly fund his workshop, which he uses to fund his research. His students are mostly self-taught, and have no loyalty to Immerstal or the school. The Red is openly disdainful of "wilders" and "rootless vagabond" magi who insist on traveling, and has more than once seen another arcane spellcaster passing through town as a rival--sometimes even going so far as to openly declare an arcane duel.
