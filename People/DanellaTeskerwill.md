# Danella [Teskerwill](/Organizations/Houses/Teskerwill.md)
*Human female Commoner*

## Description
Danella is the picture of the dutiful daughter, and being of marriageable age, she has decided to take her future into her own hands by choosing her husband, rather than waiting for her father to find one for her (particularly since her father seems unwilling or unable to do so). Her main interest is in finding a good husband, aiding him in his rise, and extending her family's influence through children and advantageous marriage. She is likely to become a powerful matriarch of the House as she grows older and more experienced.

Third and youngest child of [Owen](OwenTeskerwill.md). Dating a cousin of [House Jarmaath](Jarmaath.md), and will likely marry into that House before long, cementing further ties between Jarmaath and Teskerwill.
