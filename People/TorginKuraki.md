# Torgin Kuraki
A veteran of a rough street-level upbringing, Torgin Kuraki is a [Yithian](../Nations/Yithi.md) who came west through a series of various adventures and misadventures, until he landed in Brinwal about ten years ago with a fairly heavy purse and a desire to stop wandering. Buying out the Thirsty Zombie inn from its previous proprietor, Torgin quickly established a reputation for tolerating a certain amount of rowdy behavior within his tavern (up to a point), providing an outlet for the feistier folks of the city. His years of living rough on the streets gave him a certain "bulk", much of which has grown softer in the years, but he still has the strength to act as his own bouncer, and between that and his heavy crossbow, "Last Call", he generally has no problems enforcing his own policies within the bar.

>***Action Surge (Recharges on short or long rest).*** On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.
>
>***Brute Force.*** Whenever you hit with a weapon that you're proficient with and deal damage, the weapon's damage increases by 1d4.
>
>***Crossbow Expert.*** You ignore the loading quality of crossbows with which you are proficient. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
>
>***Hand Crossbow.*** When you use the Attack action and attack with a one handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a hand crossbow you are holding.
>
>***Relentless Endurance (Recharges on long rest.)*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead.
>
>***Savage Attacks.*** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.
>
>#### Actions
>***Fighting Style: Unarmed Fighting.*** Your unarmed strikes can deal 1d6 + 3 + 1d4 (Brute Force) bludgeoning damage on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.
>
>***Unarmed Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 1d8 + 3  + 1d4 (Brute Force) bludgeoning damage.
>
>***Hand Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 30/120, one target. Hit: 1d6 + 1 + 1d4 (Brute Force) piercing damage. Light.
>
>***"Last Call" (Heavy Crossbow +1).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 100/400. Hit: 1d10 + 2 + 1d4 (Brute Force) piercing damage. Two-handed.
>
>#### Bonus Actions
>***Second Wind (Recharges on short or long rest).*** On your turn, you can regain 1d10 + 4 hit points.
>
>#### Equipment
>***"Last Call" (Heavy Crossbow +1).*** Whether Torgin found this weapon in his travels or had it manufactured, it is a magnificent heavy crossbow, keenly balanced, true-sighted, and light enough to carry (though not fire) in one hand. It usually occupies a shelf under the bar, but if he leaves the bar for any reason, it hangs from his belt alongside a quiver of 20 bolts.
>
>Hand crossbow and 20 bolts. This is Torgin's backup weapon, almost always in a hip holster whenever he is in the bar. He will often leave it holstered during a routine brawl (the better to focus on his Unarmed Strikes), but if things escalate he will start snapping off shots as bonus actions and move to the bar in order to be within easy range of Last Call.

>Dungeoneer's pack, or explorer's pack

#### Description
***Race: Half-Orc.*** When alliances between humans and orcs are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs, savage fury, and impressive cunning.

***Class: Fighter.*** Fighters share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. They are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

***Martial Archetype: Brute.*** Brutes are simple warriors who rely on mighty attacks and their own durability to overcome their enemies. Some brutes combine this physical might with tactical cunning. Others just hit things until those things stop hitting back.

***Feat: Crossbow Expert.*** Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you have some benefits when using one.
