## Description
A veteran of a rough street-level upbringing, Torgin Kuraki is a [Yithian](/Nations/Yithi.md) who came west through a series of various adventures and misadventures, until he landed in Brinwal about ten years ago with a fairly heavy purse and a desire to stop wandering. Buying out the Thirsty Zombie inn from its previous proprietor, Torgin quickly established a reputation for tolerating a certain amount of rowdy behavior within his tavern (up to a point), providing an outlet for the feistier folks of the city. His years of living rough on the streets gave him a certain "bulk", much of which has grown softer in the years, but he still has the strength to act as his own bouncer, and between that and his heavy crossbow, "Last Call", he generally has no problems enforcing his own policies within the bar.
