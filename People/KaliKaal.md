# Kali Kaal
*undead (human) NE Wizard (Necromancy) 20/Pale Master (Elegy of Decay) 20/Sorceror (Arcane Legacy) 20*

## History
Little is known of the ancient lich of millennia; even any sure knowledge of its gender is lost. 

Some think Kali is merely a myth, but others have had a closer visitation from Kali--and some have gone mad because of it. Legends and horror stories tell of Kali stalking thoes who have betrayed it for decades or more, waiting until the victim is absolutely convinced they are safe, and then stepping forward from shadows. Kali rarely kills its victims, preferring instead to add to its legend and striking in ways that leave the victim alive and utterly subservient (or powerless).

Stories and rumors abound that Kali has even managed to find ways to be a [Warlock Patron](/Classes/Warlock/Undead.md), granting of its power to warlocks who then serve his purposes without question or hesitation. 

What is known is that it is long past any concern for humanity, including its own. Its goals are inscrutable, its resources are nearly unlimited, and its morals are entirely nonexistent.

## GM Notes
Kali runs the [Red Rose](../Organizations/RoguesGuilds/RedRose.md) rogues' guild and works towards its own mysterious ends. It has some kind of historical relationship to the [Twilight Star](../Organizations/MageSchools/TwilightStar.md) school, but it is not clear whether it is antagonistic or a rivalry.

Statistics are provided below, but few beings on Azgaarnoth could even last a single round against it. Its knowledge of arcana is unparalleled, its resources vast, and its lair is entirely secret except to a few "privileged" individuals high within the organization of the Red Rose--usually as a means of keeping them more firmly under its thumb. If PCs begin a search for Kali, it will know about it long before the PCs come anywhere remotely close; if they find a lair, it will be because Kali desires it. If they encounter it outside of its lair, it will be entirely prepared for any attempt to strike at it or entrap it; in fact, most "encounters" with Kali are elaborate illusion magic unless Kali wants to be physically present.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Kali fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Rejuvenation**. Kali has learned to support multiple phylacteries; so long as any one of his phylacteries exists, Kali gains a new body in 1d10 days, appearing within 5 feet of any one of his phylacteries (its choice), regaining all its hit points and becoming active again.

**Spellcasting**. Kali is an 20th-level spellcaster as a Sorceror, Wizard, and Pale Master. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 36, +19 to hit with spell attacks).

Kali's long existence means that it has seen almost any scenario possible play out, and this means it has the ability to anticipate its needs for any situation that might arise. For any encounter with Kali, should it actually descend into any form of combat (and Kali wishes to continue with it), it is safe to assume that it has prepared ahead of time any spells it may find useful.

Kali's spell slots are also entirely interchangable, so that it has the following slots at each level:

* 1st: 12 slots
* 2nd: 9 slots
* 3rd: 9 slots
* 4th: 9 slots
* 5th: 9 slots
* 6th: 3 slots
* 7th: 3 slots
* 8th: 3 slots
* 9th: 3 slots

In addition, Kali has spent a millennium assembling spell books of all kinds and schools, and if given time to prepare, will have access to any spell ever developed anywhere on the continent of Azgaarnoth.

**Turn Resistance**. Kali has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead. In addition, Kali's depth of undeath is such that any successful attempts to "turn" do not affect it other than to give it disadvantage on any die rolls for the duration of the turn.

#### Actions
**Paralyzing Touch.** Melee Spell Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (3d6) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Legendary Actions
Kali can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Kali regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Spellcasting.** Kali casts a cantrip, 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-level spell.

**Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions)**. Kali uses its Paralyzing Touch.

**Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions)**. Kali fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 36 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to Kali’s gaze for the next 24 hours.

**Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions)**. Each non-undead creature within 20 feet of Kali must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Kali can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; Kali can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* Kali rolls a d10 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.
* Kali targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers Kali to the target. Whenever Kali takes damage, the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, Kali takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until Kali or the target is no longer in Kali’s lair.
* Kali calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that Kali can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear.
