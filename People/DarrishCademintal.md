# Darrish [Cademintal](../Organizations/Houses/Cademintal.md)
*male elf (wood) Rogue (Assassin) 11/Leader 5, NE*

## Description
Secretly holds rank in the [Fire Knives](../Organizations/RoguesGuilds/FireKnives.md) Rogues' Guild in [Stagraven](../Cities/Stagraven.md). House Cademintal at large is unaware of their distant cousin's affiliation with the Knives, and would be horrified and extremely quick to disown, disinvest, and disembowel Darrish, so he keeps the House's presence--and the Knives' presence--in Stagraven extremely small.

His activities are unknown to his family, including his wife Marova (Human Female, NG) or his children.
