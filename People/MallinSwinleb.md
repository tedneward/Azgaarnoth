# Lord Mallin Swinleb 
*male half-elf Fighter (Psi Knight) 10/Rogue (Soul Knife) 7, CG*

**Title:** Lord, [Order of the Copper Dragon](../Organizations/DraconicOrder/Copper.md)

**Residence:** [Stagraven](/Cities/Stagraven.md)

## Description
Mallin goes to great lengths to hide his psi abilities, and will not hesitate to use his talents to ensure his secret remains safe (blackmail first, elimination if necessary). His fighter and roguish prowess are widely known, and usually that provides enough discouragement to anyone who might try to pick a direct fight with him.

He is in a relationship with [Veloria Mandragoran](VeloriaMandragoran.md) in [Brinwal](/Cities/Brinwal.md), and the pair frequently spend time with each other in each others' cities under disguise. He has revealed his psi powers to her, as has she revealed her College of Glamour abiities to him.
