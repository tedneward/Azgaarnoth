## Description
Mallin goes to great lengths to hide his psi abilities, and will not hesitate to use his talents to ensure his secret remains safe (blackmail first, elimination if necessary).

He is in a relationship with [Veloria Mandragoran](VeloriaMandragoran.md) in [Brinwal](/Cities/Brinwal.md), and the pair frequently spend time with each other in each others' cities under disguise. He has revealed his psi powers to her, as has she revealed her College of Glamour abiities to him.
