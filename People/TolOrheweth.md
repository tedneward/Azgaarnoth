# Pater Arn Tol Orheweth

**Title:** Pater Arn of the Kaevarian Church

**Residence:** [Migleme](../Cities/Migleme.md) ([Liria](../Nations/Liria.md))

Tol Orheweth is a middle-aged human, with lean features and the weather-beaten skin that is more commonly found among clergy in a village than the heavily-urbanized city of Migleme. His eyes are clear, with laugh lines, and he usually sports a closely-cropped beard just slightly shot with gray. Given a choice, he will dress casually and humbly, but his role in the Church rarely affords him that opportunity.

>***Blessed Healer.*** When you cast a spell with a spell slot and it restores hit points to any creature other than you this turn, you regain 2 + 20 hit points.
>
>***Channel Divinity (3/Recharges on short or long rest).*** See below for the details of each use.
>
>***Divine Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage to the target.
>
>***Elemental Touched.*** When you finish a long rest, you can choose which element you are attuned to: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. Depending on your choice, you can use the appropriate bonus action listed.
>
>***Indomitable Defense.*** Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you gain resistance to two damage types of your choice, choosing from bludgeoning, necrotic, piercing, radiant, and slashing.
>
>***Keen Mind.*** You always know which way is north, the number of hours left before the next sunrise or sunset, and you can accurately recall anything you have seen or heard within the past month.
>
>***Larger than Life (Recharges on a long rest).*** When you make a melee attack, you can increase that attack's reach by 5 feet.
>
>***Ritual Caster (Wizard).*** If you come across a spell in written form, you might be able to add it to your ritual book. The spell must be on the Wizard spell list, the spell's level can be no higher than 9, and it must have the *ritual* tag. The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents the material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.
>
>#### Actions
>***Channel Divinity: Radiant Defense.*** You channel blessed energy into an ally that you can see within 30 feet of you. The first time that ally is hit by an attack within the next minute, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + 20.
>
>***Channel Divinity: Turn Undead.***  You can use one of your uses of Channel Divinity to turn undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, if it is a CR of 4 or lower it is destroyed; otherwise it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
>
>***Divine Intervention (Recharges on long rest/seven days).*** Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than {npc.levels('Cleric')}, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
>
>***Indomitable Defense.*** You can temporarily give up your Indomitable Defense resistance and transfer it to one creature you touch. The creature keeps the resistance until the end of your next short or long rest or until you transfer it back to yourself as a bonus action.
>
>***Spellscarred Strike (Recharges after the end of your next turn).*** When you strike an enemy, you can lash out with a flicker of blue fire that passes through their flesh and removes something vital. You make an Unarmed Strike against a target within 5 feet. You may use either your Strength modifier or your Dexterity modifier to modify the attack roll, but you do not add either ability modifier to damage. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage and 1d4 force damage. The next time the target makes an attack roll before the end of its next turn, it coughs up sickly blue-black blood, and must either accept disadvantage on that attack roll or take 1d8 necrotic damage.

>#### Reactions
>***Shield of the Faithful.*** When a creature attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you impose disadvantage on the attack roll. To do so, you must be able to see both the attacker and the target. You interpose an arm, a shield, or some other part of yourself to try to throw the attack off target.
>
>***Sight of the Unseen.*** You gain the ability to see in both dim light and darkness as if they were bright light, but only out to a range of 5 feet. You can only end this effect during your turn, but doing so does not require an action. However, if the space you are in is exposed to bright light while this effect is active, you suffer disadvantage on sight-based Wisdom (Perception) checks until the end of your next turn. While this effect is active, your eyes are backlit with a dancing blue flame.
>
>
>#### Bonus Actions

>***Water-Touched (7/Recharges on long rest).*** You can create a forceful surge of water directed at a creature within 15 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 19) (which it can choose to fail) or be pushed up to 10 feet away from you.

#### Description
Tol Orheweth was born and raised in [Bedia](../Nations/Bedia.md), where as a teen he came to Kaevar and took his vows in the same small church he later came to lead. Catching the eye of Bedia's Archbishop after leading a spirited defense of the town against a pack of displacer beasts, Tol soon found his star rising among the western Kaevarian clergy. While the Archbishop kept throwing advancement opportunities at him, Tol instead chose to remain in Bedia, at first tending to his church alone, then later taking a more nomadic role across the countryside, traveling from parish to parish lending his aid and his faith to the villagers and townsfolk as needed. Finally, a few years ago, he agreed to accompany the Archbishop to Migleme for a Congregation of the Clergy, where he impressed many of his peers. When the Pater Arn passed away, his name was put forth as a nominee, and to many Archibishops' surprise, he was elected in a near-landslide, despite his relative youth.

Early in his life as a country priest, Tol had a close friend who was a mage, and from whom he learned the ability to manipulate arcane magic in rituals. Ever since, Tol's ritual book has been a constant companion, and many times during his adventures, he could be seen scribbling and taking notes on numerous arcane rituals; although he does not share the contents, it is thought that he has a significant number of arcane rituals within its covers, and he has not hesitated to cast from it when the need is present.

***Ideals:*** *Self-knowledge/Neutrality/Change.*

***Appearance:*** *Unusual skin color.*

***Talents:*** *Master of disguise.*

***Mannerisms:*** *Twirls hair or tugs beard.*

***Interactions with others:*** *Quiet with others.*

***Bond:*** *Protective of close family members.*

***Flaw:*** *Shameful or scandalous history.* As a small child, Tol ran away from home one cold winter's night and found a small fire elemental which, strangely, passively tolerated the human's presence and interaction. Thinking he had made a new friend, Tol brought the elemental back to his family home, where the elemental promptly escaped and set fire to the home. Several of Tol's family members perished in the blaze, and while the cause of the fire was never discovered, Tol bears the shameful knowledge that it was his actions that led to their deaths. His efforts to stop the blaze once started left him with a unique burn scar just over his heart, and this spellscar has carried strange eldritch power ever since. The rest of his skin suffered significant burns, and his skin is still to this day discolored in places, including patches of pale skin on his arms that are distinctively different from his otherwise tanned and leather-colored skin.

***Race: Human.*** Humans were the servant race of the Eldar and flourished and took over much of the lands after the Fall. It is not clear if humans were created by the Eldar, or were uplifted by them. Either way, humans owe their civilization to the initial one built by the Eldar, inheriting it after the Fall.

***Feat: Elemental Touched.*** You've been exposed to the primordial magic of the Elemental Planes, granting you a measure of control over the natural world around you.

***Class: Cleric.*** Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.

***Divine Domain: Protection.*** The protection domain is the purview of deities who charge their followers to shield the weak from the strong. The gods’ faithful dwell in villages and towns on the borderlands, where they help bolster defenses and seek out evils to defeat. These gods believe that a strong shield and a suit of armor is the best defense against evil, second only to a stout mace on hand to respond to any attacks in kind.

***Feat: Ritual Caster.*** You have learned a number of spells that you can cast as rituals. These spells are written in a ritual book, which you must have in hand while casting one of them.

***Feat: Spellscarred Savant.*** Your mastery of your spellscar allows you to tap into raw magical energy, either to harm others with its sizzling power or invigorate your own body. As your power grows, you can wield the fury of this raw magic as easily as a warrior does a blade, calling down the untempered essence of magic gone mad to burn foes to ash.

***Feat: Keen Mind.*** You have a mind that can track time, direction, and detail with uncanny precision.
