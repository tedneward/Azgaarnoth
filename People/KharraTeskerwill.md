## Description
Kharra Teskerwill is the oldest daughter of [Owen](OwenTeskerwill.md), and stands to inherit upon her father's death. She has always sought life beyond that of breeding, raising, and training horses, however, and has been actively training as part of the [Brinwal Lion Guard](/Cities/Brinwal.md). She has been quietly contemplating joining a mercenary company for a tour through Chidia or some other hot zone, something her father has vehemently opposed.
