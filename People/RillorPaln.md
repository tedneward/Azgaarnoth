# Rillor Paln
*male human Rogue (Thief) 11, NE*

## Description
Nightmaster of the [Black Knives](../Organizations/RoguesGuilds/BlackKnives.md) in [Brinwal](/Cities/Brinwal.md); secretly allied to [House Kaal](../Organizations/Houses/Kaal.md); in a relationship with [Verrasa Kaal](VerrasaKaal.md). 

He holds no loyalties to Brinwal, and at the first sign of major difficulties or trouble, he will light out on a ship (hidden in a smugglers' cove about ten miles up the shore to the north) for either Stagraven, Northraven, or Stagrorest, whichever seems the safest. Doing so will likely end his relationship with Lady Kaal, however, as she will take it as a personal betrayal.
