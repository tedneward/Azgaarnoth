**Combat Superiority.** You have five (four as a base, one from 7th level) superiority dice, which are d10s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. (You gain another superiority die at 15th level.) You can expend superiority dice to gain a number of different benefits:

* **Precision Attack**. When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.

* **Sharpened Attack**. When you damage a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the damage roll. You can use this ability after rolling damage. If the attack causes the target to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, it has disadvantage on that save.

* **Sharpened Senses**. When you make a Wisdom (Perception) check to detect a hidden creature or object, or a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine if someone is lying to you, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this feature after seeing the total but before learning if you succeeded or failed.

* **Superior Willpower**. When you make an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this feature only before you learn if the save succeeded or failed.

**Hunter's Mysticism.** Your study of the supernatural gives you a limited ability to use magic. You can cast [Detect Magic]() as a ritual. You can cast [Protection from Evil and Good](), but you cannot cast it again with this feature until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

**Monster Slayer.** Whenever you expend superiority dice to add to a damage roll, you can expend up to two dice instead of just one, adding both to the roll. Both dice are expended as normal. If the target of your attack is an aberration, a fey, a fiend, or an undead, you deal maximum damage with both dice, instead of rolling them.

**Favored Foe.** When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on your mystical bond with nature to mark the target as your favored enemy for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The first time on each of your turns that you hit the favored enemy and deal damage to it, including when you mark it, you can increase that damage by 1d6. You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Colossus Slayer.** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if itâ€™s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

**Indomitable.** You can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

**Canny.** Your proficiency check is doubled for any ability check you make that uses Investigation or Perception.

#### Actions

**Multiattack.** You can make two attacks in one action.

**Second Wind.** You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

**Action Surge.** You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

#### Equipment

*Marshal's cloak*

*breastplate +2*

*bracers of defense +2*

*battle axe +1* (additional powers?)

*Marshal's token*

-------

Jannon Urlithian is a grizzled old minotaur who's served as one of the Marshals of Yithi for most of his adult life. His particular use in the Marshals is as a bounty hunter, tracking certain individuals down and rendering justice, though the justice in question often varies from one situation to the next--he is no stranger to carrying out summary execution, but his preference is to bring criminals back for trial, and if that seems unlikely, convince them to take their activities outside of Yithi entirely.

Jannon will not accompany the PCs on any mission or quest, but can be a source of support and authority if he feels it necessary. He has several letters of credit that are good anywhere in Yithi for monetary value (100gp, 500gp, 1000gp denominations) as well as a few letters of credit good for some common consumable magic items (in particular healing potions).
