# Kedren Shank
*male humanoid (half-orc) Rogue (Swashbuckler) 5, NG*

## Description
Kedren Shank is a dark-haired half-orc in his fifties, graying at the temples but still hearty, strong, sharp, and powerful. He is very quiet, however, and generally will not speak his mind unless specifically asked by someone he trusts. He is slowly growing a deeper friendship with [Lars Ulverth](LarsUlverth.md), despite their very different backgrounds.

Kedren Shank was one of those nameless bandits who came to eventually lead his own band of thieves, pludering mercenary convoys along the Dawn Way, until about thirty years ago, when the [Lions of Brinwal](/Cities/Brinwal.md) caught him and his band in an ambush, convinced most of them to surrender, and put them on trial. Offered the chance to rehabilitate himself by [Lord Jarmaath](KerdenJarmaath.md), Shank chose to take it, and after ten years in the Brinwal jail, he emerged, ready to take a meaningful role in society. Shunned at first by the locals, Shank chose to focus his talents on something he knew well--weapons--and slowly built a smithy that turned out high-quality arms and armor. Jarmaath himself wields a Shank blade, and many of the very same Lions that jailed him now frequent his shop for upkeep and upgrades to their equipment.

Shank is well aware that [Rillor Paln](RillorPaln.md) is the Nightmaster of the Black Knives in Brinwal, and has recently come to the conclusion that the Black Knives need to be curtailed. He is still figuring out what to do about it, but it will likely involve working with Ulverth and the Lions to ambush various Black Knives activity around town.
