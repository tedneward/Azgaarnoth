# Lord Torshon [Ciallin](../Organizations/Houses/Ciallin.md), Baron Stagraven
A young man just recently elevated to his seat, Torshon Ciallin fancies himself a dashing swordsman, and spent many years in the Stagraven dueling scene, seeking to master his command of rapier and artful flourish. In a duel a few years ago, however, just before his marriage and ascension, he nearly lost his life to a badly-misjudged opponent, and it sobered his outlook on life and brought many of his chaotic tendencies under a more lawful bent. He is still prone to act the dashing swordsman at times, but he now has a much deeper appreciation for those who are professionals at war, and those who only play at it.

His wife, Marissa (Human Female, LG) is originaly of [House Elhol](../Organizations/Houses/Elhol.md), and it was a combination of her House's influence and her resolute desire to do well by her marriage that propelled Torshon into the baronial seat. They have no children as of yet, which after five years of marriage is the subject of much speculation and rumor.

#### Description
As the Baron Stagraven, Torshon is typically accompanied by a retinue of advisors and guards, and rarely journies anywhere entirely alone. Before his ascension to the Baronial Seat, he was a frequent visitor and participant in Stagraven's various dueling colleges, but since his acceptance of the Seat has instead sought duelist challenges on Baronial grounds in more informal settings.

***Race: Human.*** Humans were the servant race of the Eldar and flourished and took over much of the lands after the Fall. It is not clear if humans were created by the Eldar, or were uplifted by them. Either way, humans owe their civilization to the initial one built by the Eldar, inheriting it after the Fall.

***Feat: Dual Wielder.*** You have mastered fighting with two weapons.

***Class: Fighter.*** Fighters share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. They are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

***Martial Archetype: Duelist.*** The duelist lives for the thrill of combat, but most of all, they thrive in seeking out and challenging the most skilled foe on any battlefield. Once a duelist engages with their latest nemesis, everything else fades into oblivion, forgotten in the moment. The dance of the duel offers them the best way to learn new tricks, hone combat skills, andâ€”most importantly--solidify their reputation as the superior swordsman.

***Feat: Alert.*** You are always on the lookout for danger.
