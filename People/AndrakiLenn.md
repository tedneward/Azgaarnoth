# Andraki Lenn
*male halfling (lightfoot) Commoner 5, LN*

## Description
Andraki Lenn is one of the few halflings whose view of the world is not the stereotypical happy-go-lucky come-what-will approach to life; although he may have started that way as a young halfling, as a middle-aged proprietor of an inn of fine quality in [Brinwal](/Cities/Brinwal.md), Lenn is now firmly on the side of "law and order", with particular emphasis on the part of "order" that involves following the rules he's firmly established for his inn: Conversation must be polite, decorum maintained, and enjoyment in moderation. Lenn is a gourmand of quite some skill, and the dishes he puts out in front of his customers range from "great" to "sublime". He also pays a stipend to the Lions of Brinwal to keep a small squad of 2-3 Lions in the inn on a regular basis--and given that the Lions eat for free (but must still buy their drinks) during their time there, it is a duty highly prized among the Lions.
