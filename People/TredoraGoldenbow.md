**Celestial Resistance**. You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage.

**Healing Hands**. As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Light Bearer**. You know the [light](https://github.com/tedneward/Azgaarnoth/blob/master/Magic/Spells/light.md) cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

**Warding Flare**. You can interpose divine light between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Channel Divinity**: You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with three such effects: Turn Undead, Harness Divine Power, and Radiance of the Dawn. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. You can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

* **Turn Undead** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

* **Harness Divine Power** Starting at 2nd level, you can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended 1st-level spell slot.

* **Radiance of the Dawn** Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

**Improved Flare** Starting at 6th level, you can also use your Warding Flare feature when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a creature other than you.

**Shield Mastery** You use shields not just for protection but also for offense. You gain the following benefits while you are wielding a shield:

* If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to try to shove a creature within 5 feet of you with your shield.
* If you aren't incapacitated, you can add your shield's AC bonus to any Dexterity saving throw you make against a spell or other harmful effect that targets only you.
* If you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can use your reaction to take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, interposing your shield between yourself and the source of the effect.

**Potent Spellcasting** You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

**Spellcasting.** Spell attack modifier: +8. Spell save DC (Wisdom): 16.
