# Captain Lars [Ulverth](/Organizations/Houses/Ulverth.md)
*Human male Fighter (Cavalier) 7/Leader 2, LG*



## Description
A powerfully-built man in his mid-40s, but still extremely quick and strong--age may have touched the hair at his temples, but it hasn't come anywhere close to his arms or his sword. He speaks slowly, methodically, and is not prone to outbursts.

Captain of the Guard, the Lions of Brinwal, in [Brinwal](/Cities/Brinwal.md). 

A distant relative of [House Ulverth](/Organizations/Houses/Ulverth.md).

Ulverth is very loyal to his Lord ([Kedren Jarmaath](KedrenJarmaath.md)), his city ([Brinwal](/Cities/Brinwal.md)), and his Guard, in that order. He enforces the law in Brinwal fairly, and tries to ensure the common citizens of Brinwal are safe from the predations of either the monsters in the Witchwood or the nobility of Brinwal. He has great respect for Jaarmath, whom he thinks of as a younger brother or son, and will lay down his life to protect him.
