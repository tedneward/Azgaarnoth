**Residence:** [Brinwal](../Cities/Brinwal.md)

Arbur is a young dragonborn, passionate, and rash to action. He is one of those few dragonborn who doesn't know his parents, having been raised by the Order since he was a baby. He is fiercely devoted the Order, and having recently been promoted to this position, seeks to ensure that the Order's goals and aims are upheld--even if he must use tools that defy those goals and aims to accomplish them.

#### Description
In his capacity as a Talon Leader, he assists with the Lions of Brinwal's duties, including investigating various criminal activities that are not within the Guards' jurisdiction to investigate. His Talon is normally made up of a half-dozen Copper Knights (fighters and rogues), two Silver Knights (one cleric, one paladin), and himself. His orders are more around intelligence-gathering and keeping an ear to the ground for activites to the west (for activity out of either eastern Travenia or the Wyrmsmoke Mountains), rather than any particular martial activities, though his Knights are certainly capable of combat.

***Race: Dragonborn.*** 

***Copper Dragonborn.***

***Class: Rogue.*** Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.

***Roguish Archetype: Arcane Trickster.*** Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers.
