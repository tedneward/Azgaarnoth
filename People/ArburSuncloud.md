# Talon Arbur Suncloud
*chaotic good male dragonborn (copper) rogue (Arcane Trickster) 4*

**Title:** Talon, [Order of the Copper Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/Copper.md)

**Residence:** [Brinwal](/Cities/Brinwal.md)

## Description
Arbur is a young dragonborn, passionate, and rash to action. He is one of those few dragonborn who doesn't know his parents, having been raised by the Order since he was a baby. He is fiercely devoted the Order, and having recently been promoted to this position, seeks to ensure that the Order's goals and aims are upheld--even if he must use tools that defy those goals and aims to accomplish them. Having just been posted here, his first command, he is fiercely devoted to the defense of "his" city, and is fully prepared to use his Talon as necessary to defend the city as he sees necessary.

In his capacity as a Talon Leader, he assists with the Lions of Brinwal's duties, including investigating various criminal activities that are not within the Guards' jurisdiction to investigate. His Talon is normally made up of a half-dozen Copper Knights (fighters and rogues), two Silver Knights (one cleric, one paladin), and himself. His orders are more around intelligence-gathering and keeping an ear to the ground for activites to the west (for activity out of either eastern Travenia or the Wyrmsmoke Mountains), rather than any particular martial activities, though his Knights are certainly capable of combat.
