*Human male Fighter 2*

## Description
Hurndahl Teskerwill is the second child of [Owen](OwenTeskerwill.md), and has taken some basic martial training as part of his childhood, but has found himself at something of a loss as to what he wants to do; he doesn't stand to inherit, military activities don't particularly engage him, and the priesthood holds no real appeal. If anything, he enjoys music and performance, but isn't sure if he wants to itinerant lifestyle of a bard or troubador.
