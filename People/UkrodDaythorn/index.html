<h1 id="village-councilor-ukrod-daythorn">Village Councilor Ukrod Daythorn</h1>
<p>Ukrod is a village councilor in the village of Tiborec, off the southeastern coast of Yithi, along the coast who appears to make his living as a farmer landlord, charging modest rates to farmers who work the land for him. In secret, he is the Guildmaster of a Rogues' Guild (the <a href="../../Organizations/RoguesGuilds/TradersoftheSleepyBoat/">Traders of the Sleepy Boat</a>) that operates in <a href="../Cities/Overoslugry.md">Overoslugry</a> and <a href="../Cities/Ghaulanejasti.md">Ghaulanejasti</a>, residing here mostly for its isolation and relative safety. Periodically he takes trips to those two cities to touch base with his operations, using a small sailboat he has beached on the northern part of the island.</p>
<p>Ukrod is a patient, meticulous planner, and will not act in haste. He has numerous escape routes planned, and has contacts all over the Ghaulan Sound. He is comfortable with his position, and will not take unnecessary risks in the name of naked ambition, but will defend that position fiercely.</p>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>Ukrod is a middle-aged half-orc of no clear ancestry, beyond the (relatively small) distinctive tusks that mark orcish blood and the fair-haired mane that marks humanity. Unlike many half-orcs, he is not particularly impressive as a physical specimen--in fact, some might call him scrawny. (Many have, directly to his face, in fact.) His demeanor is reserved, often diffident, and he is often seen without visible weapons. His speech is smooth, however, and where his intellect is slightly above-average, he periodically shows a flash of insight that has--over time--earned him respect enough from his fellow villagers to earn a seat on the Tiborec Village Council. He often keeps to himself, sailing on his boat periodically, sometimes to fish, sometimes to think, and sometimes to one of the larger cities along the coast to engage in a small bit of trade. He is often generous on these mercantile trips, often bringing sweets or gifts to the children of the village, but nothing ostentatious. Villagers of Tiborec see Ukrod as quiet and kind, if a bit odd for his lonesome lifestyle. Few can remember when he arrived on Tiborec, though they do know he came with a small amount of coin (enough to buy out a few farmsteads, which he rents out). Fewer still can put a finger on what he does besides rent out the farmland, but his modest and quiet lifestyle has generally earned the respect and acceptance of the village as a whole.  </p>
<p><strong><em>A Tragic History.</em></strong> Ukrod's innocent-landlord cover is a well-practiced habit; as a young half-orc, the whelp of a human mercenary and an orcish wench, Ukrod's background is one entirely dominated by the streets of urban poverty. Abandoned before birth by his father, abandoned shortly after he could walk by his mother, Ukrod found living on the streets harsh, despite his orcish constitution, and never really achieved his full build. Instead, he found he had a gift for planning and cunning, and before long had a gang of fellow urchins surrounding him, carrying out his plans and schemes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Opportunity Knocks.</em></strong> His graduation to a full-fledged Rogues' Guild came a few years after his "gang"'s formation, the day the urchins accidentally crossed the line into stealing from a merchant protected by the Sleepy Boat guild. The Guildmaster, impressed by the levels of indirection Ukrod had built around the urchins' existence, offered Ukrod the chance to elevate his game, which Ukrod quickly accepted. Ukrod would plan heists and cons, the Guildmaster would oversee them, and the Sleepy Boat guild profited immensely. Despite several attempts by ambitious underlings and rivals to convice Ukrod to betray the Guildmaster, Ukrod stayed faithful, mostly out of a realization around the mutual beneificence of their partnership.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ascension.</em></strong> When the Guildmaster was poisoned by a rival Guild, Ukrod stepped back from the Guildmaster's chair, allowing rivals to maneuver and connive. Quietly, he continued the work of the Guild while the coups and counter-coups took place, until a few weeks later, rivals were exhausted with no clear victor. Ukrod, however, continued to run the schemes and heists for the Guild, still refusing to accept the title of "Guildmaster" until a year to the day after the Guildmaster's poisoning, by which time the rest of the Guild had come to realize Ukrod was by far and away the best Guildmaster they could have. Three of the principal rivals agreed to set aside their differences ("for now") and back Ukrod, each with the hidden agenda of conspiring to overthrow him at a more convenient time. Within the year, all three were dead by "accidents", and Ukrod's control over the Guild was complete. His first task within the month was to exact revenge on the rival Guildmaster who ordered the poisoning, framing one of the lieutenants within that Guild and stirring up an internal conflict, after which the Sleepy Boat guild absorbed the remnants.</p>
<p><strong><em>Race: Half-Orc.</em></strong> When alliances between humans and orcs are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs, savage fury, and impressive cunning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Class: Rogue.</em></strong> Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p>
