# Natalie Nettlemead
*female halfling (lightfoot) Cleric (Fertility) 6 of Yondalla, LG*

## Description
Natalie is the Mother of a church of Yondalla in [Brinwal](/Cities/Brinwal.md). She is firmly devoted to the lives of her temple's population, the lives of the city as a whole, and the principles of Yondalla. If, during a crisis, she is forced to choose between helping the population and standing down the cause of the crisis, she will choose the population every time: "Plenty of people choose to be heroes, I choose to be the healer instead."
