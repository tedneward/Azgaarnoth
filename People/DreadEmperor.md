# The Dread Emperor / Emperor of [Dradehalia](../Nations/Dradehalia.md)
The Dread Emperor is a figure marked by deep mystery, enshrouded in an enigma, and buried in controversy. Some see him as a figure to be envied and admired for his single-minded obsession with the preservation of his people; others see him as perpetrating the very evil he purports to fight; still others see him as a tragic figure, one that has lost his way in his fervent effort to do good and instead now harms the very ones he sought to save. Whatever the perception, however, the fact remains that in the south, the Dread Emperor rules, and the conflict between [Dradehalia](../Nations/Dradehalia.md) and the [Ulmhorde](../Nations/Ulmhorde.md) wages fiercely with no end in sight, even as the Dread Emperor sets his sights to the west and north.
