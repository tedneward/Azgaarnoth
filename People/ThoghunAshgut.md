# Thoghun Ashgut
*female elf (mountain) Fighter (Samurai) 15, LG*

## Description
Duelmaster of the Ashgut Dueling School in [Stagraven](/Cities/Stagraven.md).

Her name, a dwarven one, is an interesting story--Thoghun was adopted as a baby by a dwarf family after her family's village in Bagonbia was attacked and razed by a band of gnolls. She reveres dwarven traditions, and while she clearly recognizes she does not share dwarven genetics, she is fiercely devoted to her adopted family and their extended kin.
