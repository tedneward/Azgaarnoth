# Yithi
*Historical figure; minotaur paladin (Oath of Conquest) 17, lawful neutral*





A charismatic minotaur named Yithi, the tribes that remained chose instead to look for ways to improve themselves and their lives and create a civilization of their own that didn't rely on constnat warfare. He first gathered five tribes to meet with his, and on the shores of Lake Venerinat, they signed the Pact of the Five Nations that bound their tribes to his guidance and wisdom, with the explicit intent to unify all of the tribes in the former Hordes lands, to find a better life.

Over the next several hundred years, Yithi and his Five Nations ruthlessly crushed opposition to that dream. Tribes could either join with the growing nation, flee for other shores, or be exterminated. Legend says numerous tribes chose the latter, but many more chose the former, and some few chose to flee for lands to the south. (Several tribes sought an even more pacifistic lifestyle, fled north to join Yithi's spiritual advisers there, and together they founded [Zhi](../Nations/Zhi.md).)

By the time Yithi lay on his deathbed in his tent, the nation he sought to create was largely built, its governing structure established, and the traditions of the new life he sought established. In his honor, the first Prince and his Council chose to name themselves after him, swore to honor him and his vision, and firmly set the nation on the path down which it follows even to this day.
