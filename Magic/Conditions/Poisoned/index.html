<h1 id="condition-poisoned">Condition: Poisoned</h1>
<p>Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins and evil creatures such as drow.</p>
<p>Poisons come in the following four types.</p>
<p><strong><em>Contact.</em></strong> Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ingested.</em></strong> A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be de足livered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p>
<p><strong><em>Inhaled.</em></strong> These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or re足leasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately after足 ward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p>
<p><strong><em>Injury.</em></strong> Injury poison can be applied to weapons, am足 munition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.</p>
<p>Poisons are anywhere from common to legendary in terms of accessibility:</p>
<p><strong><em>Common.</em></strong> Common poisons can be found in the supplies of most apothecaries and alchemists, though they are unlikely to reveal such poisons except to customers that can show they won't spread word of such sales. Customers that speak in Thieves' Cant are usually able to acquire these poisons with ease. Common poisons can also be found in most wilderness environments with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Nature) check and several hours of searching.</p>
<p><strong><em>Uncommon.</em></strong> Uncommon poisons can be found in the inventories of most wealthy or unscrupulous apothecaries, alchemists, and death-dealers in major cities. These poisons are not easy to craft, and their ingredients are difficult to obtain. They are usually quite illegal in most societies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rare.</em></strong> Rare poisons can be found in the inventories of only the most capable or nefarious apothecaries and alchemists. Some merchants who specialize in the procurement of magic items have been known to carry rare poisons, but they do not advertise such wares except to customers who have demonstrated their discretion. Rare poisons can be found in certain areas of the wilderness, where danger lurks for those who would harvest them. These poisons are highly illegal in societies that know of them, but many civilizations are not aware of their existence.</p>
<p><strong><em>Very Rare.</em></strong> Very rare poisons can be found among the wares of the various immortal collectors that inhabit the Feywild, the Shadowfell, and the Outer Planes. Mortal civilizations of the Material Plane rarely even discover the existence of most of these poisons. They use ingredients that are extremely dangerous to procure, and only those with access to the forbidden knowledge lost in ancient tombs and forgotten ruins might learn how to craft them or how to identify these poisons in the wild.</p>
<p><strong><em>Legendary.</em></strong> Legendary poisons can only be found in the most deadly and extreme locales, and only with a legendary amount of luck on one's side. Crafting them is nearly impossible, but legends speak of once-in-a-generation alchemists who were able to manage such feats.</p>
