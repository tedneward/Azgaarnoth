A swirling coil of fierce wind rises around one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 5d8 bludgeoning damage, you can choose push it up to 15 feet in any direction, and if the target is Huge or smaller, it is thrown 30 feet up into the air. It remains aloft until the end of your next turn, at which point it falls unless it can stop the fall. While held aloft by this spell, a creature is restrained if it cannot fly.

On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage and isn't pushed or launched into the air.
