#### Inevitable Wave
*Enchantment cantrip* (Artificer,Bard,Cleric,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
the target, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the
target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it has
disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes for an
opportunity attack before the start of your next
turn.
If you moved at least 10 feet in a straight line
towards the target immediately before casting this
spell, your weapon attack inflicts an additional 1d4
force damage on a hit, and your allies are
psychically inspired to charge the same foe with the
relentless force of the incoming tide. Until the start
of your next turn, the first time each turn that an
ally hits the target with a melee weapon attack, if
that ally moved at least 10 feet in a straight line
immediately before making that attack, the target
takes additional psychic damage equal to your
spellcating ability modifier.
The extra force damage inflicted by your initial
attack for this spell increases by 1d4 when you reach
5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
The psychic damage does not increase.
