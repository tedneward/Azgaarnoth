#### Death Spell
*6th-level necromancy* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a string of finger bones)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Designate a 20-foot radius circle within range.
Ghostly, skeletal hands reach out of the ground,
clawing at everyone within the circle. Choose one
creature in the spell area, which must then make a
Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell
ends. If it fails, it takes necrotic damage, as per the
following instructions.
Roll 10d10. If the total is less than the creature's
current hit points, it takes the total result as
necrotic damage and the spell ends. If the total roll
exceeds the creature's current hit points, it takes
damage equal to its current hit points and dies, and
the remaining damage moves on to another
creature of your choice, which must also make a
Constitution saving throw, as above. Continue repeating this process until the damage
is exhausted, or someone successfully saves and
ends the spell. This spell does not affect the undead.
