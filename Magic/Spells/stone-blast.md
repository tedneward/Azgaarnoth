#### Stone Blast
*1st-level transmutation* (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 60 feet 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 
---
You summon a group of large stones from a space next to a surface within range that you can see, like a floor, walL or ceiling. The surface doesn't have to be made of a single contiguous material but it must be mostly made of earth, sand, stone, metaL crystal or another suitable earthen or stone-like materiaL and it must be at least 3 inches deep, or else the spell fails.

When the stones appear from the surface, you make two spell attacks, magically hurling the stones at targets you can see within 60 feet of the stones' location. Each attack deals 2d6 nonmagical bludgeoning damage on a hit. You may choose a different target or the same target for any of the attacks, but all targets must be within 30 feet of each other.

The spell attacks you make with this spell determine cover and line of effect as if they were made from the location where the stones were summoned instead of your location, and they ignore disadvantage caused by a target being prone. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you make one additional attack with the stones for each slot level above 1st.
