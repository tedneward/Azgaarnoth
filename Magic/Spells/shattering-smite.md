Your weapon hums with a low rumbling as destructive vibrations reverberate throughout it. The next time you hit a creature or object with a melee weapon attack during this spellâ€™s duration, the attack deals an extra 3d8 thunder damage, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes another 3d8 thunder damage, and half that damage on a successful save. If you hit an unattended, nonmagical object or a creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal, it takes double damage. If your target is a structure, you damage a portion of the structure throughout an area up to a 15-foot cube.
