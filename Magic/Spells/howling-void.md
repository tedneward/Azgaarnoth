You destroy the air in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range, creating an unseen magical area of vacuum that spreads around corners and lasts until the spell ends. No sound can be created within or pass through the area, and nonmagical flight in the area is impossible. The area disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes nonmagical fires of any size. Any creature or object entirely inside the area is immune to thunder damage, is deafened, and cannot breathe or speak.

Any creature inside the area when it first appears or that ends its turn within the area must make a ConstiÂ­tution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 3d8 thunder damage and 3d8 psychic damage and gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half damage and does not gain any levels of exhaustion.

The damage dealt by this spell ignores resistance and immunity to thunder damage, but not resistance or immunity to all damage. Creatures that are immune to exhaustion are also immune to the psychic damage dealt by this spell 

When a creature ends its turn outside the area, it reduces any exhaustion caused by this spell by one level.
