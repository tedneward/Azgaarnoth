# Whimsybloom
*Illusion cantrip* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a flower petal)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a point of bare earth within range that you can see. An illusory flower grows from the earth and blossoms at the point that you choose. The Whimsybloom can resemble a real flower species, but it does not have to. It can be any color that you want it to be, including colors that donâ€™t commonly or naturally occur in flowers. As part of the illusion, you can choose one of the following effects to add to the illusory flower:

* The Whimsybloom hums a melodious tune at a pleasant volume

* The Whimsybloom has a faint glow around it, in any color that you choose

* The Whimsybloom emits a pleasant odor in all directions in a 5-foot radius around it

* The Whimsybloom seems to dance, sway, or move in a slow manner for the duration of the spell 

If a creature uses its action to examine the Whimsybloom, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.
