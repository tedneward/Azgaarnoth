#### Oppressive Cold
*1st-level enchantment* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You overwhelm a creature with debilitating cold. 
Choose a creature you can see within range to make
a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, that 
creature is affected for the duration. A creature with
resistance to cold damage has advantage on this 
saving throw, and a creature with immunity to cold 
damage is unaffected by the spell.

An affected creature's speed is halved, it can't take 
reactions, and it has disadvantage on weapon attacks
and Dexterity saving throws. The creature also gains 
vulnerability to fire damage, but ceases to be 
affected by this spell after taking any fire damage.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end 
of each of its turns. On a success, that creature is no 
longer affected by the spell. On a failure, the 
creature takes 1d6 cold damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one 
additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
