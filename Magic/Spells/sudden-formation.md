You bark a few seemingly simple commands, but
they are imbued with the majesty of past warlords.
Choose up to seven creatures you can see within
range that can hear you when you cast this spell.
After you choose these creatures, you can
immediately move up to half your speed. Once you
end this movement, each creatures you chose can
use its reaction to move up to its speed without
provoking opportunity attacks. A creature which
moves in this way must end its movement within 5
feet of you.
