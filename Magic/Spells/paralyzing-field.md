You cause a 10-foot radius paralytic field to form at
a point you see within range. A creature that starts
its turn within the field must make a Wisdom
saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its
next turn. On a successful save, the creature is
unaffected that turn.

a spell slot of 9th level, the radius of the paralytic
field increases to 20 feet.
