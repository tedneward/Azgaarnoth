___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
one creature within the spell's range, otherwise, the
spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's
normal effects, and you instantly teleport 5 feet to
an unoccupied space you can see that is farther
away from the target than you are now. The spell
ends if no unoccupied space within 5 feet fulfills all
these requirements.
If you teleport successfully, you magically compel
the target to move closer to you, pulling it up to 5
feet in a straight line toward you. It takes 1d6
psychic damage if it ends this movement within 5
feet of you.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an
extra 1d6 force damage to the target, and the
psychic damage the target takes for moving
increases to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6
at 11th level and 17th level.
