You create a 20 foot by 20 foot screen or a
hemisphere 20 feet in diameter. The screen is made
of pure energy, one of the colors of the rainbow.
The effect of the spell depends on the color:
Red. Any creature that comes into contact with
the screen must make a Wisdom save. The target
takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save and half as
much on a successful one.
Orange.  Any creature that comes into contact
with the screen must make a Wisdom save. The
target takes 8d8 fire damage on a failed save and
half as much on a successful one.
Yellow. Any creature that comes into contact with the screen must make a Wisdom save. The
target takes 8d8 thunder damage on a failed save
and half as much on a successful one.
Green. Any creature that comes into contact with
the screen is the target of a dispel magic. Treat it as
if it was cast by the caster as a third level spell.
Blue. Any creature that comes into contact with
the screen must make a Wisdom save. The target
takes 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save and half
as much on a successful one.
Indigo. Any undead that comes into contact with
the screen must make a Wisdom save. That undead
takes 4d8 radiant damage on a failed save, and is
stunned for one round. If the undead saves it takes
half as much damage, and is not stunned.
Violet. Any creature that comes into contact with
the screen is the target of a remove curse. Treat it as
if it was cast by the caster as a third level spell.
You can change the color of the screen as a bonus
action.
