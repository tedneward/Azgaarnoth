*3rd-level abjuration* (Cleric,Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure a small area of whirling air that
occupies a 5-foot radius sphere centered on a point
you choose within range. The swirling air forms a
shield that blocks acid, cold, fire, lightning, and
thunder damage. The shield attracts all elemental
discharges and neutralizes them, granting all
creatures within a 30-foot radius from its center
immunity to the listed damage types. However, the
shield's immunity is limited. If the shield reduces
damage a creature would take to 0, the spell ends if
it is not the first time that the shield has reduced
damage that particular creature would have taken
to 0 since this spell was cast.
