*9th-level conjuration* (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 1 mile
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
With a gesture, you cause a glacial mountain of ice
to erupt from the ground at a point you choose 
within range. The mountain is 200 feet high at the 
peak, with jagged slopes down to a roughly circular 
base with a radius of 100 feet.

The mountain rises to its full height almost 
immediately, likely with catastrophic results for any 
structures on or above the ground where the spell 
takes effect. A flying creature where the mountain 
appears must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 
10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as
much damage on a successful one. A non-flying 
creature within the area takes 5d10 bludgeoning 
damage and is abruptly tossed 50 feet in the air 
above the mountain.

The entire mountain is made of ice, and is 
therefore subject to melting and other natural forces
as normal, leaving behind a 1-foot-deep crater if 
entirely removed.
