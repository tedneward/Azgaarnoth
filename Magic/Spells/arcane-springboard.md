You infuse a section of the ground with arcane energy, creating a bouncy surface that launches any who step on it in the desired direction. Choose a 5-foot cube within range. Until the spell ends, any creature who sets foot on a surface within that area can immediately use its reaction to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump. The creature's jump distance for that check is multiplied by 5. If a creature makes this jump during its turn, it can choose to do so a bonus action instead of using its reaction.
