#### Prismatic Surge
*5th-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Eight different colors of light swirl around your hand. At any given moment one or two of those colors becomes dominant until it quickly shifts towards another of the eight colors. You can make a melee spell attack against a creature using the hand with colors swirling around it. On a hit, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. Roll 1d8 to determine which color(s) was dominant when you hit the creature:

1. Red. Deals 8d6 fire damage to the creature on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.
2. Orange. Deals 8d6 acid damage to the creature on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.
3. Y ellow. Deals 8d6 lightning damage to the creature on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.
4. Green. Deals 8d6 poison damage to the creature on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.
5. Blue. Deals 8d6 cold damage to the creature on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.
6. Indigo. The target is restrained on a failed save, and must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns. Three successful saves end the spell. Three failed saves result in the target turning to stone permanently and being subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures donâ€™t need to be consecutive.
7. Violet. The target is blinded on a failed save, and must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness while a failed save transports the creature to another plane of existence and also ends the blindness. (If the creature was not on its home plane, it will typically be banished home, while other creatures will be sent to the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
8. Special. Two colors were dominant in the surge. Roll 1d8 twice, rerolling any roll of 8 or the same color (re-roll just one of the dice if two dice were rolled at the same time). The same Constitution save result applies to both colors rolled.
