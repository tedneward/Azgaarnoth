#### March of Blades
*4th-level conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 30 feet 
- **Components:** V, S, M (any bladed weapon) 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 
---
You conjure a row of synchronized floating blades made of magical energy in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. The line extends in any direction and originates from any point you can see within range. The blades slash in a wide arc as they appear, forcing each creature in the area to make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3dl0 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. 

The blades provide half-cover to creatures behind them. You can use a bonus action on subsequent turns to move one or both ends of the line to different locations up to 30 feet away that you can see. When you finish moving the area in this way on a turn, you may choose to have the blades slash again, forcing all creatures in the area to repeat the Dexterity saving throw. 

The blades last until the spell ends, at which point they vanish. If at any time you aren't within range of at least one end of the line, the spell ends. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the slashing damage dealt increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
