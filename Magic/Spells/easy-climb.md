As you cast this spell, select a vertical surface within range, such as a cliff face, tree trunk, or similar surface. Small handholds and footholds appear on the surface, up to the spell's range. For the duration, all creatures who make Strength (Athletics) checks to climb the affected surface do so with advantage.
