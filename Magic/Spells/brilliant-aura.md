When you cast this spell, the weapons of all creatures of your choice within range glow with radiant energy for the duration. An affected weapon sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius, deals radiant damage instead of its normal damage type, and ignores non-living material, causing attacks with the affected weapon against creatures wearing armor or using shields to be made with advantage. In addition, undead creatures are considered vulnerable to the damage caused by a weapon affected by this spell. Constructs, however, gain resistance to the damage of these weapons.
