#### Magnet Pull
*1st-level evocation* (Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You create an electrical imbalance to generate a 
magnetic pull. Choose a metal object that weighs no 
more than 20 pounds. If the object is not being worn
or carried and is not otherwise restrained, it flies 
toward you where you can either catch it or let it 
fall at your feet. If the target is fastened to a solid 
surface or otherwise prevented from moving, it may 
be possible to pull it free with an ability check using 
your spellcasting ability, at the DM's discretion.

If the targeted object is being carried, the wielder 
must make a Dexterity save or have the object 
pulled from its grasp and fly toward you as 
described above. If the object is being worn (such as 
one of the plates of a suit of armor), the wearer 
must instead make a Strength saving throw or be 
pulled 15 feet toward you.

Alternatively, you can target a creature that is 
made largely of metal (such as an iron golem). Such 
a creature is affected in the same way as a creature 
wearing a targeted object, as described above.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the weight of the 
object you can target increases by 20 pounds for 
each slot level above 1st.
