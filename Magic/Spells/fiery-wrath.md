- **Components:** S, M (a candlewick)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You create fire with only the concentrated power of your inner rage. Choose any flammable object within range. If it is not on someone's person, it suddenly bursts into flames. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the fire exploded must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or 1 point of fire damage on a successful one.

You then choose one creature within the affected area and make a ranged spell attack against the creature. On a hit, that creature takes 1d6 psychic damage and must choose to either immediately fall prone or take an additional 1d6 fire damage at the beginning of their next turn.

If a creature has the flammable object you ignite on their person, you must make the ranged spell attack for this spell first, and you must make the attack against the creature with object on their person. If you hit, it suffers the same effects from your ranged spell attack described above, and the object bursts into flames. Each creature within 5 feet of the ignited object must then make the
Dexterity saving throw as normal.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
