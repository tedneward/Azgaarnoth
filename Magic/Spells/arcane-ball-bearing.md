# Arcane Ball Bearings
*3rd-level conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 150 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a single ball bearing)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A wave of glowing arcane ball bearings is flung in a 60-foot cone from a point you choose within range. The ball bearings pulse with an energy type of your choice from fire, lightning, or radiant. Creatures in the affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 damage of the damage type you chose on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the initial wave, the ball bearings cease dealing damage but remain in the area for 10 minutes before vanishing. Anytime a creature attempts to move in or through the area, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. Crawling creatures and those immune to the prone condition do not need to make this saving throw.
