#### Consume Flame
*5th-level transmutation* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You touch an open flame and extinguish it, 
absorbing its power. You gain temporary hit points 
based on the size and power of the fire. Touching a 
source of fire as part of this spell does not harm you.
If the consumed fire is a nonmagical flame the size
of a Medium creature or smaller, you gain 5 
temporary hit points. The number of temporary hit 
points gained increases by 5 for each size category 
above Medium.

If the consumed fire is an ongoing spell effect, 
then the spell ends and you gain a number of 
temporary hit points equal to 10 plus 5 per spell level
of the spell consumed.

You can also consume the heat from lava, cooling 
and hardening it in the process. You gain temporary 
hit points equal to the radius (in feet) of the area of 
lava cooled, up to a maximum radius of 30 feet.
