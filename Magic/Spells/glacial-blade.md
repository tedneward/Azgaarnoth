___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes encased in a sheath of ice until the start of your next turn. If the target uses its action to make a weapon attack, it immediately takes 1d8 cold damage, and the spell ends.

At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for making a weapon attack increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.
