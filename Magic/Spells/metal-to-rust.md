You reduce one metal object to a pile of rust. Choose one metal object within range that is Large or smaller. Make a ranged spell attack against the higher of either the AC of the item (19 for most metals, 21 for mithral, 23 for adamantine), or the AC of the one holding or carrying it (if it is being held or carried). If the object is not magical, you have advantage on the attack roll and score a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20. On a hit, the item takes necrotic damage equal to 6d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

If the chosen object is a magic item, the necrotic damage is determined by the item's rarity, as follows:

Rarity | Damage
------ | -------
Common | 5d8 + ability modifier
Uncommon | 4d8 + ability modifier
Rare | 3d8 + ability modifier
Very Rare | 2d8 + ability modifier
Legendary | 1d8 + ability modifier

Artifacts take no damage from this spell. Most magic items have resistance to all damage, and will therefore take half the indicated damage. If a magic item you target with this spell is sentient, you have disadvantage on your ranged spell attack against it.
