*2nd-level conjuration* (Artificer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure a shadowy duplicate of a foe that
assaults and harries the original. Choose a Medium-
size or smaller creature within range, then choose
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that creature.
A murderous twin of the target appears in the
chosen space, and makes a melee spell attack
against the target, using your spell attack modifier.
On a hit, the target takes 2d6 psychic damage and
has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes
before the end of its next turn.
The murderous twin lasts for the duration. While
it is within 5 feet of the target, the target has
disadvantage on all attack rolls for opportunity
attacks.
Until the spell ends, whenever the target makes
an attack roll, forces another creature to make a
saving throw, or ends its turn more than 5 feet away
from the murderous twin, you can use your reaction
you can cause the murderous twin to vanish. The
murderous twin then reappears in an unoccuped
space within 5 feet of the target, then repeats the
melee spell attack.
