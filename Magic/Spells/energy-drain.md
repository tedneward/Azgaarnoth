---
With a howl like the damned, several bolts of black
lightning leap from your target to you. You drain
away its life force and use it to power your own
magic. The target must make a Constitution saving
throw. The target takes 20d8 necrotic damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. In addition, its hit point maximum is reduced
by the amount of damage it takes. After a long rest,
the target's hit point maximum returns to normal.
For every 20 points of necrotic damage you inflict,
you regenerate a 1st-level spell slot. You can
combine spell slots to regenerate higher level spells.
For example, if you do 85 points of damage, you
could regenerate one 4th-level spell slot, four 1st-
level spell slots, or any combination that does not
exceed 4 spell levels.
