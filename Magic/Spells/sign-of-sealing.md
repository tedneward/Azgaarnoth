___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a crushed emerald worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Permanent
---
You seal a door, chest, book, or other object that
can be closed with a magical sigil that bars entry
and prevents opening. The protected object can
only be opened if broken, or with knock or dispel
magic. However, if the object is forced open by any
means (physical or magical), the sigil explodes in
30-foot radius for 10d4 force damage. A successful
Dexterity saving throw halves the damage.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the amount of
force damage increases by 1d4 per slot level above
3rd.
