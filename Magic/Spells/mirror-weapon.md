---
You touch a weapon and wrap it in an illusion that appears to create duplicates of the weapon when used. Until the spell ends, attacks made with the weapon have advantage except against creatures who don't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight. When the wielder hits with an attack using the weapon, the advantage isn't granted again until the start of the next turn.

***At Higher Levels.***When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the advantage is granted even after hitting with an attack on that turn.
