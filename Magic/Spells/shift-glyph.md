___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
All magical glyphs and symbols within range faintly
glow and can be safely read and identified if you are
familiar with them. In addition, you can select one
of the glyphs or symbols and move it safely to
another suitable surface within range without
triggering its effects.
This spell prevents the spellcaster from triggering
glyphs and symbols within range while maintaining
concentration but doesn't extend this protection to
other creatures that may trigger them.
