---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against a
creature within range, otherwise the spell fails. On a
miss, the spell ends. On a hit, the target suffers the
attack's normal effects, and the air shimmers
around you as an illusory duplicate of you appears
in an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet
of the target. If no such space exists, the spell fails.
Until the spell ends, the duplicate persists,
appearing to be a living, breathing, active version of
you. If the target ends its turn more than 60 feet
away from the duplicate, or if you end your turn
more than 60 feet away from the duplicate, the spell
ends. The duplicate mimics your actions to a
degree, but no matter where you are, it seeks to
remain close to the target.
If the target ends its turn more than 5 feet away
from the duplicate, the duplicate moves up to 60
feet to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the
target. If no such space exists, the duplicate moves
to the unoccupied space closest to the target.
While the duplicate is within 5 feet of the target,
you can make melee attacks against the target as if
it were within 5 feet of you, just as if you were
attacking from the space the duplicate is occupying.
If you hit the target with a melee attack roll while it
is within 5 feet of
the duplicate,
the attack inflicts
additional
psychic damage
equal to 1d6 +
your spellcasting
ability modifier.
While you are
within 5 feet of
your duplicate,
whenever an
attack roll is
made against
you, you can use
your reaction to
roll a d20. If you
roll an 11 or
higher on the
die, the attack
targets the
duplicate instead
of you.
The duplicate's
AC equals your spellcasting DC. If an attack hits a duplicate, the
duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed
only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other
damage and effects. If the duplicate is destroyed,
the spell ends.
