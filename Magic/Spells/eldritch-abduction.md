#### Eldritch Abduction
*3rd-level conjuration* (Ranger,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You teleport yourself up to 30 feet to an unoccupied
space that you can see. You can bring along objects
as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can
carry.
If you wish, you can also take one creature with
you when you cast this spell, provided that creature
is within 5 feet of you, it is Medium or smaller, and
it is not carrying gear in excess of its carrying
capacity.
When you take a creature with you, each of you
is teleported to an unoccupied space of your choice
within 30 feet. Your new space and that of the
creature you take with you must be within 5 feet of
each other. If either of you would arrive in a place
already occupied by an object or a creature, the
spell fails to teleport either of you.
If the other creature is not willing to be
teleported, it must roll a Charisma saving throw. On
a success, it is not teleported. A creature has
advantage on this saving throw if it can see you,
unless you are in combat with it and it has not yet
taken a turn.
When you use this spell to teleport another
creature, a loud popping sound emanates from that
creature's location when you first cast the spell,
followed by another loud popping sound that
emanates from the creature's new location when it
arrives. Both times, the sound is audible out to 100
feet.
