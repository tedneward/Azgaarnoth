You throw a set of glowing green bands at a Medium or smaller target within range. The target must make an opposed Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell attack roll. On a failure, the target is grappled by you while you maintain concentration on this spell. On each of its turns, the target can attempt to escape the grapple by succeeding on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your original spell attack roll.
