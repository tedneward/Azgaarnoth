This is one of the most reckless spells in the history of magic, researched by a mad mage who had been studying the unpredictable surges of wild magic sorcerers. You can not cast this spell while concentrating on a spell. When you cast this spell, roll on the sorcerer classâ€™ Wild Surge table. The effect that you rolled is activated by you. If you roll a result of 99-00, reroll the result unless you actually have expended sorcery points. If you cast this spell in a wild magic zone, roll twice instead for the wild surge and activate both results.
