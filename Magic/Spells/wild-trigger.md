#### Wild Trigger
*1st-level evocation* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You tap into magic without putting the usual constraints and restrictions around it, allowing it to roam freely for an instant.

When you cast this spell, it triggers a [wild magic surge](../Wild.md#wild-magic-surge). The effect that you rolled is activated by you. If you roll a result of 99-00, reroll the result unless you actually have expended sorcery points. If you cast this spell in a wild magic zone, roll twice instead for the wild surge and activate both results.

You can not cast this spell while concentrating on a spell. 

This is one of the most reckless spells in the history of magic, researched by a mad mage who had been studying the unpredictable surges of wild magic sorcerers.
