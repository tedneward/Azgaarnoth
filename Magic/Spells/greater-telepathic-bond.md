# Greater Telepathic Bond
*8th-level divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour

You forge a telepathic link with one willing creature of your choice within range. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this spell. The spell ends if you and the creature are ever on a different plane, or are more than one mile apart.

Until the spell ends, you and the creature can communicate telepathically through the bond, whether or not you share a common language. Additionally, you share each other’s senses, and any beneficial racial trait, spell, or effect that enhances the senses or perception of one creature, affects the other.

Finally, whenever you use your action to cast a spell, you can determine the spell’s range as though you were standing in the linked creature’s space. If you cast a spell with a range of self, you can have it affect you or the linked creature.
