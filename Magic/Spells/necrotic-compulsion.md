#### Necrotic Compulsion
*4th-level necromancy* (Cleric,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You briefly compel a wounded undead or other
creature infused with necrotic energies to aid in
your defense. Choose one creature you can see
within range that is below its hit point maximum. If
the target is not undead, it must have taken
necrotic damage since the start of your last turn.
The target must roll a Wisdom saving throw.
On a success, the target suffers disadvantage on its next attack roll
before the end of your
next turn. On a failure, you can pull
the target up to 30 feet closer to you and it is both
restrained and charmed by you until the end of your
next turn. Until then, any creature that ends its turn
within 5 feet of the target takes 4d6 necrotic
damage.
While it is charmed by you, the creature will not
attack you or seek to harm you, but otherwise it is
not forced to obey your commands.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the necrotic
damage inflicted increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 4th.
