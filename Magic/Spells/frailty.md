# Frailty
*9th-level necromancy* (Cleric, Druid, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (smoke and a turtle shell in a box)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your magic corrupts the health of one creature you can see within range. The target takes 8d6 necrotic damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target's exhaustion level is increased to 4 and can't be reduced below 4, and it has disadvantage on Constitution checks, Constitution saving throws, and death saving throws, all lasting for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails saves three times, it stops making saving throws against the spell. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the frailty becomes permanent. It can only be ended by [greater restoration](), [heal](), or [wish]() cast as a 9th-level spell.
