#### Disguised Blast
*1st-level illusion* (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 90 feet 
- **Components:** V, S, M (a glass eye) 
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 
---
You send a missile of magical force, camouflaged and disguised by illusion, hurtling at one creature that you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw, taking Sd4 force damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. 

A target automatically succeeds on its save against the spell if it doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or if it can see through illusions, as with truesight. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.
