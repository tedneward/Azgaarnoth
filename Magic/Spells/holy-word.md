#### Holy Word
*7th-level evocation* (Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You speak a word that holds holy power from one of the Outer Planes, power which corresponds strongly to certain ethical or moral alignments and inflicts extra damage against certain types of creatures. When you cast this spell, choose one of these four planes:

* **Elysium** (Good):  Aberrations, dragons (chromatic only), elementals, fiends, or undead.
* **Hades** (Evil):  Beasts, celestials, dragons (metallic only), humanoids, or plants.
* **Limbo** (Chaos):  Constructs, celestials (angels only), dragons, fiends (devils only), or giants.
* **Mechanus** (Law):  Aberrations, fiends (demons only), fey, monstrosities, oozes, or undead.

Creatures within 50 feet of you that are of the types listed for the chosen plane must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is frightened for 1 minute or, if it is immune to being frightened, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls against you for 1 minute instead. In addition, if a creature that failed its saving throw is not on its native plane, it is banished there, and cannot return for 1 hour. On a successful save, a creature isn't affected by this spell.

Your alignment (if you have one) may limit your choice of planar energies when you cast this spell. If you are evil-aligned, you cannot choose Elysium; if you are good-aligned, you cannot choose Hades, if you are lawful in alignment, you cannot choose Limbo; if your alignment is chaotic, you cannot choose Mechanus.
