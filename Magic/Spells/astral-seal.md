---
A flash of silver light streaks toward a creature of your choice you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target suffers 1d6 radiant damage, and you outline your enemy with the silver glow of the Astral Plane, exuding an energizing light that may aid an ally.

The next time an ally hits the target with an attack roll before the end of your next turn, that ally gains temporary hit points equal to half the radiant damage this spell inflicted. Creatures with 0 hit points and inanimate objects do not grant temporary hit points from this spell when they are struck.

***At Higher Levels.***  This spell's radiant damage increases when you reach higher levels, becoming 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.
