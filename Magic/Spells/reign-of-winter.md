You grip the area with an oppressive cold. At the time you cast the spell, all fires in the area—both magical and nonmagical—are instantly extinguished. New fires cannot be started in the area, and fires brought into the area are immediately extinguished. Fire damage cannot be dealt in the area.

Bodies of water within the area—including flowing water, such as a river or waterfall—are frozen solid. If a body of water extends beyond the spell's area, the portion of water within the area is frozen.

Whenever a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save. Any creature which does not have resistance or immunity to cold damage has their speed halved and cannot take reactions as long as they are in the area.

If a creature within the area casts a spell or uses an ability that includes fire damage, the entire spell or ability fails with no effect, and the creature must save against the spell as described above. A creature which fails the save in this way is blasted with retributive cold and is paralyzed until the end of their next turn.
