# Frost Armor
*3rd-level conjuration* (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Up to 1 minute

You touch a willing creature, encasing them in a protective coating of ice. For the duration, they gain a +3 bonus to AC and become resistant to cold damage but suffer disadvantage on all Dexterity checks and saves for the duration. Every time they are hit by a melee weapon attack, their attacker takes 1d6 cold damage.

Additionally, each time they are successfully attacked, the protection provided by frost armor wanes, reducing its armor class bonus by 1. After the AC bonus provided by the armor is reduced to 0, the armor shatters and the spell ends.
