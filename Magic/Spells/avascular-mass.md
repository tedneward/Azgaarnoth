- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You fire a blood red ray from your hand at a creature that you can see within range, causing blood to violently erupt from its pores, nose, mouth and eyes. The target must make Constitution save. On a failure, its hit points are reduced to half their current total and it is [poisoned](../../Conditions/Poisoned.md#arcanic-poison) until the start of your next turn.

If the initial target fails the Constitution save, blood and other bodily fluids ejected from the body form thick sticky tendrils of decomposing tissue. Anyone within 20 feet of the target must make a Strength saving throw or be [restrained](../../Conditions/Restrained.md) by these tendrils for the duration of the spell. The initial target is automatically restrained. A creature restrained by the spell can make a Strength save at the end of each of its turns, escaping on a success.

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
