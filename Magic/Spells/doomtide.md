#### Doomtide
*5th-level illusion* (Bard,Cleric,Warlock)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
This spell creates four 10-foot cubes of swirling
black mist, filled with grasping, shadowy tentacles.
You can choose which spaces the cubes occupy
within range, but at least 5 feet of each cube's outer
edge must be within or adjacent to another cube.
When you cast the spell, you choose whether the
mists are stationary, or move away from you at a
speed of 10 feet on each of your turns.
The area within the mists is heavily obscured,
even blocking darkvision beyond 5 feet. The area is
lightly obscured within 5 feet for creatures with
darkvision. Any creature that starts its turn within
the mists must make a successful Wisdom saving
throw, or be restrained by the shadowy tentacles. A
restrained creature can try a new saving throw to
escape at the end of each of its turns.
The mists can be dispersed within 4 rounds by
moderate winds, or within 1 round by a gust of wind
spell.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can create an
additional 10-foot cube of mists for each slot level
above 5th.
