# Analyze Blood
*2nd-level divination (ritual)* (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Pale Master, Ranger, Sorcerer)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (1 ounce of blood)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You are able to learn a number of qualities from one ounce of fresh blood, as long as it is not more than 24 hours old. Roll a d4 and choose a number of qualities to learn from the list below, equal to the die score:

* Learn the creature's type
* Learn the creature's age (if applicable)
* Learn the creature's gender (if applicable)
* Learn if the blood carries any traces of poison or disease
* Learn if the creature is within 20 miles of your location
* Learn if the creature is still on your plane of existence

If you cast this spell using a spell slot, in addition to the information learned above, you will also see a brief glimpse of the moment right before the creature shed blood, from its perspective.
