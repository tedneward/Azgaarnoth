---
With one stern, commanding word, you gesture to a
point on the ground within range, and the indicated
spot erupts in a shower of rock, dirt, and fire. Each
creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that
point takes 5d6 fire damage and must make a
Dexterity saving throw. A target that fails the saving
throw is knocked prone and takes additional
bludgeoning damage equal to the fire damage. The
fire also ignites flammable objects in the area that
aren't being worn or carried.
After the spell ends, the area of the spell becomes
difficult terrain until it is cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute
to clear by hand.

Earth-based or fire-based elemental creatures do
not take damage from this spell.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell
using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the fire
damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 4th.
