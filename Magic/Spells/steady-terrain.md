# Steady Terrain
*3rd-level transmutation (ritual)* (Druid, Ranger)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You transform the ground, allowing you and your allies to traverse it with ease. For the duration, you remove all difficult terrain along a 5-foot wide, 60-foot long line originating from a point you touch in a direction you choose. If the terrain is difficult due to a magical spell, this spell negates that condition of the other spell if it was cast at 3rd level or lower. 

When cast on a surface that would require a Strength (Athletics) skill check to traverse, any creatures you choose can make the skill checks with advantage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the length of the line increases by 30 feet for every slot level above 3rd.
