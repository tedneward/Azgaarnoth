#### Hovering Snare
*3rd-level conjuration* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You choose a 20-foot-by-20-foot sphere within range, creating an invisible web of energy in that area that immediately stops any creature flying or falling into its strands. A creature that flies into the web must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's speed drops to 0, and it is grappled by the web. However, it can use an action to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spellcasting DC to break free.

Although the web of energy reduces a creature's speed to 0, it isn't restrained, and it doesn't fall to the ground. It is simply held in place in mid-air, and it can act normally.
