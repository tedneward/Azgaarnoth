You evoke a chaotic storm of elemental energies, with randomly shifting dominance in different regions of the storm. Bolts of lightning, ﬂying rocks, frigid air, globules of acid, plumes of ﬂame, and thunderous booms rage throughout a 60-foot radius, 30-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. Roll a d6 for every creature within the cylinder when you cast this spell. Each affected creature is subjected to one of the following effects based on the roll:

1. **Bolts of lightning:** The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d10 lightning damage on a failed save, and half damage on a successful save.
2. **Flying rocks:** The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d12 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, and half damage on a successful save. A creature that fails its save is pushed 10 feet in a random direction (or the DM’s choice). Huge creatures are pushed 5 feet instead. Gargantuan creatures are not pushed.
3. **Frigid air:** The creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 12d6 cold damage on a failed save, and half damage on a successful save. A creature killed by this damage becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.
4. **Globules of acid:** The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 acid damage on a failed save, and half damage on a successful save. A creature that fails its save is coated with acid, and takes an additional 2d8 acid damage at the end of each of its turns until it succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check made as an action.
5. **Plumes of ﬂame:** The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d6 fire damage on a failed save, and half damage on a successful save.
6. **Thunderous booms:** The creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 thunder damage and becoming deafened on a failed save, and half damage on a successful save. A Huge or larger creature has advantage on the saving throw. A Gargantuan creature is not deafened.

If a creature enters or starts its turn within the storm, roll a d6 for the creature and apply one of the above effects.
