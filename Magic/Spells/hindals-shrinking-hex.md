---
You incant a wicked curse, ensorcelling one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. If it can't hear you, it succeeds automatically. On a failure, the target becomes cursed for the duration and instantly shrinks until it is size Tiny.

It remains that size until the spell ends or the curse is removed If it wasn't already size Tiny, it experiences the following effects while shrunken: 

* Whenever it takes damage, the damage is doubled.
* Its speed is reduced to one-fifth of its normal speed. 
* It cannot wield weapons except tiny weapons made to be wielded by Tiny creatures, and the damage it deals with weapon attacks is halved.
* Attacks made against it have disadvantage. 
* It automatically fails Strength saving throws and ability checks, and it has disadvantage on any ability checks made to grapple or to escape from a grapple. 
* It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) and Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks, as well on Dexterity checks to avoid being grappled.

This spell can be ended early by a [remove curse](./remove-curse.md), [greater restoration](./greater-restoration.md), or [wish](./wish.md) spell cast on the target. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the effect becomes permanent until the curse is dispelled.
