# Radiant Burst
*2nd-level evocation* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (15-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of phosphorous)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A burst of brilliant light erupts from you forcing all creatures within 15 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d10 radiant damage and is blinded until the end of their next turn. A successful saving throw halves the damage and the creature is not blinded.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radiant damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
