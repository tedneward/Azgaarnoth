Your voice booms like rolling thunder. For the duration, when you speak, you can choose to speak up to ten times as loudly as normaL and you can use an action on each of your turns to create a wave of sound that roars out from you and can be heard up to 3 miles away. You choose whether the wave is a 60-foot cone emanating from you or a spherical area that extends to 30 feet out from you in all directions.

Each creature other than you in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 4d12 thunder damage, it is pushed 30 feet away from you and knocked prone, and it is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half as much damage and nothing else.

When you create a wave of sound with this spell unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are pushed 30 feet away from you by the spell's effect. You can't create a wave of sound with this spell if you cannot speak.
