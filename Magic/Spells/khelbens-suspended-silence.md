*3rd-level illusion* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a feather and a handful of gem dust worth 50 gp, both of which are consumed in the casting)
- **Duration:** Special (see below)
---
You imbue the touched object with the magic of a [silence](./silence.md) spell, but that magic remains dormant until you use a bonus action to touch the object and speak a command word you designate. When you do so, for 1 minute, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the enchanted object.

As per the [silence](./silence.md) spell, any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible within the sphere.

The duration of this spell is permanent until the effect is activated. Once it is activated, the silence effect lasts for a duration of 1 minute, and then the spell ends. This spell ends early if you cast it again.
