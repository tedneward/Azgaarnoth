You conjure two watery globes of acid that appear in the air next to you. Both globes can target a single creature within range, or you can direct each to strike a different creature within range. For each globe you direct towards it, a target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d10 acid damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the acid damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
