---
You attempt to puppet the body of a creature that you can see within range by magically controlling its blood. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or else become afflicted by the spell for the duration and restrained until the start of its next turn. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the target is no longer afflicted by the spell.

At the start of each of the target's turns while it is afflicted by the spelL it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it is paralyzed until the start of its next turn. Alternatively, instead of making it paralyzed, you can choose to control its movement on its next turn and make it use its action on that turn to attack a target of your choice, with disadvantage on its attack rolls and moving at half of its speed. On a success, it is restrained until the start of its next turn and nothing else. 

Until the spell ends, you can use an action on your turn to try to afflict a creature that you can see within range. Any creatures that are still afflicted by the spell are no longer afflicted by it, and the new target must make the initial saving throw instead 

Creatures that have no blood, that can't be paralyzed, or that can't be restrained are immune to the spell If a creature afflicted by the spell is no longer within range of you, it immediately stops being afflicted by the spell.
