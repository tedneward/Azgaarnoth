You evoke a ï¬‚oating, spherical orb of solid magical force about six inches in diameter just above your hand. You need a free hand to maintain the orb; the orb is dismissed if you use the hand for any other purpose, but you can evoke the orb again as a bonus action. As an action, you can shoot the orb, making a ranged spell attack against a creature or object of your choice you can see within 120 feet. On a hit, the orb deals 4d8 bludgeoning damage and the target is pushed 10 feet (5 feet if it is Huge, 0 if it is Gargantuan). The orb immediately returns to you after the attack.The orb sheds bright light in a 10-ft. radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every slot level above 3rd.
