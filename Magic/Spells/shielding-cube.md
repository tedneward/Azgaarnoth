You direct a minute cube of force into the thick of
battle, where it suddenly expands, slamming your
enemy and protecting your allies. Make a ranged
spell attack against one creature within range. If the
attack hits, the target takes 2d6 force damage and
its speed is reduced by half until the end of its next
turn. Until its speed is longer reduced in this way,
whenever the target takes makes an attack against a
creature more than 5 feet away from it, it must roll a
d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack
roll.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
