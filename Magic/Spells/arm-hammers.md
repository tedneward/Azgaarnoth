Both of your hands transform into adamantine hammers. These hammers are considered light for two weapon fighting and magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks. These hammers deal magical bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. These hammers do double damage to objects and structures. You can use a bonus action to dismiss the spell at any time during the spell's duration. You cannot cast any spells requiring somatic components while this spell is active.
