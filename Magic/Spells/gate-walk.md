You conjure spinning rings of magical light around the ankles and wrists of one creature you can see within range that last for the duration. Using these bands, the target can conjure small and fleeting spatial gateways to aid in combat. Until the spell ends, the target gains the following benefits: 

* As a bonus action on its turn and as a reaction when the spell is cast, the target can teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space that it can see. 

* Whenever the target makes an attack on its turn, it can open a small arcane gateway for the attack to pass through. If it is a melee attack, the target can increase the reach of that attack up to 60 feet. If it is a ranged attack, it ignores half cover, three-quarters cover, and long distance penalties. 

* Whenever the target hits a creature with a weapon attack, the weapon is treated as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances with that attack, and the attack deals 2d8 bonus force damage. This bonus damage can only be dealt once per turn. 

* When the target is hit by an attack, it can use its reaction to open a small arcane gateway to disrupt the attack. The attacker must reroll the attack roll and use the new result.
