---
A purple-hued radiance surrounds your hand until
you successfully hit a creature with a melee spell
attack. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 poison
damage, and it must make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the
end of its next turn.
Once you hit a creature and deal damage, the
spell ends if the target succeeded on its saving
throw; otherwise, the spell ends after the target's
next turn on a failed save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd or higher level, the poison damage
increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
