---
You replicate the ﬂames of an infamous archdevil, known for their ability to deliver the intense pain of burning even to elemental creatures native to the Plane of Fire. You project a 60-foot cone of hellish ﬂames in a direction of your choice. Every creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw and a Wisdom saving throw. A creature takes 7d6 fire damage on a failed Dexterity save, and takes half damage on a successful save. A creature takes 7d6 psychic damage on a failed Wisdom save, and takes half damage on a successful save.

The fire ignites ﬂammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you increase the fire damage and the psychic damage each by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
