A shimmering magical force appears and shelters you from danger at the cost of your stability. When you are targeted with an attack but before you know if the attack hits, you can roll a d6. If the attack hits, the die roll is subtracted from the damage done by a single attack and you fall prone. If the attack misses, you fall prone and are incapacitated until the end of your next turn. The spell then ends.

This amount increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
