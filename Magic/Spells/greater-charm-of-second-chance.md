# Greater Charm of Second Chance
*4th-level divination* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you make a saving throw, ability check, or attack roll

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a weighted die)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Twisting the Weave of magic in your favor, you influence the world with uncanny luck. After rolling a die, you can use your reaction to reroll it and add or subtract an amount equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, but you must accept the new result.
