*9th-level evocation* (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (1-mile radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a twig taken from a tree in Winter)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
---
A 6-inch thick layer of ice and snow covers the ground and grounded objects within 1 mile of you, turning all ground in the affected area into difficult terrain. All nonmagical fire in the affected area is extinguished as well as currently burning ï¬‚ames created by spells of 6th level or lower.

Unattended bodies of liquid within the affected area will freeze solid or form surface layers of ice.

The atmosphere within 1 mile of you is chilled and slightly fogged for the duration, causing fire damage dealt within 1 mile of you to be halved for the duration, and the area to be lightly obscured for seeing creatures and objects more than 60 feet away.

If a creature attempts to move more than 10 feet on the ground during the duration, it must make a DC 10 Acrobatics (Dexterity) check to balance or fall prone; special exceptions such as adaptive footwear or natural adaptations may make balancing checks unnecessary.
