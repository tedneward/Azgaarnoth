#### Symphonic Nightmare
*7th-level enchantment* (Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (an exceptionally crafted small statue of an opened skull with a miniature orchestra within the cavity, which is worth at least 1,000 gp)
- **Duration:** 1 week
---
A creature you touch loses its ability to sleep
restfully for the duration of the spell. Instead of
peaceful fantasies, the subject's dreams are filled
with a discordant orchestra. Starting when the
subject next finishes a long rest, it has disadvantage
on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws for
the duration of the spell.
In addition, until the spell ends, whenever the
subject finishes a long rest, it must roll a Wisdom
saving throw. If it fails, it does not gain the benefits
of that long rest.
The subject is immune to the dream spell while
under the influence of this spell. This spell can be
ended by a remove curse  or greater restoration  spell
cast using a 7th-level or higher spell slot, in addition
to being dispelled normally.
