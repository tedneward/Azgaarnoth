# Reverse Projectiles
*5th-level abjuration* (Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Ranger, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, taken when you or a creature within 30 feet of you is hit with a ranged weapon attack

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a metal bracelet)

**Duration:** 1 round

Your magic causes the attack to be reversed upon the attacker. The attack does not hit the original target, and instead the attacker makes a new attack roll against itself.

Until the start of your next turn, whenever you or a creature within 30 feet of you is targeted with a ranged weapon attack, you can choose to reverse the attack, forcing the attacker to make the attack roll against itself instead.

Reversed attacks by this spell have advantage and ignore obscurement and invisibility. Determine range and cover for these reversed attacks as if they were made from the attacked creature back to the attacker.

If the attacker has proficiency in Arcana, has truesight, or is affected by detect magic or a similar magical effect, it can perceive this spell soon enough to avoid attacking an affected creature. Otherwise, an attacker only learns of the spell after having at least one of its attacks reversed.
