#### Ice Shield
*2nd-level conjuration* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You conjure a barrier of ice to block incoming attacks. You gain a +5 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack still hits, the ice is shattered but absorbs some of the impact, reducing the damage you take from the attack by 10.

If the triggering attack misses, then the ice shield fuses to the ground to create a 4 foot by 4 foot barrier that's 4 inches thick and can provide cover. (If you are flying or otherwise not on a solid surface, then the ice simply falls.) This ice wall has AC 10 and 20 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire damage. The ice is nonmagical after being conjured, and will thus melt naturally.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, for each slot level above 2nd, the damage it can absorb from the triggering attack increases by 5 and the hit points of a lingering shield increase by 10.
