---
Your mouth opens impossibly wide and you appear to devour an enemy creature, banishing it to a claustrophobic demiplane that resembles the belly of some horrid beast. Choose a Medium or smaller creature within range and make a melee spell attack against it. If you succeed, the target vanishes to the demiplane, where it remains for the duration or until it fights its way free.

At the start of each of its turns, the confined target must make a Constitution saving throw. It
takes 3d6 acid damage and 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.

The target can use its action to attack the fleshy walls confining it. The Armor Class of the walls equals 15 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. The walls automatically succeed on all Strength and Constitution saving throws or checks, but automatically fail all other saving throws or checks.

The walls are immune to all conditions. They have resistance to acid damage and vulnerability to poison damage. If the walls take a total of 60 or more damage, the target escapes, and the spell ends. When the spell ends, a rift slashes open in the nearest unoccupied space to you, and the creature emerges from it into that space.
