# Blasphemous
*9th-level evocation* (Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (60-foot-radius sphere)

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You utter a phrase so baneful that it pains those who hear it, possibly even killing them. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Consitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 psychic damage when the spell is cast, and then again at the start of each of its turn for the duration. Additionally, it suffers an effect based on its current hit points:

* 90 hit points or less: incapacitated for the duration
* 70 hit points or less: stunned for the duration
* 50 hit points or less: paralyzed for the duration
* 30 hit points or less: killed instantly

At any point during the spell's duration, if an affected creature's current hit points are reduced to a point that would cause it to suffer a different effect, the creature must make a Consitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature suffers the new effect. On a success, the spell ends for that creature.

Any creature who is killed by this spell can be restored to life only by means of a [true resurrection](/Magic/Spells/true-resurrection.md) or a [wish](/Magic/Spells/wish.md) spell.
