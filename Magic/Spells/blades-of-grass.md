- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Up to 15 pieces of grass or conifer leaves that you touch transform into magical weaponry. You transform each object into your choice of an arrow, blowgun needle, or crossbow bolt. If you target no more than two objects, your choices for transformation also include a dagger, shortsword, scimitar, rapier, longsword, or greatsword. 

These weapons and ammunition are magical. They are constructed out of plant material and weigh half as much as usuaL and they are extra sharp, granting them a +1 bonus to damage rolls.

Ammunition created by this spell is destroyed when it hits a target. When the spell ends, all the weaponry turns to dust.
