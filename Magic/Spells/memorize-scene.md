___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You spend a few moments looking around at your
surroundings while enhancing your senses to attain
absolute focus on every detail. Until the spell ends,
whenever you make an Intelligence or Wisdom
check that includes your proficiency bonus, you can
roll a d4 and add the number rolled to your result.
In addition, until the spell ends, you have perfect
recall of everything you could see, hear, smell, taste,
and touch at the moment you cast it. This includes
everything that your senses could perceive in every
direction, as well as every word you had heard
spoken for 1 minute prior to the casting.
You have it all perfectly memorized, allowing you
to make Intelligence and Wisdom checks to discern
information about the area as if you were there until
the spell ends, even if you are far away. Words on
the open page of a book, creatures that flew by
quickly, and even unfolding magical effects can all
be examined in memory as if they were in front of
you and holding still. When you examine the area in
this way, you can only perceive the area as it was
when you cast this spell, and this spell grants no
awareness of any ways in which the area might have
changed since then.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th or 5th level, you can concentrate
on the spell for up to 8 hours. With a slot that's 6th
level or higher, you can concentrate for up to 24
hours.
