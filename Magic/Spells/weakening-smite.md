#### Weakening Smite
*1st-level necromancy* (Paladin)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action 
- **Range:** Self 
- **Components:** V 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 
---
The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration, your weapon glows with green energy, and the attack deals an extra 1d8 poison damage to the target. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Constitution saving throw or else be poisoned until the spell ends. The poison effect also counts as a disease. 

As an action, the target can make a Constitution check with advantage against your spell save DC to retch magical sludge out of its body and end this spell on a success. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the poison damage dealt increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
