#### Chilling Frost
*5th-level evocation* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You choose to envelop a target within range with a
swirling frost. The target takes 7d6 cold damage,
and is covered by a chilling frost for the duration.
The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On
a success, it only takes half the cold damage, and
the spell ends.
However, if the target fails the saving throw, it
must continue to make Dexterity saving throws at
the beginning of each of its turns or take 3d6 cold
damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. A
target reduced to 0 hit points by this spell becomes
a frozen statue.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the amount of
initial and ongoing cold damage increases by 1d6 for
each slot level above 5th.
