You point at one creature that you can see within range that is wearing armor. The target's armor becomes frosted and icy until the spell ends, protecting the target and granting it the following benefits while worn: 

* The target has resistance to cold damage. 
* The target has a +2 bonus to AC. 
* When the target is hit with a melee attack by an attacker within 5 feet of it, if the attacker doesn't have resistance or immunity to cold damage, its speed is reduced by 15 feet and it has disadvantage on weapon attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
