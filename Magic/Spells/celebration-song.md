You perform a magical drinking song that causes listeners to become highly intoxicated. Choose up to six creatures that can hear you within range. For the duration of the spell, on each of your turns you can use a bonus action to make a DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check. If you succeed, each of the creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature that fails this saving throw is charmed by you and poisoned until the end of your next turn, as if it were heavily intoxicated due to drinking. Creatures that have succeeded on a saving throw against this spell within the past minute have advantage on subsequent saving throws against it.
