- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You evoke a thunderous noise, loud enough for creatures to hear from miles away. Every creature in a 20-foot sphere centered on a point you can see must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is deafened until it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw made whenever it ends a turn. On a successful save, a creature is deafened until the end of its next turn. If a creature that failed the saving throw was within 10 feet of the sphereâ€™s origin, then it also takes 2d6 thunder damage.

Every creature within an additional 20 feet must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is deafened until the end of its next turn.
