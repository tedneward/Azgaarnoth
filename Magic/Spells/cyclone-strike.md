Slicing wind swirls around you in a cyclone as you make a magical spinning strike. You make a melee attack with a weapon that you are holding against each creature of your choice within the spell's range. If you are holding two weapons that you can use for two-weapon fighting, you can make an attack with each of those weapons against each target, using two-weapon fighting rules to determine each attack's damage. 

For these attacks, the weapons count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and their reach is the spell's range. After the attacks, the wind disperses gas or vapor and extinguishes unprotected flames that are torch-sized or smaller within 20 feet of you. 

Until the start of your next turn, any ranged weapon attacks made against you have disadvantage.
