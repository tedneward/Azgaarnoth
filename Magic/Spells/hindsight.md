Ghostly images recreate the events of the past, centered on the spot where you cast the spell. The amount of detail in the images depends on how much time you wish to see and hear. When you cast the spell, you must choose one unit of time to view.

* Days. You view the events of the last 20 days. You get detailed knowledge of the conversations, people, and events.
* Weeks. You see a summary of the events of the past 20 weeks. You will not hear and see everything that happens, but you will understand the gist of conversations and events. You will see important people and events in greater detail.
* Years. You see the noteworthy events of the past 20 years. Major participants and events, like executions, battles, and discoveries, will play out in greater detail.
* Centuries.  You gain a general sense of the last 500 years. You will only see the most important events and most remarkable people.
