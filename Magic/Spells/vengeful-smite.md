You are blessed with the bravery to take harm for your beliefs, granting you 2d8 temporary hit points. The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, your attack deals 3d8 bonus force damage. 

In addition, if you took damage while concentrating on this spell or during the turn that you cast the spell, your attack also creates a wave of vengeful blood that crashes through a 30-foot cone originating from you, which must include the target. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. 

On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 2d8 force damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.
