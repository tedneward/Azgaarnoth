#### Electric Fence
*3rd-level abjuration* (Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create an invisible, spherical perimeter around
a point you can see within range. The area has a 
radius of 15 feet. Whenever a creature would enter 
or leave this area without teleporting, the spell 
delivers an electric shock.

An affected creature must make a Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8
lightning damage and until the beginning of its next 
turn its speed is reduced to 0 and it can't gain any 
bonuses to its speed. This occurs before the creature 
crosses the threshold. On a successful save, the 
creature takes half as much damage and its 
movement is not impeded.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
