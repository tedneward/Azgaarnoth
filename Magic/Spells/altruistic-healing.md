---
If you have at least 2 hit points when you cast this
spell, you can transfer any number of your own hit
points to a willing creature you touch. Each hit
point you transfer deals one damage to you and
heals your target for one hit point. You cannot give
the target more hit points than their normal
maximum, nor can you transfer any number of hit
points from yourself that would reduce you to less
than 1 hit point. You can heal the transferred hit
points as if you had taken damage. This spell has no
effect on constructs or undead.
