#### Cometfall
*6th-level conjuration* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
When you cast this spell, a blazing comet plummets
to the ground at a point you choose within range.
Once the comet touches the ground it explodes
with a thunderous roar. Each creature within 20 feet
of the exploding comet must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
5d6 bludgeoning and 5d6 thunder damage, and is
pushed 10 feet back and knocked prone. On a
successful save, the creature takes half the damage
and isn't pushed or knocked prone.
In addition, the comet's impact area is filled with
rubble and is considered difficult terrain. The sound
of the impact can be heard up to 1 mile away (or
farther with a successful Wisdom (Perception)
check as determined by your DM).
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the bludgeoning
and thunder damage both increase by 1d6 for each
slot level above 6th.
