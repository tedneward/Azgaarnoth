#### Lava Missile
*2nd-level conjuration* (Cleric,Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 Feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (any object made of glass)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You conjure handfuls of liquid-hot stone from the elemental planes and hurl them at foes with unerring accuracy. You create four lava missiles, each of which hits a target of your choice that you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack. If you hit a lava missile deals 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 bludgeoning damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several. The darts can also target objects that are not being worn or carried, and ignites them if they are flammable.

If a lava missile strikes a [firenewt](../../Creatures/Firenewts.md) or an earth-based or fire-based elemental creature (such as a gargoyle or salamander), it does not inflict damage on the creature. Instead, that creature is healed, regaining 1d4 hit points for each lava missile that hits. Only firenewts or creatures of the elemental type can benefit from this effect. 

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 2nd.
