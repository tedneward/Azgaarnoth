You attempt to instantly freeze a target solid. Choose one Medium or smaller creature you can see within range. If that creature fails a Constitution saving throw, it freezes in place and is paralyzed for the duration.

A creature that is immune to cold damage is unaffected by this spell and a creature that is resistant to cold damage has advantage on the saving throw.As long as a creature is paralyzed by this spell, it has vulnerability to fire damage. However, if the creature takes at least 10 points of fire damage at once, that creature is no longer affected by this spell.

An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd. For every two creatures you could target, you can instead choose to target a single Large creature.
