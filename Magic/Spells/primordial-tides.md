#### Primordial Tides
*7th-level evocation* (Druid,Sorcerer)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 3 rounds
---
You release a blast of chaotic magic that washes out from you in a 60-foot cone. Until the spell ends, ground in the area is difficult terrain, and at the end of each of your turns a wave of elemental energy pulses through the area, targeting each creature in the area with a magical effect. The effect is different each round:

* **Round 1.** Targets must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 7 d6 cold damage and its speed is reduced by 20 feet until the next pulse. On a success, a target takes half damage and its speed is not reduced.
* **Round 2.** Targets must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 4d6 lightning damage and 3d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half damage and isn't knocked prone.
* **Round 3.** Targets must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 7 d6 fire damage and is lit [ablaze](../../Conditions/Ablaze.md). On a success, a target takes half damage and is not lit ablaze.

***At Higher Levels.***When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the fire, cold, and lightning damage dealt all increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
