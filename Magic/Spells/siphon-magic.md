___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You drain magical energy from a creature that you touch, adding it to your own reserves. Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can see. On a hit, the creature loses one unspent spell slot of the highest level it currently holds and you regain one spent spell slot of the same level. If the drained spell slot is at a higher level than your highest spent spell slot, then you instead regain your highest level spent spell slot. If the creature has no spell slots to drain, then nothing happens and the spell is wasted.
