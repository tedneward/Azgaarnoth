---
You are surrounded by
a swirling mass of
blood red droplets.
These drops move to
intercept any attack
by magically joining
together and hardening into a barrier. For the
duration, you gain a +4 bonus to AC and gain
advantage on any saving throw versus fire or cold
damage. However, you have disadvantage on any
saving throw versus lightning damage.
You can use an action to throw the droplets up to
10 feet from you and reform them into a stationary
bulwark made of an iron-like red metal. The
bulwark is 10 feet tall, 10 feet wide, and 1-inch thick.
The bulwark has AC 15 and 30 hit points. The
bulwark has resistance to cold damage and
vulnerability to lightning damage. Once you have
thrown the droplets, they will remain in the form of
the solid bulwark until the spell ends, but you no
longer gain the bonus to AC.
