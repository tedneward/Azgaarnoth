#### Charge
*3rd-level evocation* (Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You build a charge while running and then release 
it in a devastating electric punch. After casting this 
spell, before the end of your next turn you can spend
a bonus action to deliver the punch, which ends the 
spell. The target must make a Dexterity saving 
throw, taking 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save 
or half as much damage on a successful save.

The spell becomes more powerful if you move in a
straight line toward your target immediately before 
delivering the punch. For every 5 feet moved this 
way, replace one of the damage dice with a d12. 
Make this substitution before rolling. If at least four 
dice are replaced this way, then a target that fails its
save is also pushed 10 feet away from you and 
knocked prone.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
