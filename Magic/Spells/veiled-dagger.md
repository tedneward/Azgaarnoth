---
You weave magic into the shape of an invisible knife and throw it at one target you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target, with advantage on the attack roll if the creature does not have blindsight or truesight and cannot see invisible objects. On a hit, the target takes 10d4 piercing damage. On a miss, it takes half as much damage, but the type is slashing damage. 

The attack also counts as a ranged weapon attack made using a finesse weapon, and you can choose to use your Dexterity modifier instead of your spell casting modifier for the attack roll. If you are hidden from any creatures when you cast this spelL neither the spell nor the attack reveal your position.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 3rd.
