This spell strikes creatures with wracking pains and
agony, even if they are unliving. Roll 12d8, and total
the dice. The number rolled is the number of hit
points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures
within 20 feet of a point you choose within range
are affected in ascending order of their current hit
points (ignoring unconscious creatures and
constructs, who are not affected by this spell).
Subtract each creature's hit points from the total
before moving on to the creature with the next
lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be
equal to or less than the remaining total for that
creature to be affected.
Starting with the creature that has the lowest
current hit points, each creature affected by this
spell has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability
checks until the spell ends. Each creature can
attempt to resist, but only at the risk of making its
agony even worse. Each creature affected by the
spell can choose whether to make a Constitution
saving throw to try to resist the spell's effect at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
with a success. However, if the creature fails the
saving throw, it takes 3d6 psychic damage. A
creature that fails this saving throw four times in a
row is incapacitated with pain, in addition to the
spell's other effects.
