___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee weapon attack against one
creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell
fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal
effects, and you mark the creature until the end of
your next turn, bellowing a magical challenge it
cannot ignore. This spell ends early if you are
incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks
the creature.
The next time a creature marked by you with this
spell makes an attack roll that doesn't target you
while it is within 5 feet of you, it has disadvantage
on the attack.
If a creature marked by you with this spell
willingly moves more than 30 feet away from you, or
if makes an attack that suffers disadvantage from
this spell, it immediately takes 1d8 psychic damage,
and the spell ends.
At Higher Levels.  At 5th level, the melee attack
deals an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target, and
you add an additional 1d8 to the damage a
creature you marked with this spell suffers
for moving more than 30 feet away from you
or attacking you with the disadvantage imposed
by this spell. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at
11th level and 17th level.
