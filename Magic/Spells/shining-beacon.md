You channel divine energy to reproduce the light of the higher realms. A hovering orb of light appears just above you, shedding bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. The orb moves with you and suppresses magical darkness in its light. Every undead within the light’s radius when the spell is cast must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the undead takes 2d6 radiant damage and is frightened of the orb. Whenever an undead starts its turn within the light’s radius, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 radiant damage and becoming frightened of the orb on a failed save.

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with darkness created by a spell of 4th level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.
