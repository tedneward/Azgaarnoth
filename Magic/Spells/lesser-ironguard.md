The person touched is immune to nonmagical metal for the duration of the spell. Metal items pass through you, and cause no harm. You can also walk through metal barriers, such as gates or bars. Magical metal objects affect you normally, as do spells. Secondary effects delivered by metal items affect you normally, such as a poisoned weapon attack.

If the spell expires while metal is inside you, the object is shunted out of your body or you are pushed away from it to the nearest unoccupied space; as a result, you and the object both take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

Since you pass through metal objects, your unarmed attacks ignore metal armor while you are under the effects of this spell. This does not change the Armor Class of a creature wearing metal armor, but it grants you advantage on unarmed attack rolls against such creatures.
