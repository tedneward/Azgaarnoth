A bright streak ï¬‚ashes from your pointed finger to a point you chose within range, and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of freezing air. Every creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 cold damage, or half damage on a success.

The air spreads around corners. It extinguishes nonmagical fires that it engulfs and freezes unattended liquids. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
