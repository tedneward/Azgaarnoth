A powerful and complex gesture of your hands
weaves a bilious yellow ray that lashes out to strike
your enemy. Make a ranged spell attack. If you hit,
your target must make a Constitution save. If they
fail, they are paralyzed for the duration of the spell.
If they pass they are poisoned for the duration of
the spell instead. A paralyzed victim may make a
Constitution save at the end of their turn to end the
paralyzed condition and become poisoned. A
poisoned victim may make a Constitution save at
the end of their turn to end the spell.
