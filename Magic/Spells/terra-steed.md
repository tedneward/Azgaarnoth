You conjure an earthen boulder, which you leap atop as part of casting the spell and your magic causes it to float and fly. You gain a flying speed of 30 feet for the duration. While you fly in this way, the boulder remains beneath you and can provide half cover. If you fall while flying in this way, the spell ends immediately. 

In addition, if you fly at least 20 feet straight toward a target using this flying speed on your turn, you can use your bonus action to slam the target using the boulder. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 nonmagical bludgeoning damage for each 30 feet of flying speed the boulder has.

When the spell ends, the boulder turns to dust and you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the flying speed you gain increases by 30 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
