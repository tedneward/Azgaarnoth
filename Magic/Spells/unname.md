You point at one target and speak one ancient,
terrible word that will blast your foe's soul into
oblivion and reduce its body to ashes. Choose one
creature within range, which must make a Wisdom
saving throw or immediately die. A target with
more than 150 hit points automatically succeeds on
this saving throw. A creature slain by this effect
cannnot be brought back to life by any means,
including wish or true resurrection .
Speaking this word takes a toll on the spellcaster
as well. You must make a Constitution saving
throw, using the same DC as the target. If you fail,
you are slain outright, and cannnot be brought back
to life by any means, including wish or true
resurrection . On a success, you immediately die, but
you can be brought back to life normally by spells
like raise dead or true resurrection .
