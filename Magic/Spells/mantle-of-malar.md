# Mantle of Malar
*6th-level transmutation* (Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Sorcerer)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a tuft of werewolf fur)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You adopt a spectral visage of a ravenous wolf spirit. For the duration, creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you gain advantage on attack rolls against their target if at least one of their allies is within 5 feet of that target and the ally isn't incapacitated.

Additionally, actions you take on your turn gain special aspects as you channel Malar's bestial will. If you take the Attack action, creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you when you make the attack must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of their next turn; if you take the Dash action your jump distance is tripled; if you take the Disengage action, your movement speed increases by 10 feet; if you take the Dodge action, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons that aren't silvered.
