By temporarily expanding and stabilizing the foundation of your magic, your deepest, most basic channels of magical energy, you empower your lowest level yet most practiced spells. For the duration, all of your cantrips have their ranges, their area parameters, and their damage dice doubled. When the spell ends, you gain one level of exhaustion.
