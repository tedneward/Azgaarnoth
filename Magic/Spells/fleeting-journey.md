# Fleeting Journey
*5th-level conjuration* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a miniature metal spring)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature and teleport it to a safe and unoccupied space that you can see within 100 feet. The target creature maintains an astral tether to its original location. When the spell ends, the target creature returns to its original location, or the nearest safe, unoccupied space if the original space is occupied.

You must succeed on a melee spell attack to affect an unwilling target. The target creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or else be teleported. The target creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect of the spell on a success. The target creature is then immediately returned to its original location, or the nearest safe, unoccupied space if the original space is occupied.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, one additional creature you touch can be teleported in this way for each slot level above 5th.
