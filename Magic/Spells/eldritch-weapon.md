A moment of battlefield success grants you a
magical epiphany, allowing you to place a combat
enchantment on your weapon. As part of the action
used to cast this spell, you must make a melee
attack with a weapon against one creature within
the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit,
the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and
you draw chronomantic magic energy from the
target's place in time to enchant your weapon. For
the duration, the speed of the target you hit is
reduced by half, you have advantage on melee spell
attacks against the target, and you can use the
melee weapon you attacked with as a spellcasting
focus for any spell you cast. Whether you hit or
miss, until the spell ends, the weapon gains a +1
bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is a
magic weapon that already has a bonus to those
rolls.
At Higher Levels.  When you use a spell slot of
5th or 6th level to cast this spell, the weapon's
magical bonus increases to +2. When you cast it
with a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the bonus is
+3.
