The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, the weapon glows with an intense illumination and ﬂashes a burst of light on impact. The attack deals an extra 4d6 radiant damage, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is blinded until the start of your next turn. Every creature within 10 feet of the target (excluding yourself) must also make a Constitution saving throw, becoming blinded until the start of your next turn on a failed save.
