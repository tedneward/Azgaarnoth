- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
This spell creates an arcane ward that surrounds
and protects you, harmlessly absorbing the energy
of spells that target you to fuel your own casting.
For the duration, you can use the ward as a reaction
to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and
which does not have an area of effect. The absorbed
Once the ward absorbs a spell, you can use the
captured spell energy, which has the same level as
the spell when it was cast. The ward can absorb a
number of spell levels equal to half your level + your
spellcasting ability modifier. Once the ward absorbs
that number of levels of spell energy, it can't absorb
more. If you are targeted by a spell that the ward
can't store, the ward has no effect on that spell. You
always know how much spell energy your ward has
absorbed and how many spell levels are currently
stored within it.
You can convert levels of spell energy stored in
your ward to cast spells you have prepared or know,
creating new spell slots from the stored energy
rather than using slots of your own. You can create
spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your
own highest-level spell slots, up to a maximum of
5th level. You use the stored levels of spell energy in
place of your own spell slots, but otherwise cast the
spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels of
spells stored in the ward as a 3rd-level spell slot.
Any spell levels remaining in the ward when the
spell ends are lost.
