# Soulshare
*1st-level transmutation* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction (see description)

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (Soul Object or Soul Object duplicate)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

If you are a [Soulbinder](/Classes/Wizard/Soulbinding.md), as a reaction when the possessor of your [soul object duplicate](/Magic/Spells/duplicate-soul-object.md) meets appropriate conditions, you cast this spell and are able to apply your archetype abilities to a creature that has your Soul Object duplicate in their possession. You can only apply archetype abilities that you currently have access to, and you must abide by all the other requirements (except the target changes from you to the target creature of this spell).

If you are not a [Soulbinder](/Classes/Wizard/Soulbinding.md), this spell has no effect and serves no purpose.
