---
You conjure a dagger made of emerald poison in your free hand that lasts for the duration. If you let go of the dagger, it disappears, but you can conjure it again as a bonus action. When it is thrown, it only disappears after it hits or misses a target, and it returns to your hand the next time you conjure it. 

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack using the dagger, or you can throw it to make a ranged spell attack against a target within 30 feet. On a hit, the target takes 7d8 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the spell ends. It must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it is no longer poisoned by the spell.

The spell attack also counts as a weapon attack made using a finesse weapon, and you can choose to use your Dexterity modifier instead of your spellcasting modifier for the attack roll.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every slot level above 7th.
