#### Vecna's Final Command

___

You temporarily infuse a dying creature with
necrotic power, allowing it to make one final strike.
Before becoming incapacitated, the creature can
immediately use its reaction to make one weapon
attack. If the attack hits, it inflicts extra necrotic
damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the necrotic
damage inflicted increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 2nd.
