# Predict Action
*7th-level divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 6 miles

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You target a creature you can see (but is not necessarily in your line of sight) within range and make one of the following predictions about what they will do on their next turn:
* **Attack**: You predict with what weapon or whom they will attack.
* **Use Tactics**: You predict if they will use the Hide, Dash, Dodge, or Disengage action.
* **Cast a Spell**: You predict if they will cast a spell. If the target does what you predicted on their next turn, they must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 12d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The DM determines how well the creatureâ€™s actions match the criteria the caster set forth.
