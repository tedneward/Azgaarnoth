You fix your magically empowered gaze upon one creature you can see within range, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell has no effect. On a failure, it gains resistance to all nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage until the spell ends. However, for the same duration, its movement rate is reduced by half, it has disadvantage on all Dexterity saves for the duration, and it can't use reactions or bonus actions until the spell ends. During the target's turn it can only take one action, and it cannot move unless that action is one that includes movement (such as the Dash action). Also, the target cannot cast spells for the duration. A creature affected by this spell can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.
