The next time you are surprised before the spell ends, your magical preparation allows you to take one quick action in response. Though you are still surprised, rather than being completely unable to act, you can take one action on your turn during the surprise round. This action can be used only to take one of the following actions: Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Hide, or Use an Object. After you take this action, the spell ends early.
