Your body transforms entirely into colorful magical light for the duration, granting you the following benefits: 

* You are immune to radiant damage and you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. 
* You ignore the effects of disease, exhaustion, and poisons. Any poisons or diseases already in your system are suspended, not neutralized. 
* You cannot be grappled or restrained. 
* You can move into and end your turn in the spaces of any objects that light can pass through (such as glass or crystal), but they are difficult terrain for you. 
* At the start of each of your turns, you choose to glow or stop glowing. While glowing, you shed bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet, magical darkness is suppressed within 30 feet of you, and creatures within 30 feet of you can't benÂ­efit from invisibility. You choose the light's color. 
* When a spell you cast deals radiant damage, it ignores resistance to radiant damage, and it deals extra radiant damage equal to 10 + twice the spell's level. A spell can't deal this extra damage to any creature more than once per turn.
