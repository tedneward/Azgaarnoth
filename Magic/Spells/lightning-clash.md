___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Your attack leaves a glowing mote of arcane power
in your enemy's wound. As part of the action used
to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack
with a weapon against one creature within the
spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the
target suffers the attack's normal effects and it takes
additional 2d6 thunder damage as electricity
arcs from the target to a different creature of
your choice that you can see within 5 feet of
it. The second creature takes lightning
damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting
ability modifier.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you
cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, the lightning
damage increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 1st.
