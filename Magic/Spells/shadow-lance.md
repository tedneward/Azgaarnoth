- **Duration:** 1 round 
---
You weave shadow into a solid spike and hurl it at a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or else take 1d8 piercing damage. If both you and the target are in dim light or darkness, the target instead takes 1d10 piercing damage, and you are heavily obscured to it until the start of your next turn. The effect ends immediately if you or the target enter bright light. 

The spell's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d10), 11th level (3d8 or 3d10) and 17th level (4d8 or 4d10).
