You place an electric charge within a creature you can see within range. The target takes 2d8 lightning damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the beginning of its next turn and be affected this way by the spell for the entire duration.

An affected creature repeats this process at the start of each of its turns. When the creature accumulates three successful saving throws against the spell, the creature is no longer affected.
