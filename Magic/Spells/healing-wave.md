Healing magic washes out from you and over nearby allies in a rolling wave that amplifies vital energy. You and up to five other creatures of your choice within range regain a number of hit points equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

If you are still conscious at the start of your next turn, you and up to five other creatures of your choice within range regain hit points again in the same way (you roll again).

This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or creatures that have 0 hit points.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing done at the start of your next turn increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
