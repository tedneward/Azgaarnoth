You create a cloud of silver-white fog that fills a 40-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. The area of the fog is heavily obscured.

When the fog appears, each creature in the fog must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn within the fog. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 5d8 psychic damage, and until the end of its next turn, it can't take reactions and its speed is halved. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't slowed or prevented from taking reactions. 

The spell deals no damage to unconscious creatures or to creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower. 

Saving throws to maintain concentration caused by this spell have disadvantage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by the spell's damage is stable instead of dying, but it permanently loses its memory of what happened between when the spell was cast and the current time. 

If you're within range of the sphere, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet as a bonus action on your turn.
