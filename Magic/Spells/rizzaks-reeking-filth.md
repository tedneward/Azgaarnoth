---
You spray foul-smelling filth in a swirl around you. Each creature other than you that is within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it is spattered by noxious filth and takes 3d6 poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful saving throw. 

Until the spell ends, you give off a potent stench. Each creature that starts its turn within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature automatically succeeds on any further saving throws against this casting of the spell Creatures of your choice are immune to this stench. 

If you are targeted by an effect that ends the poisoned condition, you must succeed on a DC 15 spellcasting ability check or else the spell ends immediately. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the range increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
