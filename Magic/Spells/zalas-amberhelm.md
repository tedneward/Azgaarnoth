Created by a mage that was paranoid that someone
was always trying to control her mind, this spell
forms a bubble of amber energy that covers your
head. For the duration, you are immune to all
enchantment spells and any ability that mimics an
enchantment spell. However, you have
disadvantage on any saving throw versus any spell
from the Evocation school.
