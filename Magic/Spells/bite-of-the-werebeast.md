You change yourself into a bestial shape which resembles the hybrid form of a lycanthrope of your choice. You retain this form until the spell ends, gaining the following traits:

* You have resistance to all nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from weapons that aren't silvered.
* You have advantage on all Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and Wisdom (Perception) checks.
* Your carrying capacity is doubled.
* You grow fangs, which act as a natural weapon with which you are proficient. You can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using your fangs, which inflict 2d8 piercing damage. Your fangs are considered magical, granting you a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using them.
* Your Armor Class cannot be lower than 15, no matter what kind of armor you are wearing.
* Whenever you take the attack action on your turn, you can attack with your fangs as a bonus action.

While in this form, at the start of each of your turns, you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. If you fail, you cannot cast spells until the beginning of your next turn.
