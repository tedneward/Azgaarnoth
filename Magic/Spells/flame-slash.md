#### Flame Slash
*1st-level evocation* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 15 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You swing your arm in a wide arc, and a stream of
fire follows along at a distance. Choose a point 
within range. Fire fills a line 5 feet wide and 20 feet 
long from that point, but every part of the line is an 
equal distance from you, thus forming an arc.

Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity 
saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a 
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful 
one.

The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that 
aren't being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage 
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
