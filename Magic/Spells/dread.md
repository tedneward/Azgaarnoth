You speak an augury against a creature that you can see within range, filling them with a sense of trepidation. On a failed Wisdom saving throw, the target suffers disadvantage on all attacks against you. Also, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom skill checks made for the duration.

A [remove curse](./remove-curse.md) spell cast on the target ends this effect.
