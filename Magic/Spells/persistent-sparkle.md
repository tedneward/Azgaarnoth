#### Persistent Sparkle
*1st-level evocation* *(ritual)* (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours
---
A creature or object you can see within range, no larger than a 10-foot wide cube, has sparkling motes of magical light seemingly attached to it. The motes of light produce bright light out to a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If a creature is unwilling, it must make a Wisdom saving throw; on a successful save, the motes of light appear only for a brief moment before the spell ends.

If cast as a ritual on an object, you can make the spell permanent until dispelled by using a citrine worth at least 10 gp as a material component; the citrine is consumed in the casting.
