#### Skulking Spy

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you would make a Dexterity check for initiative
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
At the moment hostilities begin, you can
immediately seek to evade your foes' notice. As part
of the reaction used to cast this spell, you can move
up to your speed without provoking opportunity
attacks, before initiative is resolved. If you have any
cover or concealment at the end of this movement,
you can take the Hide action as part of the same
reaction, and you can even attempt to hide from
creatures who saw you move.
