You imbue one creature that you touch with magic that surrounds them with breathable air and allows them to traverse water and aquatic environments with ease. Until the spell ends, the target gains a swimming speed of 60 feet, the amount of time it can hold its breath is tripled, and it does not suffer disadvantage on attack rolls for being underwater. It also ignores difficult terrain and light obscurement caused by the presence of water (such as when wading in still water) though it does not ignore the effects of water currents.

In addition, the target has advantage on saving throws made to resist the [drown](drown.md), [scalding sphere](), and [watery sphere]() spells for the duration.

***At Higher Levels.***When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd
