You gather powerful winds to raise you into the air, giving you a ﬂy speed of 60 feet for the duration. In addition, for the duration, ranged attacks with physical projectiles are made with disadvantage against you and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws made against area effects based on physical projectiles. When the spell ends, you fall if you are still aloft unless you can stop the fall.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the ﬂy speed increases by 30 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
