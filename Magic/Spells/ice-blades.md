- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure three snowflakes the size of saw 
blades in your space. The blades spin in the air and 
orbit around you for the duration.

When you cast this spell and as a bonus action on 
each of your turns thereafter, you can launch any 
number of the blades toward one or more targets 
within 120 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack for
each blade. On a hit, a blade deals 1d8 slashing 
damage and 2d4 cold damage. Regardless of whether
an attack hits or misses, all blades return to your 
space immediately after the attack.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, you create one 
additional blade for each slot level above 4th.
