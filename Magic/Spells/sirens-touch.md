---
You create a wave of haunting music that strikes at one creature of your choice that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you and then take 1d8 psychic damage if it is within 5 feet of you. The target is immune to the spell if it can't hear the caster. The target cannot be pulled further than it could move with its speed.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
