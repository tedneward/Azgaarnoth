___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You fire an icicle at a target within range. Your
target takes 1d4 cold damage and must make a
Constitution saving throw. If they fail, the target is
vulnerable to cold damage until the end of your
next turn. If the target successfully saves they take
damage but are otherwise unaffected. If the target is
immune to cold damage, they make this save
automatically.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you increase the
damage by 1d4 for spell slot above 1st. If you use a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the target is
vulnerable to cold damage for 1 minute.
