Intense ﬂames wreathe around every Large or smaller creature of your choice you can see within range. Each affected creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 12d6 fire damage and is set [ablaze](../../Conditions/Ablaze.md). On a successful save, the creature takes half damage. Also on a failed save, a creature burns for the duration. When a burning creature ends its turn, it makes a Dexterity saving throw; the creature takes 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful save.

A burning creature sheds bright in a 30-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

These magical ﬂames can’t be extinguished by nonmagical means.

If damage from this spell kills a creature, it is turned to ash.
