#### Alternate Reality
*3rd-level divination* (Cleric,Paladin,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You touch an ally, and for an instant reality alters itself to suit their desires.

Until the end of your next turn, one creature you touch can choose to reroll one attack roll, one saving throw, and one skill check. Whenever the target uses the effects of this spell to reroll, it must use the second roll even if it is worse. Any rerolls not used before the start of your next turn are lost.
