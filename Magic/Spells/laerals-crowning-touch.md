---
You magically inscribe a glowing symbol of Mystra, goddess of magic, on a creature, cursing it with that goddess's fury. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. Creatures that cast spells as a bard, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard (including arcane tricksters and eldritch knights) make this saving throw at disadvantage. On a failure, until the spell ends, the target has disadvantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks, all spell attack rolls, and all saving throws against spells. For the same duration, all saving throws against spells cast by the target are made at advantage, and the symbol you inscribed on the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius around it.

While a target is under the effects of this spell, each time it casts a spell of 1st-level or higher, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes damage equal to twice the spell's level. Whenever a creature with hair takes this damage, streaks of silver appear in its hair. If this damage reduces it to 0 hit points, the target's hair becomes completely silver.

The inscribed symbol of Mystra appears drawn in silver on each palm (or on the chest and forehead of beings lacking palms).

This spell cannot be dispelled by any other spell except for [wish](./wish.md), but it can be countered by [counterspell](./counterspell.md). When this spell ends, all of its effects end as well, except for any changes to the target's hair, which remain permanently as if they were the target's natural hair color.
