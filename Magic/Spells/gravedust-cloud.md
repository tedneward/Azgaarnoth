#### Gravedust Cloud
*6th-level necromancy* (Cleric,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bag of ashes from a burnt corpse)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You propel a bag of ashes at your foes, which
explodes in a pale cloud that saps the life out of
creatures and transfers it to your allies.
Each hostile creature of your choice in a 30-foot-
radius sphere centered on a point you choose
within range must make a Constitution saving
throw. A target takes 5d8 necrotic damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. Choose up to six creatures in the same 30-foot-
radius sphere. Each target regains temporary hit
points equal to half the necrotic damage you rolled
(whether any creature fails its saving throw or not).
This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level
above 6th.
