You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the whip that has a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, the target takes 3d4 bludgeoning damage, or you can choose to trip the target, dealing it no damage and knocking it prone instead.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the reach of the spell attack increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can conjure a second whip in another hand as part of the same bonus action, and with two whips you can make two spell attacks using your action instead of only one.
