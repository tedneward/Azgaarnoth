---
When initiative is rolled, and you
aren't surprised, you can use a
reaction to cause a blinding
flash of
light to
erupt in a
15-foot
radius at a
point you
can see
within range. Each creature caught in the area must make a
Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on
the initiative roll and on attack rolls until the end of
their next turn.
Creatures that don't rely on eyesight are immune
to this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the
effect increases by 5 feet for every slot level above
2nd.
