#### Acid Cloud
*3rd-level conjuration* (Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure a cloud of acidic vapor over the head of one creature you can see within range. The cloud follows the target as it moves and sprays acid upon it periodically. At the start of each of the target's turns while the cloud remains, the target and each other creature in the target's space must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 acid damage.

The cloud lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. If the target ends any of its turns at least 50 feet away from where it began that turn, the spell immediately ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.
