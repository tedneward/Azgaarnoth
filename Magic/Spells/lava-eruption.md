*4th-level transmutation* (Druid,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bottle carved of obsidian)
- **Duration:** Concentration, 1 minute
---
Choose a point you can see on the ground within
range. A fountain of liquid hot magma erupts in a
20-foot sphere centered on that point. For the
duration, the area of the spell (including all
portions of that area, above the ground or beneath
it) becomes difficult terrain, and the lava ignites
flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn
or carried.
A creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and
3d6 fire damage when it enters the spell's area for
the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.
After the spell ends, the area of the spell remains
difficult terrain until it is cleared. Each 5-foot-
square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute
to clear by hand.
Firenewts or earth-based or fire-based elemental
creatures (such as gargoyles or salamanders) do not
take damage from this spell. Instead, such a
creature is healed, regaining hit points equal to half
the fire damage inflicted. Only firenewts or
creatures of the elemental type can benefit from
this effect.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning
damage and fire damage each increase by 1d6 for
each level above 4th.
