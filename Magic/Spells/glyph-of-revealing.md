#### Glyph of Revealing
*2nd-level transmutation* (Artificer,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (special ink made of the juice of crushed eyebright, white chalk, and crushed quartz)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
Using the specially prepared ink, you inscribe a
glyph onto a horizontal surface, which can be a
shield. Once the glyph is completed, it glows with a
bright light for a moment and then fades from view.
However, for the duration, all glyphs, symbols,
magical runes, secret pages, or other magical
writing within 120 feet that are not behind total
cover glow with white light. The glyph of revealing
can be moved safely for the duration without
ending the spell.

This spell reveals magical glyphs and symbols but
doesn't prevent them from being triggered if
conditions are met.
