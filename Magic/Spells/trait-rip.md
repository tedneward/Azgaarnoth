---
You can rob a creature of one of its unique traits
and give it to an ally. Make a melee spell attack
against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you
choose one special or racial trait which you know
the creature possesses (such as one you have seen it
use) and remove it from the creature until the spell
ends. For example, if you removed the Amphibious
trait from an aboleth or a water genasi, that
creature would no longer be able to breathe both air
and water.
When you cast this spell, you choose a second
target, which must be another willing creature
within 30 feet. Until the spell ends, that creature
gains the racial or special trait you removed from
the first target.
However, the Ability Score Increase racial trait,
Legendary Resistance, Innate Spellcasting, or
Spellcasting traits are not affected by this spell, nor
are any other traits that are either not listed under
the traits section of the stat block or not listed
among the traits it receives for being a member of a
certain race. You could not, for example, remove an
action or legendary action with this spell, nor could
you remove its Armor Class or Passive Perception.
The DM may also rule that certain traits are too
intrinsic to the nature of a creature to be removed,
such as the Water Form trait of a water elemental.
However, if a creature has no traits you can affect
with this spell, the DM will inform you before you
use an action to cast the spell.
At the end of each of the first target's turns, it can
make a Constitution saving throw against the spell.
On a success, the spell ends.
