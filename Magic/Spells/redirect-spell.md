- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10
---
minutes
You create a magical connection
between yourself and an ally, such that any
spells that would harm the ally are redirected to
you. Touch a willing creature when you cast this
spell. Whenever you are within 15 feet of that
creature, and it is forced to make a saving throw
against a spell, or it is targeted by a spell attack, the
spell targets you instead. If the spell forces a saving
throw, you make your own saving throw against it
and undergo its effects for a success or failure. If
the spell is an attack, the attack roll is made against
you.
This spell ends early if the chosen creature is ever
more than a mile away from you.
