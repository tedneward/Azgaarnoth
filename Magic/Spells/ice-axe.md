When you cast this spell, a battleaxe of swirling ice appears in your hand. You are proficient with the axe, and you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using it. On a hit, a target takes 1d12 cold damage in addition to the axe's magical slashing damage.

You cannot be disarmed of the ice axe; if you should drop it, it flies back to your hand immediately.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d12 for every two slot levels above 3rd.
