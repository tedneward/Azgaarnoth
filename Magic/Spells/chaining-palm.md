---
You make a melee spell attack against a Large or smaller creature you can see. On a hit, translucent chains of solid magical force wrap around the creature, making the creature restrained for the duration. When the creature starts a turn, it can choose to make a Strength saving throw or Dexterity saving throw. After making two successful saves against this spell while restrained, the spell ends. You can use an action on your turn to reinforce the chains if the creature is within 30 feet of you, applying disadvantage on the creatureâ€™s next saving throw. If the creature takes damage from an attack or area effect originating from a source other than the creature itself, the spell ends.The chains themselves have an AC of 18 and 40 hit points. The chains shed bright light out to 5 feet, and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can use the spell on a Huge creature. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, you can use the spell on a Gargantuan creature no larger than a 30-foot cube. The AC of the chains increases by 2 and the hit points by 10 for each slot level above 3rd.
