An invisible ray shoots from your hand toward a target within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target can't cast spells, nor can it be targeted by other spells for the duration. Any spell affecting the target is suppressed for the duration, though it is not dispelled, and resumes when the antimagic ray spell expires.

If a magic item is targeted by the ray, its magical properties are suppressed for the duration.
