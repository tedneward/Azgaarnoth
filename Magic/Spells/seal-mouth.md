#### Seal Mouth
*2nd-level enchantment* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Until dispelled
---
Choose one creature you choose within range. Until
the spell ends, whenever the creature speaks of you,
even indirectly, it must make a Wisdom saving
throw if it would say anything about you that would
be considered critical, incriminating, or negative in
any way. On a failure, its words come out as
nonsensical stories or children's nursery rhymes
from which no relevant meaning can be discerned.
If the creature succeeds on this Wisdom saving
throw, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th or 5th level, the spell does not end
until the creature has succeeded on the Wisdom
saving throw twice. If the spell slot is 6th level or
higher, the spell does not end until the creature has
succeeded on the Wisdom saving throw three times.
