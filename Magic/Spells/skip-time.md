If you have already willingly moved this turn, this
spell fails. You shunt away some time from the
current moment, stealing it from yourself now to
grant yourself an extra opportunity to act in the
future. Once you cast this spell, your speed is
halved until the end of this turn. After the end of
this turn, you gain the following benefits, which last
until the end of your next turn:
* Your speed is doubled
* You gain a +2 bonus to AC
* You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws
* You gain an additional action during your turn.
That action can be used only to take one of the
following actions: Attack (one weapon attack
only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object.
Each time you cast this spell, if you have
previously cast it one or more times within the past
minute, you suffer 1 level of exhaustion.
