# Asmodeus' Enteral Suffering
*9th-level evocation* (Cleric, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 666 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Special

You call upon the Supreme Master of the Nine Hells to mark an unfortunate soul for unending torment. Make a ranged spell against a target you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 12d8 fire damage and the symbol of Asmodeus is branded into their forehead for 1 minute. The creature takes 6d8 fire damage each time takes an action while it is branded in this manner.

If a creature is killed while under the effects of this spell, its soul becomes eternally damned. At the start of your next turn, the creature's soul rises as a [shadow demon](/Creatures/Demon-Shadow.md) that is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it.

Any creature who is killed by this spell can be restored to life only by means of a [wish](/Magic/Spells/wish.md) spell if the shadow demon has been slain.
