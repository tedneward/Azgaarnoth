A small bolt of lightning is unleashed from your hand, moving around corners to seek out a target. The closest hostile creature with at least one path available between it and you (not necessarily a straight path) must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d6 lightning damage, or half damage on a success. You do not need line of sight for this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you increase the damage by 1d6 for each slot level higher than 1st.
