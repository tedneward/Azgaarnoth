A brightly glowing image of two rotating circles of glyphs appears, then a vertical column of disorienting indigo luminescence erupts from one circle to the other. Each creature in a 10-ft. radius, 40-foot cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature is restrained on a failed save, and must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns. Three successful saves end the spell. Three failed saves result in the target turning to stone permanently and being subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures donâ€™t need to be consecutive.
