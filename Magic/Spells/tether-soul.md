---
Choose one creature that you can see within range. You use mysterious magic to temporarily reinforce the bond between the target's soul and its corporeal body. 

While the spell lasts, the target has advantage on all death saving throws and on any saving throws to resist being possessed, teleported, or sent to another plane. In addition, when it takes damage while it is at 0 hit points, it can roll a death saving throw instead of automatically suffering a failure. A success on this death saving throw doesn't count towards becoming stable. The target also suffers no extra failures for being critically hit. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the range increases by 30 feet for each slot level above 2nd. If you use a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 2nd.
