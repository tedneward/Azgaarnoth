#### Eldritch Isolation
*4th-level conjuration* (Paladin,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
With a strike of your weapon, your battle magic
transports your opponent with you to another area
where you may continue duelling. As part of the
action used to cast this spell, you must make a
melee attack with a weapon against one creature
within 5 feet of you, otherwise the spell fails.
On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal
effects, and you and the target are each teleported
to an unoccupied space of your choice within 30
feet. Your new space and that of the creature you
take with you must be within 5 feet of each other. If
either of you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, the spell fails to
teleport either of you.
