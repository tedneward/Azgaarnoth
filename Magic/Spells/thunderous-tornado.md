You emit a massive roaring cyclone, a cone of swirling winds and lighting in a line 500 feet long and 25 feet wide that blasts away all in its deadly path. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11d10 lightning damage and 11d10 thunder damage, is pushed 50 feet away from you, and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed or knocked prone.

The spell damages and pushes objects in the area.
