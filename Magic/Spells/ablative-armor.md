#### Ablative Armor
*1st-level abjuration* (Artificer,Cleric,Paladin)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of shattered armor)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You touch one suit of armor, which hardens with an
extra layer of protection against attacks. The armor
gains temporary hit points equal to 1d4 + your
spellcasting ability modifier. While the armor still
has these temporary hit points, its wearer has
resistance to all damage except psychic damage.
Each time the wearer takes damage that is not
psychic damage, the same amount of damage is
dealt to the armor's hit points.
The spell ends early if the temporary hit points
are depleted, if the armor is doffed, or if the spell is
cast again on the same suit of armor. You can also
dismiss the spell as an action.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the temporary hit
points increase by 5 for each slot level above 1st.
