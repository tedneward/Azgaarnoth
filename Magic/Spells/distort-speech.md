#### Distort Speech
*1st-level transmutation* (Bard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You point at a creature within range and speak a
verse of utter gibberish. The creature must make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
must make a Charisma saving throw against your
spellcasting DC whenever it tries to cast a spell with
verbal components, to speak a command word to
activate an item, or to read a scroll, for the spell's
duration. On a failed save, the creature utters
gibberish instead of the required component,
command word, or scroll wording, and its action is
wasted without producing the desired effect.
In addition, if a creature fails its Wisdom saving
throw, it has disadvantage on all Charisma ability
checks when interacting with other creatures as it
speaks gibberish mixed with its more intelligible
words. The creature can attempt a new saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, and on a
success, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one
extra creature for every two slot levels above 1st.
