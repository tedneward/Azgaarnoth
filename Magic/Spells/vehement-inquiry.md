*5th-level enchantment (ritual)* (Bard, Paladin, Warlock)

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of the target's blood)

**Duration:** Up to 1 hour

You can attempt to force a creature to truthfully answer your questions. Upon casting this spell, you immediately gain 1d4+1 levels of exhaustion.

If your current level of exhaustion does not result in your death, roll 1d4. This is the number of questions you can ask the target. After each question is asked, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw before it answers. You do not know if the target succeeds on their save. If the target fails its save, it must answer your question briefly in a truthful manner, while not providing any misleading information or it will take 4d6 psychic damage. If the target does not know the answer, it must say so or take 4d6 psychic damage as if it were lying. If the target succeeds the save, it can answer the question in any manner it wishes and does not take damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the number of questions increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 5th.
