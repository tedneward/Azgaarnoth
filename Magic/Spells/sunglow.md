You shed bright light from your body in a 120-foot radius. This light counts as sunlight for the purposes of the [Floramancer](/Classes/Wizard/Floramancer.md)'s photosynthesis feature, undead effects, or any other side-effect of being exposed to bright sunlight. Any creature within 30 feet of you has disadvantage on attacks made against you. Any creature starting its turn within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become blinded. The blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The blinded condition automatically ends if the blinded creature leaves the spellâ€™s area of effect.
