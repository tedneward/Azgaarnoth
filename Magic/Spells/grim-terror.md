- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:**Self (30 feet) 
- **Components:** S, M (your own blood, from a wound) 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 
---
Your blood projects a grisly image of primal terror. Each creature other than you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4d10 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you for the duration. On a successful saving throw, it takes half as much damage and isn't frightened.

While a creature is frightened by the spelL it is incaÂ­pacitated, it can't move, and all attacks made against it have advantage. It makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful saving throw, it is no longer frightened by the spell.

The spell fails if you don't have blood. If you have less than half of your hit points remaining, you can choose to have the spell extend out to 45 feet instead of 30 feet. 

This spell has no effect on constructs and undead.

This is a Blood spell.
