#### Servant of Flame
*3rd-level conjuration* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You summon a group of four [magma mephits](../../Creatures/Mephit.md#magma) which appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Each mephit that remains when the spell ends vanishes without a trace.

The summoned mephits are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the mephits as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you summon 1d4 additional mephits for each slot level above 3rd.
