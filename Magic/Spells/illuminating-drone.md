A ï¬‚oating, intangible, tiny orb of light appears in your space, hovering near your body and moving as you will it. As a bonus action, you can mentally command the orb to move up 30 feet in a path of your choice. If the orb is in your space, you can command it to automatically follow in your space as you move; giving the orb another command will cancel the automated movement. The orb will disappear if it separates more than 100 feet away from you, but you can use a bonus action to make the orb re-appear in your space. The orb, when the spell is cast, produces bright light out in a 20 foot radius, and dim light for an additional 20 feet. As a bonus action you can mentally command the orb to reduce its illumination, down to bright light in a 5-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

As a bonus action you can mentally command the orb to increase its illumination to as much as bright light in a 40-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 40 feet.
