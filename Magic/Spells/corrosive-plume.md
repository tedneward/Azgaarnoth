A wave of acidic gas erupts from your hands in a line 100 feet long and 15 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 13d6 acid damage, and if it is wearing nonmagical armor that isn't adamantine, that armor is dissolved and destroyed. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and nothing else. 

The spell damages objects in the area.
