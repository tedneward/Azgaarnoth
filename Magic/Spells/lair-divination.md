- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of coins, incense, and the caster's holy symbol)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You focus on a location that you know about on the same plane of existence, gaining insight into the relative strength of creatures guarding the area and the amount of treasure stored there. You do not gain any knowledge regarding the numbers of creatures or the exact amount of treasure. However, you do gain a sense of the overall challenge and reward levels based upon your party's strength.

The Dungeon Master has free reign in determining the results of this spell. For example, the DM could state that the spellcaster has a feeling that the dangers are more dangerous compared to another location the characters had previously explored, but the rewards are also better.
