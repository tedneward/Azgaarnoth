#### Great Shout
*8th-level evocation* (Bard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (an item that radiates a magic aura)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You grip an item that radiates
magic as you focus all your effort
into a great shout that sends forth a
tremendous blast in a direction you
choose. Each creature and object (attended or not)
in a 90-foot cone radiating out from you must make
a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature or object takes 10d6 thunder damage;
creatures are also deafened for 1 minute. On a
successful save a creature takes half the damage and
isn't deafened.

A creature made of inorganic material such as
stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this
saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn't being
worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the
spell's area, including walls, pillars, doors, and
gates. The sound of this spell can be heard up to 1
mile away (or farther with a successful Wisdom
(Perception) check as determined by your DM).
However, this spell can be costly and dangerous
to cast. As soon as the spell is cast, you must make a
successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a
failed save, you suffer two levels of exhaustion. On a
successful save, you suffer no ill effects.
