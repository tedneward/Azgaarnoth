# Animate Percussion
*1st-level transmutation* (ritual) (Bard, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a small cymbal or drum)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You may touch one percussion instrument that you possess, bringing it to life under your command for the duration. The instrument can only follow basic commands, such as playing a simple beat. As a bonus action, you can mentally command the instrument you made with this spell if it is within 30 feet of you. Once given an order, the instrument continues to follow it until its task is complete. If you do not issue a command, the instrument will idly play a rhythm that it has been used to play prior to becoming animated.
