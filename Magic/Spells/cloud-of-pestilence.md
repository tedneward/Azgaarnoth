#### Cloud of Pestilence
*4th-level conjuration* (Cleric,Warlock)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a heavily obscured 15-foot radius sphere
of yellow-green fog centered on a point you can see
within range. The fog spreads around corners but is
stationary and lasts the duration unless dispersed
by a strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour), which
ends the spell after 1 round .

When a creature first enters the cloud or starts its
turn there, that creature must make a Constitution
saving throw or take 4d6 poison damage or half as
much on a successful save. Creatures are affected
even if they hold their breath or don't need to
breathe.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th or higher level, the poison damage
increases by 1d6 and the radius increases by 5 feet
for each slot level above 4th.
