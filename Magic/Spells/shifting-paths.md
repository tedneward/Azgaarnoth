*8th-level illusion* *(ritual)* (Cleric,Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 8 hours
---
This spell hides a path or road that you choose,
while also creating an illusory path that starts at a
point you choose within range. The illusory path
continues in a direction you choose for up to a
number of miles equal to 2 Ã— your spellcasting
ability modifier. This illusory path avoids obstacles,
and does not provide bridges, stairs, ladders, ramps,
or other methods to travel through impassable
terrain. The path will not cross cliffs or rivers more
than four feet deep.
A creature following the original path must make
a Wisdom saving throw when it comes to the start
of the illusory path. On a failed save, the creature
follows the illusory path as if it were the real one. If
the path moves through difficult terrain, the
creature believes the path slopes and twists to
justify its reduction in speed.
On a successful save, the creature sees both
paths, but the illusory path appears shadowy.
