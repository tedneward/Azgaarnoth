___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of salt)

---
The target becomes immune to diseases and
poisons for 24 hours. This grants immunity to
poison damage and the poisoned condition, as well
as the effects of actual poisons and diseases,
whatever those effects may be. The target is
immune even if the disease or poison is magical.
Any poison or disease already in the target is placed
in a form of stasis until the spell ends, then resumes
just as if the spell was never cast.
