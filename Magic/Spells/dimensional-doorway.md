# Dimensional Doorway
*3rd-level conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a miniature doorknocker)

**Duration**: 10 minutes

You create a dimensional doorway 7 feet high and 4 feet wide, on any surface. Upon opening the door, it creates a space up to 5 feet deep through the surface material. If there is an open space beyond the surface, the doorway acts as a means of egress. Only you can pass through the doorway. To all other creatures this appears to be a translucent illusion over the otherwise solid surface.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, one additional creature you touch can use the door for each slot level above 3rd.
