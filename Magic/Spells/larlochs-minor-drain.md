# Larloch's Minor Drain
*1st-level necromancy* (Pale Master, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a ball of necrotic energy and launch it towards a creature that you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. If you are at your maximum total hit points, you receive double the amount as temporary hit points instead.
