*4th-level evocation* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You create a globe of force that streaks unerringly
toward a target you can see within range. The target
takes 2d6 force damage, and the globe explodes in a
concussive blast. The target and each creature
within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 force
damage, or half as much on a successful save.
Objects within range automatically miss the saving
throw.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage from
the blast increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
4th.
