As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the
spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's
normal effects and takes an additional 1d6 force
damage as links of solid eldritch energy burst from
its flesh, binding its bones to the ground. The
creature you hit is restrained until the end of its
next turn.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial extra
damage dealt by the attack increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 1st.
