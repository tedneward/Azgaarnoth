You create a powerful illusion to copy the appearance and abilities of one willing humanoid that you can see within range. If the target can't be charmed, the spell fails. Otherwise, the illusion appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and it lasts until it is reduced to 0 hit points or the spell ends.

The illusion looks and sounds exactly like the target did when the spell was cast, including any equipment it was carrying or wearing. Roll initiative for the illusion, which has its own turns. Its statistics are identical to the statistics that the target had when the spell was cast, except that it can't cast spells, activate magic items, use features or traits that recharge on a short or long rest, or restore hit points to a creature or object. It gains the benefits from any magic items the target had equipped, but the items are illusions and disappear if removed.

The illusion is under your control: it acts the same as how the target would act, except it is charmed by you and treats you as a close friend. The illusion can't move more than 150 feet away from you. If it ends its turn more than 300 feet away from you, the spell ends.

A creature that uses an action to examine the illusion can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. Creatures that don't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or that can see through illusions, as with truesight, can automatically discern the illusion's true nature, and they have resistance to damage caused by the illusion as well as advantage on attack rolls against the illusion.
