---
You summon an avalanche of snow out of a rift in
mid-air, burying your foes in icy graves. Choose a
point within range. The ground within a 60-foot
sphere centered on that point is covered in snow
and becomes difficult terrain for 1 hour. In addition,
all creatures within a 40-foot radius sphere centered
on the sam epoint must make a Dexterity saving
throw. The effects of the saving throw depend on a
creature's distance from the center of the effect.
A creature within a 20-foot radius sphere from
the point you chose who fails its saving throw takes
10d12 cold damage and 10d12 bludgeoning damage,
and it is buried in the snow (with effects as
described below), or it takes half damage and isn't
buried on a successful save.
A creature outside of the 20-foot radius sphere,
but within 40 feet of its center, who fails its saving
throw takes 5d12 cold and 5d12 bludgeoning
damage, is pushed 20 feet away from the center
point, and falls prone. On a successful saving throw,
the creature takes half as much damage and is
pushed only 10 feet from the center point. Any
creature that fails its saving throw by 5 or more is
also buried in the snow.
A creature buried in the snow is restrained, and it
is surrounded by snow that provides full cover. On
its turn, a buried creature can use its action to make
a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a
success, it frees itself. Other creatures within 5-feet
of a buried creature can attemt to dig it out, but
freeing one buried creature requires one or more
others to use a total of ten actions digging. This can
be one creature using ten actions, five creatures
using two actions each, or some other combination
that equals a total of ten actions, over however
many rounds this requires.
Structures and inanimate objects in the area
suffer the same effects as creatures, which often
causes small trees to be uprooted and structures to
collapse. Even after the snow melts, rubble and
other detritus are left behind. All flames in the area
are extinguished, whether they are magical or not.
