#### Banishing Ray
*5th-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A ray of violet light is shot from your pointed finger. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see. If the creature is hit, it must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature is blinded on a failed save, and must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness while a failed save transports the creature to another plane of existence and also ends the blindness. (If the creature was not on its home plane, it will typically be banished home, while other creatures will be sent to the Astral or Ethereal planes.) If the creature is native to the plane of existence you are currently on, it can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the creature returns to the same location where it was banished, or the closest unoccupied space if the original location is occupied.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you produce an additional ray for every two slot levels above 5th. Each ray can target the same or different targets.
