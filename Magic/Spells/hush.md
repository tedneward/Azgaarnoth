___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:**30 feet 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 
---
You shroud one creature that you can see within range in quieting magic. If the target is willing and you touch the target as part of casting the spell, it is affected by the spell. Otherwise, it must make a Charisma saving throw, becoming affected only on a failed saving throw, and then repeating the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success. 

Until the spell ends, the target and any objects that it is wearing or carrying can't produce sound of any kind. The target can't speak and is unable to provide verbal components, but it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and it can't suffer any disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks caused by armor. In addition, it can choose to use your spellcasting ability modifier instead of its Dexterity modifier for Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
