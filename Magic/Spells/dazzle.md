You create a flash of blinding light directly in front of a
creature that you can see within range. The target is
subjected to a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it has
disadvantage on its next attack, or grants advantage on the
next attack made against it, whichever comes first.
The target must be able to see in order to suffer these
effects.
