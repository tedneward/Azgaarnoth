# Reveille
*7th-level conjuration* (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a war horn)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon warriors to fight for you and your allies with a blast through a war horn that calls them to arms. Choose between a [Knight](/Creatures/Knight.md) or a [Veteran](/Creatures/Veteran.md); the chosen creature appears within range, as well as a squad of auxiliary warriors composed of 2d4+4 Guards or Bandits, respectively.

The summoned warriors are friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the warriors, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the warriors, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the warriors don't disappear. Instead, you lose command of them, and they become neutral to you and your companions, following the command of the Knight or Veteran (as appropriate). Uncontrolled warriors can't be dismissed by you and disappear 1 hour after they are summoned. The DM has the warriors' statistics.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level, the number of auxiliary warriors you may summon increases to 2d6+6. When you cast it using a spell slot of 9th level, this number increases to 2d8+8, or you may summon 12 auxiliary warriors and an additional Knight or Veteran, which must be of the same type as the initial choice.
