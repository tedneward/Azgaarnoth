___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You form a ﬂoating, spinning disc of solid, indestructible magical force above your head, which then rapidly ﬂies towards a creature, object, or structure of your choice you can see. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 10d8 + 20 slashing damage. If a creature hit with this spell currently has its speed reduced to 0 or can’t move, then an otherwise normal hit with this spell becomes a critical hit. If an unattended object or structure is attacked with this spell, you have advantage on the attack roll; in addition, a normal hit against an unattended object or structure is a critical hit unless the object or structure is a magic item or magically reinforced structure.
