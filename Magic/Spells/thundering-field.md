Thunderous, deafening noises abound in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you can see. When a creature enters or starts its turn in the affected area, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is deafened until its next turn. Tremorsense can not be used to detect creatures within the cube or within 30 feet of the cube.
