This spell allows you to temporarily ignore the
effects of exhaustion. For the duration, all levels of
exhaustion are ignored, but not removed. You do
not gain the benefits of a rest without actually
resting, but you do not need to sleep. When the
spell ends you must make a Constitution saving
throw. If you fail you gain one level of exhaustion.
