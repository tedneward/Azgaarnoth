You may only cast this spell once per day, before you start preparing your spells for the day. Choose up to three levels of spells (three first level spells, one first level spell and one second level spell, or one third level spell) from any other class's spell list. You must have seen these spells being cast within the last year.

Until your next long rest, you treat the selected spells as if they belonged to your class's spell list, and you may prepare those spells normally.

You cannot copy them into your spellbook from the effects of this spell.
