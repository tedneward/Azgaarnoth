# Devastate Undead
*4th-level necromancy* (Pale Master, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You siphon out the foul life-force instilled in undead creatures within range. Roll 5d20; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Undead creatures within 30 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points.

Starting with the undead creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be destroyed. Subtract each undead creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the undead creature with the next lowest hit points. An undead creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the hit point total of the first undead creature that was destroyed by this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, roll an additional 1d20 for each slot level above 4th.
