When this spell is cast you may conjure a
hemisphere with a 20-foot diameter or a 20 foot by
20 foot wall. Once the shape has been chosen it
cannot be changed. Either shape is made out of
crackling bolts of lightning. A creature that comes
into contact with either shape must make Dexterity
saving throw. The creature takes 4d8 electrical
damage and makes their next saving throw with
disadvantage on a failed save, and takes half as
much damage and may roll saves without
disadvantage on a successful one. Any creature
wearing metal armor makes this save with
disadvantage.
