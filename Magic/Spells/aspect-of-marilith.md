As you finish casting this spell, swirls of smoke and force emanate from your arms until they form into an additional arm each, giving you temporarily 2 extra arms that can each wield a one handed weapon.

As part of the casting, each arm can draw a sheathed weapon as part of the casting, or it can make an Unarmed Strike. The arms have the same Strength as you do, and if an effect would normally cause you to lose to use of an arm, you can choose to lose one of the temporary arms instead.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to have each of your arms make a single melee attack.

In addition, the extra arms each gain Reactions, either to Parry a melee attack that would hit you (+3 AC against the triggering attack, potentially causing it to miss), or to make an opportunity attack. Each arm can only use one Reaction per turn, and you can take only one Reaction for any given action.

You still only benefit from one shield, and the arms cannot use any ammunition-based ranged weapon if you are engaged in melee combat. 

While this spell is active, you have advantage on any ability checks or saving throws related to climbing, you have advantage on Grappling checks, and you can still use somatic components for spellcasting when Grappled.

If your concentration is broken, the arms immediately disappear, dropping whatever they were holding.

***At Higher Levelâ€‹s.*** If you cast this spell with a 7th-level spell slot, you grow 3 extra arms, and if you cast this spell with a 9th-level slot, you grow 4 extra arms.
