#### Monstrous Thrall
*9th-level enchantment* (Bard,Cleric,Warlock)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
Select a non-humanoid target that you can see
within range. The target must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If it fails the save, the target is
charmed and under your mental control (as if under
the effects of the dominate monster  spell).
Unlike the dominate monster  spell, this effect
doesn't grant the monster a saving throw whenever
it takes damage. However, if you give the creature
an order that is suicidal, self-destructive, or against
its very nature (such as ordering a celestial to
murder innocents), it can make another saving
throw with disadvantage to resist the order. If the
creature makes its saving throw, though it doesn't
obey that particular order, it is still your thrall.
However, all future saving throws made to resist
that order are made with advantage.
If you maintain your concentration for
the full duration, the effect is
permanent.
