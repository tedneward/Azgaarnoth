You produce a set of connected stairs made of ice leading up a direction of your choice, and starting from an unoccupied space within range on a solid surface. The stairs may be diagonal or spiral upwards, filling unoccupied spaces until blocked by a creature or object. The maximum height that you can place the top of the stairs is 60 feet. The stairs can be made wide enough to accommodate Large or smaller creatures. The individual steps that make up the stairs are each up to 15 feet long, 1 foot wide, and 6 inches thick. They each have an AC of 12, 15 hit points, and are vulnerable to fire. The stairs may need to connect with another structure to maintain their integrity, depending on how much weight is placed on them. They can support up to 800 lb. per step. When the spell ends or is dismissed, the stairway turns to mist and anything on it falls.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a slot of 5th level or higher, then you increase the maximum height by 10 feet per level higher than 4th.
