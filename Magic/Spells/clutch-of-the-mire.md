---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the
spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's
normal effects, and its speed is reduced by half until
the end of your next turn. Whether or not the
attack hits, your weapon strikes the ground,
opening up a shallow bog which hinders movement.
A 15-foot cube that includes the space occupied by
the target of your attack becomes difficult terrain
until the end of your next turn.
Whenever a creature ends its turn within difficult
terrain created by this spell, it must make a
Strength saving throw. Creatures wearing medium
or heavy armor have disadvantage on this save. On
a failure, until the end of the creature's next turn its
speed is reduced by 10 feet and it cannot take
reactions or bonus actions. On a success, the
creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end
of its next turn, but it suffers no other effects.
