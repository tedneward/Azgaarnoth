A 20-foot radius sphere of dirty ice plummets to the ground on a point you can see within range. Each creature in the area of impact must make a Strength saving throw. A creature which fails its save takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not fall prone. Objects in the area are also damaged. The comet dissolves immediately after impact.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
