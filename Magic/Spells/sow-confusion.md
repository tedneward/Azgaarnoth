#### Sow Confusion
*2nd-level illusion* (Bard,Ranger,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Creatures around you find their attention drawn
elsewhere, allowing you to slip away. Until the end
of the turn, all Wisdom (Perception) checks to
perceive you are made at disadvantage. In addition,
each creature of your choice that you can see must
make a Wisdom saving throw. Non-hostile
creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw,
but creatures immune to being charmed
automatically succeed.
If even one creature fails the save, you can
immediately move up to your speed without
provoking opportunity attacks. You can move
through the spaces of hostile creatures during this
movement as if they were friendly. If you have any
cover or concealment at the end of this movement,
you can take the Hide action as part of the same
bonus action used to cast this spell, with this Hide
action allowing you to attempt to hide from
creatures who saw you move.
