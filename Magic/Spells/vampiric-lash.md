A bright red whip of energy writhes in your hand.
Make a melee spell attack against a creature in
range. If you hit your target takes 6d6 necrotic
damage and must make a Constitution saving
throw. If they fail your target is grappled as long as
the lash is wrapped around it. If you use the lash to
attack another target, the initial target is released
from the grapple. The target can repeat the
Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn to
end the grapple. For every point of damage you
inflict with this spell you gain 1 temporary hit point,
up to a maximum of 10.
