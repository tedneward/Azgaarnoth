---
The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack
during this spell's duration, your attack deals an
extra 1d8 magical piercing damage. In addition,
when you deal this extra damage, the target and two
other creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you
or the target take psychic damage equal to your
spellcasting ability modifier. When a creature takes
this psychic damage, the next time it makes an
attack that does not target you before the start of your next turn, it has disadvantage on the attack
roll.
