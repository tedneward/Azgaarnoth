---
You name your foe an enemy of the faith,
searing it with divine power that heals any who
strike it. Choose one creature within range,
which must make a Charisma saving throw,
taking 4d6 radiant damage on a failure or half
as much damage on a success. If the target
fails, the next time an ally hits that target with an
attack roll before the spell ends, that ally regains a
number of hit points equal to 1d8 plus your
spellcasting ability modifier. The spell ends at the
end of your next turn after you cast it.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level of higher, you can choose
one additional creature within range to make the
Charisma saving throw for each slot level above
2nd.
