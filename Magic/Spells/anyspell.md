*4th-level transmutation* (Cleric,Wizard)
___

- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
This spell grants you the ability to cast any one spell of your choice from the wizard spell list, provided it is a 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th level spell. As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must read the spell you intend to cast directly from a scroll or a wizard's spellbook, or the spell fails (reading from a spell scroll in this way does not use the spell scroll).

Once you cast *anyspell*, the spell you chose and read can be cast any time until the end of your next turn, using the required casting time and components. (Therefore, spells that take longer than 1 round to cast are usually not suitable choices this spell.) To cast the chosen spell, you must still expend a spell slot of the appropriate level.
