Make a melee or ranged spell attack (your choice)
against the creature that dealt the triggering
damage. If the attack roll hits, the target takes 4d4
force damage, and you regain a number of hit
points equal to the force damage you inflict. If the
attack roll misses, you take necrotic damage equal
to your level, which cannot be reduced or redirected
by any means. If damage from this spell reduces you
to 0 hit points, you immediately fail one death save.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of or higher, the force damage inflicted
increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.
