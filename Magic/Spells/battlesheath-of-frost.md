---
Swirling frigid air sheathes your hand but does not freeze you. If you are wielding a weapon in the sheathed hand, the air sheathes the weapon as well if you so desire. If you make a melee attack against a creature or object with the air-sheathed hand/weapon, you deal an additional 1d6 cold damage on a hit. When you deal the cold damage, the air is dissipated immediately afterwards, but you can re-sheathe your hand (and weapon) with a bonus action.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you increase the damage by 1d6 for every two slot levels higher than 1st.
