A non-magical object of Large size or smaller comes to life at your command, in the form of a manifested [mimic](/Creatures/Mimic.md). The mimic is charmed by you until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed mimic regards you as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the mimic isn't under your control, it takes your requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.

The manifested mimic can understand the languages of its creator. It prefers to remain in its false appearance until instructed otherwise. The size of the object used in the spell dictates its combat statistics. A medium object becomes has the same statistics as a mimic. Other sizes of manifested mimics have different combat statistics (all statistics are as they appear in the mimic's stat block unless different below).
