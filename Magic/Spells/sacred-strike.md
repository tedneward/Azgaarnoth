- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure a whip-like
flexible line of force
that emanates from
your hand and
crackles with purple-
hued sparks. You are
considered proficient
with the weapon,
wielding it like a
normal melee
weapon, and you may
substitute your
spellcasting ability
modifier for your Strength modifier when making
attack and damage rolls with it. It has a reach of 10
feet.
Any living creature struck by the weapon suffers
excruciating pain and takes an amount of necrotic
damage equal to 4d4 + your spellcasting ability
modifier. A creature struck by the whip must make
a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it suffers
disadvantage on the next attack roll, ability check,
or saving throw it makes before the end of its next
turn. After dealing damage, the caster regains a
number of hit points equal to half the necrotic
damage dealt.
An undead creature struck by the weapon takes
damage normally, but does not suffer any further
effects. In addition, rather than being healed, when
you damage an undead creature with this spell, you
take damage equal to half the necrotic damage
inflicted.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the amount of
necrotic damage increases by 1d4 for every two slot
levels above 4th.
