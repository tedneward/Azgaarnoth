You form a ﬂoating, spinning disc of ﬂames that you then aim and shoot in a straight path towards a point you can see. Every creature in the path, a 60-foot long, 5-foot wide line, must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or none on a successful save.

At the end of the disc’s ﬂight path, the disc explodes in a 5-foot radius. Every creature in the explosion’s area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save. The explosion’s fire spreads around corners, and ignites ﬂammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

If the disc is blocked by an obstruction, the disc explodes at the point of impact in a 5-foot radius. Every creature in the explosion’s area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save. The explosion’s fire spreads around corners, and ignites ﬂammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both the line damage and explosion damage each increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
