*1st-level conjuration* (Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal lens)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure a 6-inch-diameter ball of glowing, 
crackling light that hovers at a point you choose 
within range. The orb sheds bright light in a 10-foot 
radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. As a 
bonus action on each of your turns you can move 
the orb up to 30 feet, though it winks out and the 
spell ends if it moves outside the spell's range.
For the duration, whenever you cast a spell that 
deals lightning damage, you can choose to use the 
orb as the point of origin for the spell.
