You pull the energies of the moon, channeling it into your fist, igniting it with blue cosmic fire, as you deal a damaging blow to your enemies. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is undead, or if the spell is cast under a night sky. On a successful hit, the target takes 2d8 radiant damage, and it must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone on a failed save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every slot level above 3rd.
