You conjure a 60 foot cube of sloshing murky water centered on a point that you can see within range. The water does not leave the confines of the cubic area, nor is it affected by gravity. The water is heavily obscured for everyone except you. To you, it only appears lightly obscured You can breathe and speak in this conjured water, and you have a swim speed equal to your walking speed while you are within it. 

The cube of water appears instantly, and creatures whose space is inside the edge of the area can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, they are trapped inside the area. On a successful saving throw, a creature can use its reaction to move up to its speed to an unoccupied space that is outside the area. 

Once the spell has been cast, the water tension on each side of the cube makes it tough to escape. Any creature that attempts to move out of the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it is unable to leave the area this turn. 

When the spell ends, you choose to have the water either vanish or remain. If it remains, the water loses its magic, and collapses in a wave. Each creature in a 40-foot radius on the ground under the cube must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 6d6 nonmagical bludgeoning damage, is pushed 20 feet away from the center of the effect, and is knocked prone. This wave of water also pushes and damages objects that aren't being held or carried.
