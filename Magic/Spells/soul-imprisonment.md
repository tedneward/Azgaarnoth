This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and merges it with your own. A possessed soul remains merged with your own until the spell ends or until you release, which ends the spell. While you possess a soul, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a possess soul up to ten times. Once you exploit a soul for the tenth time, you have the option to release it or destroy it, and the spell ends. While a soul is possessed, the dead humanoid it came from canâ€™t be revived.

You are able to use an action on your turn to invoke one of the following properties, which lasts for 24 hours. You can only have one property active at a time. If you invoke a new property while one is active, the active one ends and is replaced by the new one.

* ***Assimilate.*** You gain one of the creature's traits (your choice).
* ***Bolster.*** You gain the creature's damage immunities and damage resistances, if it had any.
* ***Cognizance.*** If the creature had blind sense, tremor sense or true sight you gain that ability.
* ***Pathfinding.*** You gain the creature's movement speed, which is added to your own. If the target could fly, swim, climb, or burrow you gain the ability to do so as well.
