---
You spend a short rest (during which you cannot participate in any other activities or recover hit dice) performing a ritual on an object that weighs 10 lbs or less, placing it in a small pocket dimension. Once you do so, you can use a bonus action to retrieve or stow directly to or from your hand. If the object is a weapon, you can stow or draw it as part of your free item interaction instead. 

The spell ends if you are reduced to 0 hit points or cast this spell again. If the spell ends with the object in the pocket dimension it falls to the ground next to you.
