#### Sign of Warning
*1st-level enchantment* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dried tea leaves)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You burn prophetic herbs, and the billowing smoke
grants visions of future danger, giving one creature
you touch preternatural foresight in battle. The next
time the creature makes a Dexterity check for
initiative before the spell ends, it treats any roll of 9
or lower on the d20 as a 10. In addition, for the
duration, when the target fails a Wisdom check, if
that failure would cause it to be surprised, it can
reroll that ability check. It must use the second roll.
The spell ends early on a target whenever that
creature makes an ability check for initiative.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can touch and
affect one extra creature for every two spell levels
above 1st.
