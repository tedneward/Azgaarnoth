This spell is a minor magical trick that pyromancers use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

* You create a tiny flame in your hand for up to 1 hour, shedding light as a candle and capable of lighting a lantern, torch, or other easily flammable material.
* You warm up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
* You grant a creature advantage on saving throws against cold weather for 1 hour.
* You instantaneously snuff out a flame no larger than a small campfire.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
