*2nd-level transmutation* (Cleric,Druid,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (several sticks)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You turn a hand full of sticks into 1d4 + 1
constrictor snakes  (your DM has their statistics).
The snakes you create with this spell are friendly to
you and your companions. They obey any verbal
commands that you issue to them (no action
required by you). If you don't issue any commands
to them, they defend themselves from hostile
creatures, but otherwise take no actions. Once the
spell ends, the snakes turn back into sticks.
If another creature is holding sticks that you wish
to transform, if that creature does not wish the
sticks to be affected by this spell, you must make a
melee spell attack as part of the action of casting
this spell. If the attack misses, the spell fails.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level, you transmute the sticks
into giant constrictor snakes . If you cast the spell
using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you
transmute one extra stick into a giant constrictor
snake for every two slot levels above 4th.
