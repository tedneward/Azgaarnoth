#### Azure Flame
*5th-level evocation* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of azurite)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Choose a point you can see within range. Every
creature or object in a 20-foot radius sphere
centered on the point you selected bursts into azure
colored flames. Creatures caught in the sphere's
area must make a Dexterity saving throw or take
3d8 fire damage and catch on fire. A successful save
halves the damage and avoids catching on fire.
Unattended objects take the full damage and catch
on fire.
A creature or object that starts its turn on fire
takes 1d8 fire damage. The flames can be snuffed
out with an action, ending the spell for the affected
creature. However, if an affected creature is a fiend,
only a dispel magic, remove curse, or greater
restoration will end the flames, which burn for the
spell's full duration and deal radiant instead of fire
damage.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the initial fire
damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
5th. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th
level or higher, the ongoing fire damage increases
by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 5th.
