create a burst of concussive force that disorients
victims without causing
permanent harm. Each
creature in a 20-foot
radius sphere centered
on a point you choose
within range must
make a
Constitution
saving throw. A
target takes
7d6 force
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points,
you can choose to knock the creature unconscious
instead of killing it. This choice must be made as
damage is assigned if the creature drops to 0 hit
points. A creature knocked unconscious by the spell
is stabilized at 0 hit points, as if by the spare the
dying cantrip.
Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
