You and any ally within range are drug into the earth and deposited in a chamber just big enough to hold all you. You and the allies you bring with you can breathe and the ceiling of the chamber glows softly. Divination spells of 3rd level or lower cannot detect the chamber. Any divination spell cast from inside the chamber automatically fails. When the spell ends you return to the space you occupied when you cast the spell.
