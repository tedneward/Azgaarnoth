# Tethered Mind
*5th-level evocation* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see within range. On a hit, the creature takes 6d6 psychic damage and is considered tethered. While tethered, you always know the location of the creature (if they are on the same plane of existence as you), and your melee weapon attacks against the target creature are made with advantage. If you move in a straight line toward a tethered creature, your movement speed increases by 10 feet and you are unaffected by difficult terrain. As a bonus action on your turn, you can deal an additional 1d6 psychic damage to the tethered creature.

A tethered creature can make an Intelligence saving throw at the start of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.
