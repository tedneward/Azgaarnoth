You transfer magical stores of energy from one creature to yourself or vice versa. This spell can only be used on a creature within one size category of you and only with spell slots from the Spellcasting feature.

When you cast this spell on a willing creature, you can either grant the target one of your spell slots (up to the highest spell slot level usable by the target), or take one of the targetâ€™s spell slots (up to the highest spell slot level that you can use).

When you cast this spell on an unwilling creature, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, you take one remaining spell slot from the creature at the highest spell level that it can use, or the highest spell level that you can use, whichever is lower. The spell slot granted using this spell remains usable until the recipient takes a long rest or until 24 hours have passed, whichever comes first.
