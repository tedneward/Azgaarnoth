Choose one target within range. That target must
make a Wisdom saving throw. If they fail your
target is paralyzed for the duration of the spell.
While the target is paralyzed, you may use a bonus
action to ask the target a yes or no question. The
target must answer truthfully to the best of its
ability. You may ask one question per round. The
target may repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the
end of their turn to end the spell. The spell ends
automatically if the target takes any damage.
