With a guttural roar, you unleash a wave of thunderous power in every direction around you. Every creature within a 30-foot radius of you must make a Strength save. On a failure, a creature takes 8d8 thunder damage, and falls prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half this damage and isn't knocked prone.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the thunder damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
