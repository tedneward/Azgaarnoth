You release a burst of electric energy that fills the 
area, spreading around corners. Each creature 
besides you in the area must make a Constitution 
saving throw, taking 2d12 lightning damage on a 
failed save or half as much damage on a successful 
one.

Additionally, each active spell or magical effect in 
the area whose spell level is no more than half the 
level of the slot used to cast this spell is 
automatically dispelled. For each other spell or 
magical effect in the area, make an ability check 
using your spellcasting ability. The DC of this check 
equals 10 plus the spell's level. On a success, the spell
ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d12 for each slot level above 4th.
