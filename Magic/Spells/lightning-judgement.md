A brightly glowing image of two rotating circles of glyphs appears, then a barrage of lightning bolts is exchanged from one circle to the other. Every creature within a 30-foot long, 30-foot radius cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 12d10 lightning damage on a failed save, and takes half damage on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell with a slot of 8th level or higher, you increase the damage by 1d10 for each slot level higher than 7th.
