You summon a column of soft rain, mist, and electrified air in a 60-foot-tall cylinder with a 30-foot radius centeÂ­red on a point you choose within range that lasts until the spell ends. The area is lightly obscured.

Until the spell ends, on each of your turns, you can use an action to strengthen the spell with your magic. If you do, the radius of the area grows by 10 feet for the duration. This cannot extend the radius beyond 60 feet. 

At the end of each of your turns while the spell lasts, lightning pulses, and each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 3d8 lightning damage, or 6d8 lightning damage if you cast the spell this turn or you used your action to strengthen it this turn. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half damage. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the max radius for the area increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 7th.
