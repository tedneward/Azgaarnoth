Four 10-foot radius circles of glowing glyphs appear on solid surfaces you can see within range. You can not overlap the circles. Flames erupt from the center of each circle in a 10-foot radius, 50-foot long cylinder. Every creature within the affected areas must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 20d8 fire damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage. If the cylinders overlap, their damages do not stack with each other.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell with a slot of 9th level, you increase the number of cylinders to six.
