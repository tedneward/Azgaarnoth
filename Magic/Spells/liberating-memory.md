#### Liberating Memory
*1st-level abjuration* (Artificer,Bard,Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you would be afflicted with one of the conditions listed in this spell description
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You call to mind a long-forgotten memory that
helps you resist a condition that would dominate or
impede you. This memory may even come from
some kind of previous incarnation rather than your
current lifetime. You spend a Hit Die, but do not
regain any hit points. Instead, you prevent yourself
from suffering one of following conditions that
would otherwise afflict you: blinded, deafened,
paralyzed, poisoned, or restrained.
Once you cast this spell, until the end of your
next turn, your speed is halved and you cannot take
reactions. You must have at least one Hit Die when
you cast this spell, otherwise, the spell fails.
