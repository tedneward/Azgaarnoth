---
You silently weave a simple magic to aid in theatrical productions or tricks of misdirection and subtlety. You create one of the following magical effects within range: 

* You conjure illusory words or images in a 5 foot cube that you can see within range, lasting for 10 minutes. This illusion is invisible, but you can still see it as if it were not. You can touch up to two willing creatures as part of casting the spelL allowing those creatures to see the illusion as well.
* You create an invisible area of magic that fills a 10 foot radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range, lasting 10 minutes. Creatures within 300 feet of the area can hear any sounds generated within the area as loudly and clearly as if they were only 5 feet away from the area. 
* You create magical music that emanates from you for 10 minutes. The music must be continuous and non-lyrical; you can't replicate the sounds of voices or nature. You can control the music at-will while the spell lasts, but you cannot create music using this spell that is better than what you can create using your mind or using instruments, and you can't create music that is louder than you can shout. The music stays centered on you if you move. 
* Choose one creature or object within range. If you cannot see the target, you must instead touch it as part of casting the spell If the target is or is held by an unwilling creature, it can make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid your touch, causing the spell to fail on a successful save. The target's space is filled with your choice of bright or dim light for 10 minutes, as if by an overhead spotlight. The light moves with the target, remaining in its space at all times. 
* You conjure an illusion that stays upon your person. 

For 10 minutes, you look and sound as if you are not breathing, even if you are. This doesn't affect other senses, such as touch or smell.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
