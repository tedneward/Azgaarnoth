You create a link between yourself and another willing creature. At any point during the spell, you can use your bonus action to end the spell and summon the creature to a location adjacent to you, so long as you are both on the same plane of existence. If the spell ends without you using your bonus action to trigger it, the bond is broken and the creature cannot be conjured to your location.
