- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a chunk from a century-old headstone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
With a roar of light and sound, you blast a foe's soul with magical power, pressing it against the boundaries of its fleshy constraints. Choose one creature that you can see within
range. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 10d8 necrotic damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage and is not stunned.

In addition, bright soul-light shines out in rays from the target's body, washing over nearby foes. Each creature of your choice other than the target that is within 60 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn. On a successful saving throw a creature takes half damage and nothing else. 

When this spell targets an incorporeal undead, such as a ghost or wraith, or a soul that is removed from its body, the spell ignores resistance or immunity to necrotic damage and the target has disadvantage on the Charisma saving throw.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level the necrotic damage and radiant damage dealt increases by 2d8.
