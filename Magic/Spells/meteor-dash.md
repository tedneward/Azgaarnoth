*5th-level evocation* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You wreathe yourself in fire and launch yourself 
like a meteor, flying in a direction of your choice.
If you would strike a creature, that creature can 
make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, 
your trajectory continues past the creature without 
striking them, but they take 2d6 fire damage from 
the near miss. On a failed save, you strike that 
creature.

You continue flying in a straight line until you 
strike a creature, collide with a solid surface, or fly a 
distance of 120 feet. Minor barriers, such as simple 
wooden doors or common fruit carts, are destroyed 
without interrupting your flight path.

If you strike a creature or a solid surface, the 
creature or object takes 8d6 fire damage and 4d6 
bludgeoning damage, and the creature is knocked 
prone if it is Large or smaller. Other creatures within
10 feet of the point of impact (besides yourself) must
make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 fire 
damage on a failed save, or half as much fire damage
on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage 
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
