___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of dried seaweed)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You stretch out your hand and a long strand of wet
kelp streaks out to envelop your foe and bring the
creature to your grasp. Make a ranged spell attack
against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d10
bludgeoning damage, and you can pull it up to 30
feet closer to you. If the target ends this movement
within 5 feet of you, the target is grappled by you,
just as if you had made a successful grapple attack
against it.
A creature you grapple with this spell can use its
action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a
Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check
against your spellcasting DC.
When you move, you can drag or carry the
grappled creature at half your speed. You can move
at your full speed if the creature is at least two sizes
smaller than you.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the bludgeoning
damage increases by ld10 for each slot level above
2nd.
