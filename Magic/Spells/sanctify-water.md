---
You invoke a holy or unholy blessing upon a 30-foot cube area within range. Until the spell ends, all water within the area is sanctified. Choose up to two of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. When a creature of one of the chosen types starts its turn within the sanctified water or enters it for the first time on a turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 3d6 radiant damage and has disadvantage on any attack rolls it makes before the start of its next turn. On a success, it takes half damage and suffers no other effects.

When sanctified water is transformed into Holy Water, the ritual to do so only takes 1 minute. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or 5th level the duration increases to 8 hours.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or highÂ­er, the duration increases to 7 days, and if you cast the spell with this duration on the same spot once every 7 days for a year, the spell becomes permanent.
