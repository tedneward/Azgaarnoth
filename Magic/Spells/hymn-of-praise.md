You sing an inspirational tune that bolsters your
allies' spellcasting abilities. For the duration, when
an ally within 30 feet of you casts a spell, if the spell
requires an attack roll, the ally gains a +1 bonus to
that attack roll. If an ally casts a spell within 30 feet
of you that requires one or more creatures to roll a
saving throw during the same turn as the spell is
cast, the DC of those saving throws is increased by 1.
Until the spell ends, if an ally within 30 feet of
you uses a Channel Divinity feature that requires an
attack roll or saving throw, it gains the same
bonuses for that use of Channel Divinity that this
spell would grant for casting a spell. At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you gain an
additional +1 bonus to the spell's saving throw DC
or attack roll for every two slot levels above 3rd.
