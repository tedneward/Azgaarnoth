#### Conjure Plants
*3rd-level conjuration* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You summon plant creatures that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears; four [awakened shrubs](../../Creatures/Awakened.md#awakened-shrub) or one [awakened tree](../../Creatures/Awakened.md#awakened-tree).

Each plant creature disappears when it drops to zero hit points, or when the spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you donâ€™t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with a 8th level slot.
