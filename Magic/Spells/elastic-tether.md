# Elastic Tether
*2nd-level conjuration* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute (see description)

You touch an object, person, or space, and whisper the words of tethering. For 1 minute, the target acts as an anchor to which you can return. For the duration, as a bonus action, you can instantly teleport yourself to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. The spell ends immediately after teleporting in this way, or if you are ever more than 120 feet from the target.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the range you can be from the target increases by 120 feet, and the duration of the spell increases by 1 minute, for each slot level above the 2nd.
