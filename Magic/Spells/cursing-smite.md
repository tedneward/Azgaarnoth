---
The first time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon sings an eerie dirge and the attack deals 1d12 extra necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become cursed until the spell ends. 

A cursed creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, and whenever it makes an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw that isn't against this spell, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the result. It repeats the Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success. 

While a creature is cursed by this spelL it suffers no effects from the [bane](bane.md) spell.
