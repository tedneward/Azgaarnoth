# Lifetap
*2nd-level necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: S, M (two identical needles)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You launch magical darts at two creatures within range, one an ally and one an adversary, with the darts transferring life force from your foe to your ally in a golden flash. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range. On a hit, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 2d10 plus your Spellcasting modifier, and a conscious ally of your choice within range gains temporary hit points equal to the damage inflicted.

If the attack misses, a conscious ally of your choice within range gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum 1).

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
