spell, and by using an action on each of your turns,
you can make a melee spell attack against a creature
within your reach. On a hit, the creature takes cold
damage equal to 1d10 + your spellcasting ability

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the cold damage
increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 2nd.
