#### Eyes of the Mage
*7th-level divination* (Bard,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
Your eyes take on an otherworldly sheen as you
magically see through deception and obscurement,
and even gain a glimpse of future events. For the
duration, you have advantage on all Wisdom
checks, your ranged attacks ignore half cover and
three-quarters cover, and when you make an attack
roll at disadvantage due to concealment, you gain a
+5 bonus on that attack roll. Until the spell ends,
you can also see invisible creatures and objects as if
they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal
Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly
and translucent.
Once before the spell ends, when a creature you
can see makes a successful attack roll that would hit
one of your allies, you can use your reaction to force
that creature to reroll the attack roll with
disadvantage. It must use the lower of the two
attack rolls. Once you use your reaction for this
effect, the spell ends immediately.
