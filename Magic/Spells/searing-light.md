___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A blast of light shoots from your palm. Make a
ranged spell attack against a target within range. If
you hit, the target takes 4d10 radiant damage. If the
target is undead, it takes maximum damage, and
must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, the target is stunned until the end of its next
turn.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radiant
damage increases by 1d10 (or max damage against
undead) for every slot level above 3rd.
