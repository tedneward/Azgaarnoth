A bright streak ﬂashes from your pointed finger to a point you chose within range, and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of blinding radiance. Every creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage. The light lingers brieﬂy, shedding bright from the sphere’s center in a radius of 40 feet, and dim light for an additional 40 feet until the start of your next turn. This is treated as magical light. If any of this spell’s area overlaps with darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
