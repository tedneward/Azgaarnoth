You touch a weapon and cause it to erupt with blazing hot fire when it is drawn. For the duration, the weapon emits bright light for 20 feet and dim light for another 20 feet while it is being held, it is magical if it was not already, and attacks made with the weapon deal bonus fire damage on a hit equal to 3d8 + your Spellcasting modifier.

When the weapon is used to score a critical hit or hit with an opportunity attack, if the attack's target is flammable or is a creature, it is lit [ablaze](../../Conditions/Ablaze.md). It instantly takes 1d10 fire damage, and until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, it takes 1d10 fire damage again at the start of each of its turns.
