After setting the sculpture used for this spell down on the ground as part of this spellâ€™s casting, you move no more than 300 feet away from it and finish casting the spell. A 100-foot radius, 3,000-foot high pillar of light shoots upwards, centered on the sculpture. Every creature in the cylinder must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the start of your next turn. If a creature enters or starts its turn in the cylinder, it must make the same Constitution saving throw. The pillar sheds bright light in a 120-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 120 feet. Moving the sculpture more than 30 feet will cause the spell to end.
