#### Snowball
*2nd-level conjuration* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a small ball of cotton)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure a two-inch wide ball of ice and snow in your hand, which you can launch at your foes as a bonus action. When you do so, choose a point you can see within range. The snowball streaks toward that point, then detonates in a frigid blast with a 5-foot radius. Each creature within the blast must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save.

If you choose not to launch the snowball immediately, you can spend your action on future turns to increase the spell's power. For each action spent empowering the snowball, the size of the damage dice improves by one step. The damage dice cannot improve beyond d12s. Similarly, each action spent empowering the snowball increases the radius of the blast by 5 feet, up to a maximum radius of 25 feet.

If the spell ends before you launch the snowball, it detonates at its current power level. If the snowball cannot reach the target point (for example, if you targeted a point on the other side of a pane of glass) then it detonates upon striking a barrier.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by one die for each slot level above 2nd.
