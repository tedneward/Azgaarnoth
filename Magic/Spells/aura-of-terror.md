An aura of fear emanates from you in a 30-foot radius and moves with you for the spell's duration. Each creature that enters the aura for the first time, or starts its turn there, must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for the duration.

A creature frightened by this spell can try another saving throw if it ends its turn where it can no longer see you. On a successful save, the creature is no longer frightened.
