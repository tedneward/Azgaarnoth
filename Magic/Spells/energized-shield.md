___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You touch a shield and transform it into an
elemental energy type of your choice (cold, fire,
lightning, or acid). You can safely wield the shield,
and while it is donned, you gain resistance to
damage from the shield's type for the spell's
duration.
In addition, when you take the Attack action, you
can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the shield. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + your
spellcasting ability modifier of damage of the
shield's elemental type.
The shield returns to normal when the duration
expires. Only you can wield the shield safely.
Another creature that touches the shield takes the
damage as described above.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the elemental
damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels
above 2nd.
