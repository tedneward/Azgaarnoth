#### Azuth's Exalted Triad
*5th-level transmutation* (Cleric,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
If you do not have any spells prepared (via the Spellcasting feature of a class that prepares spells, such as wizard, paladin, druid, or cleric), this spell has no effect. When you cast this spell, choose any spell of 1st or 2nd level that you have prepared. Once the spell is chosen, that selection can't be changed until the duration ends.

Until this spell ends, the first time you cast the chosen spell by expending a spell slot as usual, you gain the ability to cast that same chosen spell two more times before the spell ends without expending a spell slot. This ability to cast the chosen spell without using spell slots is immediately lost when duration of this casting of Azuth's exalted triad ends, even if that ability has not been used.
