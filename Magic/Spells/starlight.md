---
You call eerie starlight down upon one creature you can see within range. The target's space is filled with dim light until the end of your next turn, and it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by the spell a creature is incapacitated and it can't move or speak. The target repeats the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success. The spell also ends if the target takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to touch the target and shake it out of its stupor. The target has disadvantage on the first saving throw if it can see the sky and it is night. If the target is blinded or can't see, it automatically succeeds on any saving throw for the spell 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the target doesn't repeat the saving throw on its turns. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes.
