___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** Touch 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round 
---
You shroud yourself or a creature that you touch in a magical ward that has 1d6 hit points and lasts until the end of your next turn. If the target would take damage before the spell ends, the ward blocks that damage and takes the damage instead. The ward can't block psychic or poison damage unless it is dealt by an attack. If the ward is reduced to 0 hit points, the target takes any remaining damage and the spell ends.

If you target yourself with this spelL it doesn't require concentration. 

The ward's hit points increase by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6) and 17th level (4d6).
