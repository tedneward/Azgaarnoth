*1st-level transmutation* (Bard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
This spell greatly increases the volume of all sound in a 15-foot radius sphere centered on a creature or object of your choice within range. If an unwilling creature is targeted by this spell, it must make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, the spell successfully targets the creature. If the save is successful, the spell fails.

Once the spell takes effect, a creature outside of the spell's area listening to sounds coming from within the area has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to discern sounds within the area. This amplifying effect isn't noticeable by creatures within the affected area. The spell has no effect when targeting a creature or object in an area affected by the  silence spell or another effect that quiets all sound.
