# Disarm
*evocation cantrip* (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

As an action, choose a creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature must make a Strength saving throw with advantage or drop an object or weapon they are holding in their hand. This spell has no effect if they are holding the object with two hands.

If they are holding two items (one in each hand), select which item they drop. If they fail the saving throw by a score of 5 or greater, the item flies out of their hand in a direction of your choosing, up to 10 feet away from their original location.
