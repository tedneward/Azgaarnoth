You direct invisible, repulsive force to push a creature or unattended object you can see. If you target a creature, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 20 feet in a direction of your choice. On a successful save, the creature is pushed 10 feet.The amount of forced movement is halved for Huge creatures, and Gargantuan creatures are not pushed by this spell.If the creature’s or object’s forced movement is interrupted by impact with an obstruction such as a wall, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it still had yet to be pushed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you increase the number of targets by one for each slot level higher than 2nd.
