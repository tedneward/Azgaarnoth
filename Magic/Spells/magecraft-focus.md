Choose one type of tool with which you are
proficient. Until the spell ends or the next time you
finish a short or long rest (whichever comes first),
whenever you make an ability check with the
chosen type of tool to craft or repair an item, you
have advantage on the roll. This spell ends early if
you roll initiative. Once you cast this spell, you gain
no benefit from subsequent castings until after the
next time you finish a long rest.
