You point at one creature of Large size or smaller
that you can see within range. The creature must
make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d10
slashing damage, as it begins to rip apart. On a
successful save, the target takes half the damage.
On each of your turns for the duration, you can use
a bonus action to force the creature to make the
save and suffer the damage again.
If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this
spell, it dies as it is ripped in half.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 5th.
