With a snap of your fingers you banish heat from a target. There are two possible uses for the spell: targeting either one creature that you can see within range or targeting an area of liquid, such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava. 

If you target a creature, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 5d10 cold damage and until the end of your next turn, its speed is reduced to 0 feet and it has disadvantage on weapon attack rolls. It also gains one level of exhaustion unless it has resistance or immunity to the spell's damage. On a success, it only takes half damage and it doesn't suffer any other effects. 

If you target an area, your magic affects a portion of liquid that you can see within range and fits into a 30 foot cube. The affected liquid is frozen solid for 10 minutes, provided that there are no creatures in the area. Not all liquids lose their properties when frozen. For example, frozen lava may still be extremely hot to the touch, and frozen acid may still sting or even cause damage in extreme concentrations. Any levels of exhaustion caused by this spell are removed from a creature when it finishes a short or long rest in a warm environment. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
