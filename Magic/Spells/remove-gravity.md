# Remove Gravity
*3rd-level transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (two magnets)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You target one creature you can see within range. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or begin fl oating 1 foot off the ground. The targetâ€™s speed is reduced to 5 feet and it has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws, as well as on attack rolls, as they spin uncontrollably in the air. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target gains a fl ying speed, the effect automatically ends.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 3rd.
