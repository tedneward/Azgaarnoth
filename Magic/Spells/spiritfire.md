You create a ﬂame in your hand out of interplanar energy, that does not ignite creatures and objects, but can trigger the sensation of burning against those hostile towards you. You can use an action to toss the ﬂame as a ranged spell attack against a creature within range or thrust it as a melee spell attack, dealing 4d6 psychic damage on a hit. The ﬂame dissipates afterwards, but you can have it reappear in your hand as a bonus action. If the target is not hostile towards you, they do not take any damage from the ﬂame.

The ﬂame emits bright light in a 20-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead take an additional 2d6 psychic damage on a hit, and the ﬂame will change color brieﬂy upon hitting such creatures before dissipating, differently colored by type.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you increase the damage by 1d6 for each slot level higher than 2nd.
