A glowing mote of energy rises and hovers over your shoulder, and it sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. The first time that a spell that targets you either forces you to make a saving throw or targets you with a spell attack, roll 1d4 + 5. If the number rolled equals or exceeds the level of the spell, that spell fails to affect you, and is turned back upon its caster. If that spell required a saving throw, its caster is now the one who must make the saving throw against your spellcasting DC; if it was targeting you with a spell attack, the caster is now the target of that spell attack using your spell attack bonus.

For the spell's duration, each additional time a spell that targets you either forces you to make a saving throw or targets you with a spell attack, repeat the process as above but subtract the level of any spells previously turned from the result's total. If the total still equals or exceeds the level of the spell, it is turned back on its caster as described above. If the total is greater than 1 but less than the level of the spell targeting you, then the holy star remains, and you are affected by the targeting spell as normal. However, if the total is reduced to 0 or below, you are affected by the targeting spell as normal and this spell immediately ends.

While the holy star remains, you can use your action on each of your turns to launch a fire bolt (as the cantrip) from the star at a target you can see within 120 feet. The fire bolt uses your spell attack bonus, and deals 3d10 fire damage on a hit.
