#### Mirror Army
*7th-level illusion* (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** Self (20 feet) 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 
---
You weave an army of illusory duplicates, which mirror the appearance and actions of you and each creature of your choice that you can see within 20 feet of you. Until the spell ends, each mirrored creature in the area has advantage on attack rolls, and attack rolls made against any of those creatures suffer disadvantage. 

In addition, whenever a mirrored creature is targeted by a spell, if the caster is a creature, it must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or the spell has no effect on the target, affecting an illusory duplicate instead.

A mirrored creature can attempt to hide even when it can be seen, by blending into the crowd. It must use a Charisma (Deception) or (Performance) check instead of a Dexterity (Stealth) check, and it can be detected by either a Wisdom (Insight) or (Perception) check, as well as by the passive versions of both skills. 

Creatures that don't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or that can see through illusions, as with truesight, can choose to ignore the negative effects of the spell.
