A burst of black force erupts in a 10-foot radius sphere centered at a point you can see within range. Creatures caught within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

For the duration, the area of the sphere remains encased in a barried of black force. A creature cannot move out of the sphere's area unless it uses its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature can move out of the sphere, though when it does its speed is reduced by half until the end of the turn. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 force damage and is unable to move out of the area.

The sphere is opaque and substantial, and it cannot be seen into from outide. Creatures within the sphere have total cover against attacks made from outside of it, and vice-versa.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the force damage from the initial burst increases by 1d6 for every slot level above 4th.
