You cause a glowing white blade of
force to spring from your hand. The
blade can take the form of any bladed
weapon you are proficient with. You
can attack with the blade using your
spellcasting ability modifier instead of
the normal ability modifier used for the
attack. If you score a hit with the blade
against a living creature, it takes 2d8 radiant damage. If you hit an undead with the
blade, it takes 3d8 radiant damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radiant
damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels
above 3rd.
