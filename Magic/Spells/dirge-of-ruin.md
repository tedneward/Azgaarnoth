- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Your magical lament stirs destructive forces that
damage and weaken your enemies. For the
duration, any creature of your choice that starts its
turn within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
2d10 thunder damage, and it has disadvantage on
Strength ability checks, attack rolls, and saving
throws until the end of its next turn. On a
successful save, the creature takes half the damage,
and doesn't have disadvantage on Strength checks.
The dirge can be heard up to 150 feet away (or
farther with a successful Wisdom (Perception)
check as determined by your DM).
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.
