You make a gesture with your hand at a nonmagical ﬂame you can see, no larger than a 5-foot cube, and it suddenly bursts, spreading to all ﬂammable objects within 20 feet. A creature within 10 feet of the original ﬂame when you cast this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, and takes half damage on a successful save.
