Your battle cry fills your allies with righteous fury, making their strikes more sure and deadly. Until the start of your next turn, the first time each turn that you or a creature friendly to you makes a melee attack, that creature gains a +2 bonus to the attack roll. If an attack that benefits from this bonus hits, the damage of the attack is increased by an amount equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
