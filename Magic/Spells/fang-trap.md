---
You create a magical trap that takes the form of massive poisonous fangs when activated. When you cast this spell, you create a magical trap tied to a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). While casting this spell, you physically trace the area of the surface or the outline of the object to be trapped. If you choose a surface, the area of the surface can be no larger than 20 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 20 feet from where you cast this spell, the spell ends without being triggered.

You decide what triggers the trap when you cast the spell. For *fang trap*s placed on a surface, most typical triggers include touching or standing on the trapped surface, removing another object covering the surface, or approaching within a certain distance of the surface area. For *fang trap*s inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or manipulating the object in a pre-described way. Once a *fang trap* is triggered, this spell ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or according to whether or not the creature has
immunity to poison damage or the poisoned condition. Unlike a [glyph of warding](./glyph-of-warding.md), it can't be made to activate on the basis of alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the *fang trap*, such as those who say a certain password. You are unable to trigger the *fang trap* yourself.

Any creature that sees you cast this spell knows the exact area affected, and immediately makes an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC, gaining advantage on that check. If the creature succeeds, it also knows what triggers the trap. Otherwise, the *fang trap*'s presence is almost undetectable and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be noticed.

When the *fang trap*  discharges, the object or surface grows huge fangs that immobilize the creature who triggered it. The creature is restrained until the beginning of its next turn. At the beginning of its next turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained. If it fails, it takes 2d8 piercing damage, 2d8 poison damage, and 2d8 psychic damage, and remains restrained for 1 minute.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
