#### Mass Death Ward
*8th-level abjuration* (Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 8 hours
---
Choose up to six creatures within 30 feet of you. For
the spell's duration, the next time a target would
drop to 0 hit points from taking damage, it drops to
1 hit point instead, and the spell ends for it.
If the spell is still in effect when a target is
subjected to an effect that would kill it
instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect
is instead negated for that target, and the spell ends
for it.
