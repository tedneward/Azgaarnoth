You drain the heat from all living creatures within 20 feet of you. Each creature in the area takes 12d6 cold damage, or half as much on a successful Constitution saving throw.

The influx of drained heat that you drain from your victims bolsters your own resilience. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 5 x the number of creatures that take damage from this spell.
