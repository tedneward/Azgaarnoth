You may only cast this on a weapon that deals
slashing or piercing damage. That weapon can warn
you a second before danger occurs. For the
duration, the weapon gains one charge, that can be
spent to allow you to reroll one saving throw. You
must accept the results of the second roll, even if it
worse.
