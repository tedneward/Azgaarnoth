#### Boulder Shot
*4th-level transmutation* (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 120 feet 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 
---
You summon a boulder from an unoccupied space adjacent to a surface within range that you can see, like a floor, walL or ceiling. The surface doesn't have to be made of a single contiguous materiaL but it must mostly be made of earth, sand, stone, metaL crystaL or another suitable earthen or stone-like materiaL and it must be at least 1 foot deep, or else the spell fails. 

When the boulder appears, you use magic to hurl it at one creature or object within 120 feet of the boulder that you can see. Make a spell attack against the target. 

On a hit, the target takes 6d10 nonmagical bludgeoning damage and must make a Strength saving throw, falling prone and being pushed 15 feet on a failed save. On a miss, the target takes half damage and is not knocked prone or pushed.

The spell attack you make with this spell determines cover and line of effect (including the direction to push) as if it was made from the location where the boulder was summoned rather than your location, and it ignores disadvantage caused by a target being prone.

This spell deals double damage to objects and structures. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
