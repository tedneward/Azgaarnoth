# Conjure Shambling Mound
*7th-level conjuration* (Druid, Shaman)

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth an [shambling mound](/Creatures/ShamblingMound.md) created from any vegetation around you. Choose an unoccupied area near a source of vegetation that you can see within range. A shambling mound will rise from the ground in this location. The mound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points. The mound is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the mound, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the mound, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. If your concentration is broken before the spell's duration is reached, you lose control of the mound and it becomes hostile toward you and your companions. A hostile shambling mound can't be dismissed by you. It disappears when its hit points reach 0 or 1 hour after you summoned it, whichever happens first.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 9thlevel spell slot, you summon two shambling mounds in unoccupied area that you can see.
