As you strike, you call out an ancient prophecy that seems to have predicted your opponent's defeat long ago. 

As part of the action of casting this spell, make a ranged weapon attack against a creature within range. You can use your spellcasting ability instead of Dexterity for the attack and damage roll for this attack. If the attack hits, it inflicts an additional 2d12 psychic damage, and all attack rolls against the target are made with advantage for the spell's duration.

At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it takes 6d12 psychic damage and is frightened of you until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the spell ends.

This spell immediately ends if you cast it again before the end of its duration.
