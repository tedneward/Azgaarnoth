The sound and vibrations within an area of your choosing become greatly amplified. This spell takes effect in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point you can see. Within the affected area, thunder damage dice are doubled, faint whispers become as audible as casual speech, and casual speech becomes as loud as screams, and screams become almost deafening. Creatures have a -10 penalty on checks made to move silently within the affected area, and a +10 bonus on checks made to hear creatures within the affected area.

If any of this spellâ€™s area overlaps with magical silence created by a spell of 4th level or lower, the spell that created the silence is dispelled.
