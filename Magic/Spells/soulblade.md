---
You create a glowing blade of magical force in your free hand, made from a small piece of your soul The blade is similar in size and shape to a longsword, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can summon the blade again as a bonus action. 

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the soul blade. On a hit, the target takes 6d6 force damage plus 3d10 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d10 necrotic damage (if you are evil) which ignores resistance. If the target is an incorporeal undead, such as a ghost, or a soul removed from its body, the attack deals maximum damage and ignores immunity. 

The attack also counts as a melee weapon attack made using a magic weapon, and you can choose to use your Strength modifier or your Dexterity modifier instead of your spellcasting modifier for the attack roll.

The blade sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. A creature killed by this spell has its soul injured, and cannot be restored to life except by a [true resurrection](./true-resurrection.md) or [wish](./wish.md) spell.

You add your spellcasting ability modifier as a bonus to saving throws to maintain concentration on this spell.

You can use a bonus action to end the spell early. If the spell ends for any other reason, you lose the fragment of your soul that was left in the blade, causing you to take 6d6 necrotic damage and gain one level of exhaustion. This damage cannot be prevented or reduced and it ignores resistance and immunity.
