#### Frigid Barrier
*3rd-level conjuration* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny sheet of glass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You create sheets of ice on one or more solid 
surfaces within range. Each sheet is a 5-foot-square 
panel that's 1 foot thick, and you can create a 
number of sheets up to your spellcasting ability 
modifier. The panels can be in any orientation as 
long as at least one edge of each panel is anchored 
to a solid surface or another panel, although a 
particularly lopsided structure may collapse.

If a panel cuts through a creature's space when it 
appears, that creature is pushed to the nearest 
unoccupied space and must make a Dexterity saving 
throw, taking 2d8 cold damage on a failed save or 
half as much damage on a successful one.

As a bonus action on each of your turns for the 
duration, you can create or dissolve any number of 
panels, as long as there are never more panels in 
place at one time than your spellcasting ability 
modifier.

These sheets of ice are objects that can be 
damaged and therefore breached. Each panel has AC 
10 and 20 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire 
damage.
