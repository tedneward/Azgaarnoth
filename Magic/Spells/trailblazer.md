Flames erupt from your back and swirl in a cyclone around your legs to propel you rapidly forward. When the spell is cast and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, you gain 60 extra feet of movement for that turn only. In addition, you gain the following benefits for the duration:

* Your jumping distance is tripled 
* You do not provoke opportunity attacks by moving. 
* You can move through other creatures' spaces, and you can move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling, but only on your turns. 
* When you move into a creature's space for the first time on one of your turns, that creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 6d6 fire damage and is knocked prone. On a success, it takes half damage and isn't knocked prone. If you end your turn in an occupied space, you fall prone in the nearest unoccupied space. 
* When you move across the ground on your turn, you leave an area of flames in your wake that lasts until the end of your next turn. The path of fire is as wide as your space and reaches 5 feet high. When another creature ends its turn within the flames, it takes 4d6 fire damage. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage dealt on your turns increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.
