You unleash powerful winds that swirl in a 60-foot long, 15-foot-diameter cylinder (one end must be adjacent to you). Every creature in the cylinder must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed Strength save, a Large or smaller creature is pushed 3d4 x 5 feet in a random direction and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful Strength save a creature is pushed 1d4 x 5 feet in a random direction and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed Dexterity save, a creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and falls prone, and takes half damage on a successful save.
