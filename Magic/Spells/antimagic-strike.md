#### Antimagic Strike
*6th-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (a melee weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
 You wreathe your weapon with antimagic energy, causing it to brieﬂy become a bane of all mages. As part of the action used to cast this spell, you make a melee weapon attack against a Large or smaller creature. On a hit, the target is unable to cast spells, all spells and magical effects currently affecting it are suppressed, and all magic items carried, wielded, or worn by the creature are rendered mundane until the end of your next turn (the durations of the suppressed spells still count the passed round). Additionally, whether you hit the target or not, you are affected by the spell’s added effect as if you were hit by the attack.

Alternatively, if used against a spell or magic item, this spell suppresses the other spell or magic item until the end of your next turn. Spells and other magical effects created by artifacts and deities are unaffected by this spell. If another spell or magical effect targets or includes within its area of effect a creature or object affected by this spell (including you), this spell’s duration immediately ends. A summoned creature hit by this spell disappears.

This spell was once devised by a bladesinger as a desperate gamble to defeat an enemy mage whose magical prowess was superior.
