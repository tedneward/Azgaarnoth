A cloud of gray shadowy goo leaps from your hand
and hits a creature of your choice that you can see
within range, ripping at the target's eyes, flowing
into its mouth, and menacing it any way it can. The
bolt of goo deals 2d6 necrotic damage to its target.
In addition, the target must make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failure, the target has
disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and
saving throws for the duration.
The target can attempt a new Constitution saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
spell on a success.
