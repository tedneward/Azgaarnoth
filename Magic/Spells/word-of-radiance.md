You utter a divine word, and burning radiance (or some other energy, as befits your god--check with your DM) erupts from you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 radiant (or other, depending on your god) damage.

The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
