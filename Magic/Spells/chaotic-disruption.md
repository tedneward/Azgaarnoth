- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You impact a creature with a bolt of unstable magical energy, causing its next use of magic to potentially go awry. Make a ranged spell attack against a Large or smaller creature you can see. On a hit, the creature takes 3d6 force damage, and the creature must make either a DC 11 spellcasting ability check or a Constitution saving throw (the target chooses) the next time that it casts a spell before the start of your next turn. If the creature fails the check or save, its spell fails, and the DM must roll on the sorcerer classâ€™ Wild Surge table.The effect that the DM rolled is activated by the targeted creature. If the DM rolls a result of 99-00, the result must be rerolled unless the creature actually has expended sorcery points. If you cast this spell in a wild magic zone, the DM makes two table rolls instead for the targeted creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage is increased by 1d6 and the check DC is increased by 1 for each slot level above 1st.
