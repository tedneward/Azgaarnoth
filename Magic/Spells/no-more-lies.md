# No More Lies
*3rd-level enchantment* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you make a Charisma (Intimidation) or Wisdom (Insight) check against a creature you can see within range

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You roll 1d10 and add the result to the triggering ability check. In addition, any creature you can see within range must make a  Constitution saving throw if it fulfills one or more of the following conditions: if it is a creature with the shapechanger tag (such as a doppelganger or lycanthrope), if it is concentrating on a transmutation or illusion spell, or if it is currently the target of a spell that has altered its form. On a failed save, the creature instantly reverts to its normal form, and if it is maintaining concentration on a spell, the spell is suppressed until the end of your next turn, at which time any suppressed spell resumes its effect, provided that its duration has not expired.
