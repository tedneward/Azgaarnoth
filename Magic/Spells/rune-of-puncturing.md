You place a magical rune on a weapon, increasing the sharpness of its point. When this weapon hits a creature, it scores a critical hit on a 19 or 20.
 
If this is your weapon, you may make a melee attack as a part of casting this spell.

***​At Higher Levels​.*** If this spell is cast with a spell slot of a higher level than 1st, it increases the critical hit range by 1 for every two slot levels after the 2nd, so at 3rd-level the range is 18-20, at 5th-level 17-20, at 7th level 16-20, and at 9th level a critical hit occurs on a 15-20.
