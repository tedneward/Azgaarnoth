---
The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, a bolt of flaming lightning streaks down from above and strikes the target at the same moment. The attack deals an extra 2d8 lightning damage and 3d6 fire damage to the target, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. It has disadvantage on the saving throw if it is wearing armor made of metal.

On a failed saving throw, the target is knocked prone, can't take reactions until the start of your next turn, and is lit [ablaze](../Conditions/Ablaze.md). This fire continues even after the spell ends.

If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you hit with the attack, the lightning damage increases by 1d8. If the target is already ablaze when you hit with the attack, the fire damage increases by 2d6. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the lightning damage dealt increases by 1d8 (or 2d8 in stormy conditions) and the fire damage dealt increases by 1d6 (or 2d6 if the target is already [ablaze](../Conditions/Ablaze.md)) for each slot level above 5th.
