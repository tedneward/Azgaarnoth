Once you cast this spell, you hold its energy to
empower another spell you will cast later. Once
before the spell ends, you can either grant yourself
advantage on one spell attack roll or impose
disadvantage on one saving throw made by a target
against a spell you cast.
In addition, if the spell which you enhanced with
one of the effects described above deals damage,
you can reroll any damage die that rolls a 1. You
must use the second roll for each die, even if the
damage is lower.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, when rerolling
damage dice for a spell you enhanced, you can reroll
any damage die that rolls a 1 or a 2.
