You ignite a powerful storm of life energy within the soul of one creature that you can see within range. While the spell lasts, at the end of each of your turns while you are within range of the target, you restore hit points to the target equal to half of its maximum hit points and restore 4d8 hit points to up to six other creatures of your choice within 30 feet of the target.

In addition, until the spell ends, the target does not lose consciousness or become incapacitated for reaching 0 hit points. This does not prevent death.
