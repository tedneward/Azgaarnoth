- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You momentarily exist in multiple places, just long enough to attack everyone around you.

Select a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus that you can see within 30 feet; then, select an unoccupied space beside each creature you selected. You appear in all those spaces simultaneously and make a single melee attack against each creature, using an attack roll as if you had rolled a 15 on the d20, adding your casting modifier to the attack and damage rolls.

You can then choose one of those spaces, or your starting space, and only exist in that place. 

Any effect that would apply to you, such as if you appeared in a cloud of daggers or hit someone with flame shield, does not take effect until you return to a single spot.

***At Higher Levelâ€‹s.*** Increase the range of your strike by 10 feet for each level spell slot above 3rd.
