A glowing barrier of radiance appears to protect you. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +5 bonus to AC and have resistance to fi re, radiant, lightning, and force damage. Your body shines brightly, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Any creature within 30 feet of you when the spell is cast must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. A creature can avoid this effect by using their reaction to drop whatever is in their hands and covering their eyes.
