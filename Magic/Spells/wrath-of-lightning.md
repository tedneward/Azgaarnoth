The image of a hovering, rotating 15-foot-radius sphere of light orbited by several rings of glowing glyphs appears in an unoccupied space, centered on a point within range. The sphere emanates countless tendrils of lightning in all directions and unleashes a dozen spiraling bolts of lightning in a shocking torrent. A 10-foot-radius, 150-foot-long cylinder of lightning is projected in a direction of your choice from any point on the outer border of the sphere (the center of one face of the cylinder is connected to a point on the surface of the sphere). If a creature is within the cylinder, or within 10 feet of the sphere, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 40d6 lightning damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn on a failed save, and takes half damage on a successful save.The spell damages objects in the area and ignites ﬂammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.
