#### Read Object
*6th-level divination* *(ritual)* (Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch (1 object)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You can concentrate on an object you are touching,
reading psychic impressions left on it by recent
events. At the end of the time you spend casting
this spell, you learn of any events within the past 24
hours that occurred within 30 feet of the object. You
see, hear, and smell those events from the object's
point of view, as if you had been there at the time.
You also see a mental image of the last creature
that handled the object, also from the object's
perspective, no matter how long ago the object was
last held. The only information you receive about
the creature is its appearance at that time
(including a sense of its size), whether it was alone
(although you can't see any other creatures that
might have been there), and a one or two-word
description from the DM describing that creature's
emotional state the last time it touched the object
creature was not capable of emotion, or if its mental
state was too alien for you to understand, the DM
will tell you that instead.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, if the object has
been handled by multiple creatures within the last
week, you get the same information about each
creature who handled it during that time the same
way you would normally receive about the last
creature who handled it.
