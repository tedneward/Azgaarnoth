#### Animal Spy
*2nd-level divination* (Druid,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You can borrow some of the senses of a beast you
touch. During each of your turns you can use a
bonus action to see what the beast sees and hear
what it hears until the start of your next turn,
gaining the benefits of any special senses that beast
may possess. During this time, you are deaf and
blind with regard to your own senses. If the beast
moves more than 1 mile away from you, the spell
ends.
This spell only affects beasts with an Intelligence
score of 3 or less. It can also affect creatures that are not beasts, but which are familiars (per the find
familiar spell), provided they have an Intelligence of
3 or less. You don't gain any control over the beast
or any communication with it other than seeing and
hearing through its senses.
If you cast this spell on a creature that is tied to
another intelligent creature by a class feature or
spell (such as a wizard's familiar or a ranger's
animal companion), then the intelligent creature to
whom the target of this spell is tied can make a
Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell. If
that save succeeds, the spell fails. Whether the roll
succeeds or fails, the intelligent creature tied to the
beast gains no special awareness of this spell or its
effects.
