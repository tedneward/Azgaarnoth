*4th-level abjuration* *(ritual)* (Artificer,Bard,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of rare sands and powdered reagents worth at least 500 gp)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered
---
You create a mystical connection with a single
inanimate object you touch. When that object is
damaged, moved, or touched at any later time, you
are instantly aware of this fact. If another creature
physically touches the warded object, you receive a
mental image of the creature.
For purposes of divination spells (such as
scrying), you are considered to have first-hand
knowledge of the creature who triggered the effect
as if you had met.
This effect activates when the object is
disturbed for any reason, whether someone
touches it or pokes it with a pole, a cat
walks upon it, or an earthquake knocks it
over.
This spell ends as soon as the
effect is activated. Because
of its costly material
components, most
spellcasters
reserve
this spell to protect valuable, out-of-the-way items.
This spell is considered a magical trap. It can be
detected with an Intelligence (Arcana or
Investigation) check made against your spellcasting
DC, but it can only be dispelled magically. You can
designate a password that allows another creature
to handle the object without sounding the mental
alarm if you choose.
