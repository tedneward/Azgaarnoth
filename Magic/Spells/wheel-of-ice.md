You form a ﬂoating, spinning disc of frozen ice chunks that you then aim and shoot in a straight path towards a point you can see. Every creature in the path, a 60-foot long, 5-foot wide line, must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or none on a successful save.

At the end of the disc’s ﬂight path, the disc explodes in a 5-foot radius. Every creature in the explosion’s area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save. If the disc is blocked by an obstruction, the disc explodes at the point of impact in a 5-foot radius. Every creature in the explosion’s area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both the line damage and explosion damage each increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
