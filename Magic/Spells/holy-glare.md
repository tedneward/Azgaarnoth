With a word, you begin to glow with a circular aura of swirling light that sears and rebukes your foes. For the duration, you shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. When a creature ends its turn within 10 feet of you, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed saving throw, it takes 3d6 radiant damage and it has disadvantage on any attack rolls made against you before the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half damage and suffers no other effects. 

Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on saving throws to maintain concentration.
