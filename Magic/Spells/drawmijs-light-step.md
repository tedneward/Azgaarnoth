___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small portion of fur from a cat's paw and a duck's feather)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
---
A levitation field surrounds the feet of a creature
you touch. For the duration, the creature hovers
slightly above the ground, leaving no trace of its
passage. The creature's movement speed and
footing are unaffected by uneven ground, snow, ice,
or similar terrain. However, if the recipient takes
the Dash action, the spell ends.
In addition, an affected creature can move over
water, but rough seas or waves higher than 1-foot
above the surface disrupt the levitation field and
end the spell early.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the duration is
extended for another 10 minutes for each slot level
above 1st.
