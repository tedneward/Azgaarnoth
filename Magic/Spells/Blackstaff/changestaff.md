*7th-level transmutation* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a staff, see the description)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You transform a specially prepared staff into a
creature that is identical to a treant, except it
cannot speak or animate trees. The creature is
friendly to you and follows your commands to the
best of its abilities. If you do not issue commands, it
takes no action on its turn other than to defend
itself. It acts on your initiative, beginning its turn as
soon as yours ends. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, it
reverts to a staff and shatters. You can only have
one changestaff  spell active at a time, and you must
wait 24 hours before casting it again.
The staff used for this spell must be prepared over
the course of a lunar month. Each night you carve
intricate runes into it while muttering eldritch
invocations. At the end of the cycle, the staff is
ready for use.
