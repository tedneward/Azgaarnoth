Make a melee spell attack against a
creature within 5 feet of you. On a
hit, the target takes 12d10 cold
damage. If the creature is killed
by this spell, it is petrified as
solid ice; if it is broken
while petrified this way,
the creature thaws to its
original state but suffers
whatever trauma or loss
of limbs that occurred
while it was frozen.
At Higher Levels.
When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of
8th level or higher, the
cold damage increases by
1d10 for every slot level
above 7th.
