While casting this spell you must name another
spell and choose one creature within range. You
must cast the named spell on your next turn. The
creature you chose must be the target of that spell,
or included in its effects. They will automatically be
hit if the spell requires an attack roll, will
automatically fail their saving throw of the spell
allows one, and will become vulnerable to the type
of damage the spell inflicts. If the named spell
persists for more than one round the named
creature regains damage resistance and immunities
and can make saving throws as normal after the first
round.
