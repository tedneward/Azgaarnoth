#### Vaporize
*9th-level transmutation* (Cleric,Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shattered quartz crystal)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create up to four 20-foot cubes. Any creature or
structure made of earth (crystal, dirt, stone, mud,
metal etc.) inside the cube must make a Dexterity
saving throw. They take 10d10 force damage on a
failed save, or half as much on a successful one. This
spell deals double damage to structures and ignores
the damage threshold for large structures. If the
creature or structure is reduced to 0 hit points, it is
turned into a thick grey mist that fills the cube.
Everything within the mist is heavily obscured for
everyone except the caster, who can see normally.
The mist lasts for 1 minute, or until dispersed by a
strong wind.
