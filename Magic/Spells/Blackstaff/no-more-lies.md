You can roll a d10 and add the number rolled to the
triggering ability check. In addition, any creature
you can see within range must make a Constitution
saving throw if it is a shapechanger, a spellcaster
concentrating on a transmutation or illusion spell,
or currently the subject of a spell that has altered its
form. On a failure, the creature instantly reverts to
its original form (if applicable), and if it is
maintaining concnetration on a spell, the spell is
suppressed until the end of your next turn. At that
time, any suppressed spell resumes, provided that
its duration has not expired in the meantime.
