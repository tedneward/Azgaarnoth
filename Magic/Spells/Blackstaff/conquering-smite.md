The next time you hit a creature with a weapon
attack before this spell ends, you drive your foe to
the ground. The attack deals an extra 2d6 psychic
damage to the target, and the target must make
Dexterity saving throw. If they fail the save, the
target falls prone. Until the start of your next turn,
if the target stands up from being prone, you may
use your reaction to make one melee attack against
the target.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
