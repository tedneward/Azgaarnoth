___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self (30 feet)
- **Components:** V, S, M (an offering, see spell)
- **Duration:** 1 week
---
You summon a nightmare from the lower planes to
serve as mount. You must present an offering to the
nightmare to ensure its loyalty, but what the
nightmares want varies wildly from one to another.
A soul of a young child is the often a safe choice. If
the nightmare approves of the offering it will serve
the spellcaster for one week before returning to the
lower planes. Casting this spell again will summon a
new nightmare or the same one, depending on the
caster's desire. If the nightmare disapproves of the
offering it disappears in a cloud of rancid smoke. If
the offering is particularly lacking, the nightmare
may return with allies.
