___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon that inflicts slashing or piercing damage)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
Once you cast this spell, your speed is reduced to 0
until the start of your next turn. However, as part of
the action used to cast this spell, you can choose
any number of creatures within 5 feet of you and
make one melee weapon attack against each one,
making a separate attack roll for each target. Each
melee attack must be made with a weapon that does
not have the two-handed or heavy property.
If you are wielding two weapons (one in each
hand) that both inflict piercing or slashing damage,
for each of these melee attacks you choose which of
the two weapons you use to make the attack.
At the end of the turn, each creature you
attacked as part of the action of casting takes
magical slashing damage equal to your spellcasting
ability modifier, whether you hit or missed.
While this spell is active, if you have a weapon in
each hand, until the start of your next turn, when a
creature provokes an opportunity attack from you,
you can use a special reaction granted by this spell
instead of making a normal opportunity attack. You
use this special reaction to attack the provoking
creature twice, once with each of your two weapons.
