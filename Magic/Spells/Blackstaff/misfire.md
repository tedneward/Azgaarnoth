You gesture toward a creature wishing it ill luck.
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature has disadvantage on ranged
attacks of any kind for the duration. If the creature
attempts to make a ranged attack while under this
spell's effect and misses, it must make a second
ranged attack roll against itself. On a hit, the
creature takes the attack's damage. The creature
can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each
of its turns, and on a success, the spell ends for that
creature. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can affect one
additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
