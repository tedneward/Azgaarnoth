*Enchantment cantrip (Artificer,Bard,Warlock)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a ranged weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a ranged weapon attack against a
creature within range, otherwise the spell fails. On a
hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects,
and your enchanted shot renders your foe
unaccountably clumsy. It has disadvantage on the
next attack roll it makes before the start of your
next turn. If that attack misses, it falls prone and
the spell ends. This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the attack deals an extra
1d4 psychic damage to the target. This extra damage
increases to 2d4 at 11th level and 3d4 at 17th level.
