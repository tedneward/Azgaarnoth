- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You channel the essence of Tharizdun, god of
entropy, through yourself into the sky. Every
creature within range must make a Dexterity saving
throw. They take 10d6 acid, fire, or poison damage
(caster's choice) on a failed saving throw and half as
much on a successful one. This spell fouls rivers,
destroys forests and devastates towns and castles.
Thousands of innocent lives could be lost.
Casting this spell is an unquestionably evil act.
Other gods take notice, and often warn their
followers or send servants to deal with you directly.
Channeling the essence of entropy takes a direct toll
on the caster as well: when you cast this spell, you
take 10d6 necrotic damage, and must roll 1d6 and
permanently decrease your Constitution by the
number rolled. This damage cannot reduced or
resisted in any way.
