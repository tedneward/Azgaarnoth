___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a medusa's eye)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Your eyes turn to stone, although you can see
normally. You can use your action to force any
creature within range to make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failure, it is restrained and its skin
begins turning to stone.
A creature restrained by this spell must repeat the
Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its
turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell
ends and the creature is no longer restrained. If the
creature fails three Constitution saving throws
before it attains three successes, it is petrified,
turning permanently into stone.
