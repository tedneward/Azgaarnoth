#### Necrotic Web
*8th-level evocation* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of phase spider venom)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a 30-foot cube filled with shadowy, life-
draining webs for the duration. The area is difficult
terrain and heavily obscured. If the webs are not
anchored to a solid object or layered across a floor,
wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself and fades
away, ending the spell.
A creature that starts its turn in, or moves into
the web during its turn must make Dexterity saving
throw. If it fails it is restrained. A restrained
creature can use its action to make Strength check
against your spell save DC. On a success, it is no
longer restrained.
A creature that ends its turn restrained by the
webs must make a Constitution saving throw,
taking 6d8 necrotic damage on a failed save or half
as much on a success.
