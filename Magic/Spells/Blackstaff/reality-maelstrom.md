With a crack of lightning and thunder, a 20-foot
radius spherical rip in space and time appears,
centered on a point you choose within range. All
loose materials weighing under 100 pounds within
the sphere are sucked into the center of the
maelstrom and transported to a random plane of
existence. Similarly, any creatures caught within the
sphere must make a Wisdom saving throw or be
pulled into the maelstrom and transported. All
objects and creatures sucked into the maelstrom are
transported to the same plane of existence.
The maelstrom has a secondary windstorm effect
that extends 40 feet from the center of the sphere.
All unattended objects weighing 50 pounds or less
in the extended area are pulled 20 feet closer toward
the maelstrom's center, and then sucked into the
rift and transported. A creature within the extended
area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failure, it is pulled 20 feet closer to the center  of the
sphere. Any creature pulled into the sphere must
make the Wisdom saving throw, being transported
to another plane on a failure.
Each time this spell is cast, roll on the following
table to determine the destination for any objects or
creatures transported to another plane.
