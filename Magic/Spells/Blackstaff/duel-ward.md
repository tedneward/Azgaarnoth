#### Duel Ward
*5th-level abjuration* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
For the duration of this spell, whenever you use
your reaction to cast a spell with a casting time of 1
reaction during another creature's turn, you can
cast one more spell of 5th-level or lower that has a
casting time of 1 reaction before the end of that
creature's turn, even though your reaction has
already been used (this is an exception to the rule
that you can only cast one spell of 1st-level or higher
per turn). Spells cast in this way still use spell slots
normally.
In addition, for the duration of this spell, you gain
a +2 bonus on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and on all ability checks for your spellcasting ability that do
not already include your proficiency bonus.
