#### Beastlands Ferocity
*1st-level enchantment* (Bard,Druid,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
This spell imbues a creature you touch with the
ferocity of a wild beast. The next time the target
takes damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points
before the spell ends, it makes a Constitution saving
throw. The DC equals 10 + the damage taken, unless
it is less than 10 damage, in which case the saving
throw succeeds automatically. On a success, the
creature is reduced to 1 hit point instead, and the
spell ends.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell does not
end the first time the target succeeds on the
required saving throw. For a spell slot of 3rd or 4th
level, the spell doesn't end until the second time the
target succeeds on the save. If the spell slot is 5th or
6th level, the spell doesn't end until the third
successful saving throw. If the slot is 7th or 8th
level, it is the fourth successful save that ends the
spell. For a 9th-level spell slot, the spell last for the
full duration, no matter how many times the target
succeeds on the saving throw.
