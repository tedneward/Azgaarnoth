You surround yourself with
the burning rage of the
demon lords, emitting a 10-foot
aura around yourself. For the
duration, at the start of each
of your turns, each creature
within this 10-foot aura
must make a Dexterity saving throw, and flammable objects in the aura
that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature
takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or
half as much on a success. Any creature that
touches you or hits you with a melee attack while it
is within 10 feet of you must also make this saving
throw. A creature cannot take damage from this
spell more than once in the same turn.
