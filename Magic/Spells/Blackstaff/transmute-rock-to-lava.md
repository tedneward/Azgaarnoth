#### Transmute Rock to Lava
*9th-level transmutation* (Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You transform a natural area of stone within range
of up to 10 cubic feet in volume into an equal
volume of white-hot lava. A creature caught in the
area when the spell is cast must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
15d6 fire damage, or half as much on a successful
one. A creature that starts its turn in the area must
make a Dexterity saving throw and take fire damage
until it is no longer in the affected area.
If the rock transformed by this spell supported a
structure, that structure takes the fire damage (and
ignites if it is flammable), and also takes extra
bludgeoning damage equal to half the fire damage.
If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and
potentially damages nearby creatures, as described
in the earthquake spell. After 10 minutes, the lava
cools and turns back into rock.
