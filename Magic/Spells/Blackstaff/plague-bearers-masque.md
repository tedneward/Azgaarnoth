#### Plague Bearer's Masque
*4th-level illusion* (Cleric,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vile of pus)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
The creature you touch must make a Wisdom
saving throw. On a failure, its features immediately
change, making it appear to be the bearer of a
terrible and highly contagious plague. The illusion
is olfactory, tactile, and visual. Any creatures that
can see the creature must make a Wisdom saving
throw. Any that fail are frightened of the plague
bearer for the duration. A creature frightened of the
plague bearer can repeat the Wisdom save at the
end of each of its turns. On a success, it is no longer
frightened by the plague bearer.
The plague bearer or any creature not frightened
of it can use an action to inspect the various oozing
pores and rancid flesh, making an Intelligence
(Investigation or Medicine) check against your
spellcasting save DC. On a success, the spell ends.
