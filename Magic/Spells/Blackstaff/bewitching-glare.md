Your unsettling gaze catches the enemy's eye just as
it attacks, rattling it enough to interfere with its
strike. The target suffers disadvantage on the
triggering attack. If the attack misses, the target
takes 2d6 psychic damage, and you can pull the
target up to 5 feet closer to you.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the psychic
damage inflicted increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 2nd.
