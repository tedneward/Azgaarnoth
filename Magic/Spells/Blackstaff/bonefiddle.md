An ethereal fiddle bow
appears next to one
creature that you can see
within range. The fiddle
bow immediately starts to
target creature. Your
target must make a
Constitution save. If
they fail, they take 2d8
slashing damage at the
beginning of their turn
for the duration. The
target make a
Constitution save at the
end of each of its turns
to end the spell. The
spell's effects continue
even if the target
moves out of your line
of sight or beyond the
spell's range. The
spell ends if it enters an
area of magical silence
(such as the silence spell).
The music produced by
bonefiddle is hauntingly beautiful and
harmonizes with your victim's screams
of pain.
