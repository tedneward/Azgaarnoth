You choose a 20-foot
cube within range and fill
it with dense vapors that
dissolve flesh and bone. Each
creature within the cube
must make a Constitution
saving throw. A target takes
6d6 acid damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Any creature that begins its turn inside the cube
must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
takes 6d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as
much on a successful one.
In addition, everything within the fog is heavily
obscured. Because the vapors are semisolid, the area
of the fog is also difficult terrain.
