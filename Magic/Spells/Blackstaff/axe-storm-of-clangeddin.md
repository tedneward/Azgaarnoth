#### Axe Storm of Clangeddin
*4th-level transmutation* (Cleric,Paladin)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (50 foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a battleaxe devoted to Clangeddin or Morain)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
For the duration of the spell, every dwarf within
range (including duergar, derro, and even creatures
that are only half-dwarf) is immune to being
frightened and gains an additional action on each of
its turns. That extra action can be used only to take
the Attack action and make one weapon attack
only. If an affected dwarf is armed with a handaxe,
battleaxe, or greataxe, their attacks with that
weapon count as magical for the purpose of
overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical
attacks and damage.
