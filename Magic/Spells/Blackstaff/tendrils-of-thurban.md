The ice seems to freeze in your lungs as an emerald
green star appears in the sky. Tendrils the same
color reach down from inside that frozen star and
lift your opponents into the air, squeezing the life
out of them. Choose a number of targets within
range that and within 30 feet of each other equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier. They take 2d10
cold damage and 2d10 bludgeoning damage and are
restrained 10 feet in the air on a failed save. They
take half damage and are not restrained on a
successful saving throw. Targets restrained by the
tendrils take 2d10 cold damage and 2d10
bludgeoning damage at the start of their turns. A
restrained target may make a Strength check
against your spell save DC to escape the tendrils.
