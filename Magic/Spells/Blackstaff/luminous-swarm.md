You summon a swarm of bright motes made of pure
force. They emit bright light out to 10 feet and dim
light for 10 feet beyond that. Anyone who attempts
to attack you in melee is swarmed by these moats.
The moats dig into your opponent's eyes and
mouth, making breathing and vision nearly
impossible. You may use your reaction to impose
disadvantage on a melee attack that targets you or
someone within 10 feet of you.
