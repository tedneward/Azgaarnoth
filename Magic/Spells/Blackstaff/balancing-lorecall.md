#### Balancing Lorecall
*2nd-level transmutation* (Artificer,Bard,Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a thin wooden dowel at least 3-inches in length)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
Until the spell ends, you gain the ability to move up,
down, and across any horizontal, sloping, or vertical
surface capable of bearing at least half your weight.
You leave your hands free while doing so, even
when moving across surfaces where balancing is
practically impossible. For the duration, you also
gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed,
proficiency in the Acrobatics skill, advantage on all
Dexterity (Acrobatics) and Strength (Athletics)
checks. While this spell is active, you do not sink when
moving over soft or brittle terrain, such as dust, silt,
mud, snow, or thin ice (though you cannot walk on
actual liquid with this effect), and difficult terrain of
those types does not require extra movement.
If you are already sinking into soft terrain when
you cast this spell, the spell instantly moves you up
to 5 feet towards the surface. When this spell ends,
if you are standing in a place where you would
normally fall or sink, you do so unless you have
some other means of remaining there.
