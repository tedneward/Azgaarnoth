#### Decelerating Slash
*4th-level transmutation* (WARNING: NO CLASSES LISTED)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the
spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's
normal effects, its speed is reduced by 5 feet for the
duration, and it cannot take reactions until the start
of its next turn. On a miss, the target takes psychic
damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier,
and the spell ends. This spell also ends early if you
are incapacitated or you die.
For the duration, the target you hit with the
melee weapon attack for this spell must make an
Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of its
turns, ending the spell on a success. If it fails the
save, until the spell ends, the creature cannot take
reactions, bonus actions, or the Dash action.
In addition, each time a creature fails its saving
throw against this spell, its speed is reduced by an
additional 5 feet (which is cumulative with previous
reductions to its speed from this spell), and one ally
of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you
or the target can move up to 5 feet without
provoking opportunity attacks.
