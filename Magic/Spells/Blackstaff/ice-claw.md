When you cast this spell, a large reptilian-like
claw surrounded by a cold chill appears in an
unoccupied spot of your choice within range.
On the turn you cast this spell, and on each of
your turns for the spell's duration, you can use a
bonus action to direct the claw to move up to 30
feet and make one grapple attack against a creature.
The claw's bonus for the grapple check is equal to 7
+ your spellcasting ability modifier. A grappled
creature is also restrained, and takes 2d6 cold
damage at the start of each of its turns.
The claw can be attacked. It has an AC of 20, and
a number of hit points equal to your normal hit
point maximum. In addition, the claw makes saving
throws using your bonuses, but has immunity to
cold damage, and vulnerability to fire.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the claw's grapple
bonus and Armor Class both increase by 1, and the
amount of cold damage increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 7th.
