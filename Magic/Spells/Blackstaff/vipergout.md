*7th-level conjuration* (Druid,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a snakeskin, which you swallow during the casting of the spell)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You summon vipers which leap forth from your
mouth to attack your enemies. Choose three
unoccupied spaces that you can see within 30 feet.
Three giant poisonous snakes  under your control
leap from your mouth to land in each space.
Until the spell ends, on each of your turns, you
can summon up to three more giant poisonous
snakes from your mouth as a bonus action.
Giant poisonous snakes created by this spell are
considered fiends. They are immune to fire damage
and poison damage, and they can see normally in
darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a
distance of 120 feet.
If you have six or more summoned snakes present
when your turn ends, the snakes begin to swallow
each other whole. At the end of your turn, half the
snakes vanish unless there are five or fewer of them.
For each snake that vanishes, one of the remaining
snakes gains temporary hit points equal to the hit
points of that vanished snake. No snake can gain
more than 10 temporary hit points in this way at a
time.
The snakes are friendly to you and your
companions. They act on your initiative,
immediately after your turn ends, but have their
own turns. For the duration of the spell, you can
issue mental commands to the snakes (no action
required by you), and they obey any commands that
you issue to them. If you don't issue any commands
to them, they defend themselves from hostile
creatures, but otherwise take no actions.
Each snake vanishes when it drops to 0 hit points
or when the spell ends, leaving only an empty
snakeskin.
The spell ends early once you have summoned a
total of 24 snakes or if you choose to stop
concentrating on it. Until the spell ends, you cannot
speak, cast spells with verbal components, or
activate items that require speech.
