You move with preternatural grace, leaping onto or
over tall obstacles that impede your foes. Until the
spell ends, you gain the following benefits:
* Your speed increases by 10 feet
* You have resistance to damage from falling
* Your jumping distance is tripled
* You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking
speed
* Your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain
or squeezing
* Spells and other magical effects cannot reduce
your speed.
Once before the spell ends, you can give yourself
advantage on one weapon attack roll on your turn.
That attack deals an extra 1d10 force damage on a
hit. Whether you hit or miss, you gain a flying speed
equal to your walking speed until the end of that
turn.
