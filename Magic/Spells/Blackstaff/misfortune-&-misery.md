Make a melee spell attack against a creature within
reach. On a hit, you can curse one of the target's
ability scores of your choice. The creature has
disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and
saving throws with the chosen ability for the spell's
duration. The creature can attempt a Wisdom
saving throw at the end of each of its turns; on a
successful save, the creature can end one of the
disadvantages affecting it (either ability checks,
attack rolls, or saving throws). Once a creature
makes three saving throws, the spell ends for that
creature.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can affect one
additional creature for each slot level above 5th.
