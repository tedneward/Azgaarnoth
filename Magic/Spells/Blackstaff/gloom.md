You cause a 120-foot radius of gloom to cover an
area centered on a point you can see within range.
The area suppresses daylight and other light
sources, causing a twilight effect. Areas within the
gloom where light sources are suppressed are
considered lightly obscured for the duration.
Creatures with sunlight sensitivity do not suffer
penalties while within the area and nonmagical
light sources have their illumination reduced to a 5-
foot radius. Spells of lower level than the spell slot
used to cast this spell that produce a light effect are
dispelled when contacting the area or fail if cast
within it.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the
effect increases by 10 feet for every slot level above
4th.
