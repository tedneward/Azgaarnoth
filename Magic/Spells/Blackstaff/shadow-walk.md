#### Shadow Walk
*7th-level abjuration* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 4 hours
---
You and a creature you touch are transported to the
border of the Shadowfell, where you can travel at a
rate of 7 miles per hour and then re-enter the
Material plane at a location you know.
Alternatively, you can choose to enter the
Demiplane of Shadow and then travel to where it
borders another plane of existence, and then exit at
that location.
Instead of transporting a willing creature, you can
make a melee spell attack as part of the same action
used to cast this spell to touch an unwilling creature
within your reach. On a hit, the creature is
transported to the Demiplane of Shadow while you are transported to a space within 5 feet of it or to
the border the material plane (your choice). If the
creature doesn't find an exit to another plane before
the spell ends, it is transported to a random plane
that borders the Demiplane of Shadow.
