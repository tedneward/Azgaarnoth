#### Barbed Construct
*8th-level conjuration* (Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small knot of inscribed barbed wire)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You hurl a small knot of inscribed barbed wire,
which grows and springs to life, attacking your foes
and protecting you from harm. The magical
construct you summon appears in an unoccupied
space that you can see within range. The barbed
construct has the same statistics as a shield
guardian  (your DM has these statistics) except that
it does not have the Spell Storing trait, its Fist
attacks inflict piercing damage, and the amulet to
which it is bound appears as a temporary glowing
tattoo around your neck (your DM has statistics for
shield guardians). The barbed construct disappears
when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The barbed construct obeys any verbal
commands you issue to it. Roll initiative for the
barbed construct, which has its own turns. If you
don't issue any commands to the construct, it
defends itself from hostile creatures and uses its
Shield reaction to protect you but otherwise takes
no actions.
