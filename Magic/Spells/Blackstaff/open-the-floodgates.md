---
You release a burst of previously contained
emotions, unleashing a fury that batters your
enemies' minds. Each creature of your choice in a
20-foot radius sphere centered on you must make
an Intelligence saving throw. A target takes 6d10
psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. Also on a failed save, a
target is deafened and has disadvantage on attack
rolls and on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
saving throws until the end of your next turn.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.
