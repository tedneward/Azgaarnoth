This spell can only be cast on a specific creature one
time. The recipient gains three d20s that it can use
when needed. When it rolls a d20 to make an attack
roll, ability check, or saving throw, it can roll one of
the d20s granted by this spell and use its result
instead. The creature can choose to roll the d20
after rolling the first die, but before it knows the
result. Once the second die is rolled, it can choose
to use either result. Only one extra die can be used
for any one check. Once a die is rolled, it is
expended. Once all the dice have been used, the
spell ends.
