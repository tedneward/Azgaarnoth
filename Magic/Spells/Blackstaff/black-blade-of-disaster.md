#### Black Blade of Disaster
*9th-level conjuration* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a black, blade-shaped planar void that
you grasp with your hand. For the duration, you can
use your action to make a melee spell attack against
any target within 5 feet of you. On a hit, your target
takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. A creature reduced to
0 hit points by the blade is disintegrated (as if by
the disintegrate  spell). A disintegrated creature and
everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic
items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The
creature can be restored to life only by means of a
true resurrection  or a wish spell. If you drop the
blade or let go of it for any reason, the spell ends if
it is not back in your hand at the end of your next
turn.
