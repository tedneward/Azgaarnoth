You create a perfect picture of
everything within 30 feet of you,
which is permanently captured in
the crystal sphere. The sphere
records a perfect image of
everything within 30 feet of it. As
an action, you can withdraw the
picture from the sphere
at any point as an
illusory image. You
choose the picture's
size, from 6 inches
to 15 feet in
diameter. You can
withdraw the picture as often as
you wish. If you cast the spell again, you can place a
new picture within the sphere, but the old one is
lost.
