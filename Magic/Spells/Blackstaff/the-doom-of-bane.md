#### The Doom of Bane
*6th-level necromancy* (Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a suit of plate armor and a longsword)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You touch the corpse of an evilly aligned humanoid
that has been dead for no longer than eight hours.
The creature rises and dons the suit of armor and
wields the longsword as it finishes its
transformation into a helmed horror  (your DM
has helmed horror statistics). It serves you and acts
on its own initiative, aiding you to the best of its
abilities. If it drops to 0 hit points, it turns to dust,
along with the plate armor and longsword.
This spell fails if you attempt to cast it again while
a helmed horror is in your service.
