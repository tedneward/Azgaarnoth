elemental energy of the type you choose (acid, cold,
fire, lightning, or thunder) bursts outward from you
in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in the area must
make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature takes 6d6 of the elemental damage type
you selected, and it is knocked prone. On a
successful save, the creature takes half the damage
and isn't knocked prone.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the elemental
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
3rd.
