You fill a 30-foot radius sphere around yourself area with the essence of the Feywild, strengthening its bonds to the natural world. The spell is centered on you when it is cast, but its area does not move with you. Within the area of the spell, whenever an aberration, fiend, and or undead creature makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw. In the same area, whenever a beast, plant, or fey creature makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, rolls a d4 and adds the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.
If you cast zone of natural purity in the same location every day for a year, the spell becomes permanent.
