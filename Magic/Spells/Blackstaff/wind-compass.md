While casting this spell you choose a compass
tune plays softly in your ear. The tune isn't
distracting, and stops if you walk in any other
direction. You must choose a compass direction;
you cannot choose a landmark or a specific
individual. Until this spell ends, you cannot become
lost except by magical means, and you have
advantage on saving throws against becoming
charmed or frightened.
