You infuse a weapon you touch with the energies of
one of the Outer Planes, energies which correspond
strongly to certain ethical or moral alignments and
inflict extra damage against certain types of
creatures. When you cast this spell, choose one of
these four planes:
* Elysium (Good):  Aberrations, chromatic
dragons, elementals, fiends, or undead.
* Hades (Evil):  Beasts, celestials, metallic
dragons, humanoids, or plants.
* Limbo (Chaos):  Constructs, angels, dragons,
devils, or giants.
* Mechanus (Law):  Aberrations, demons, fey,
monstrosities, oozes, or undead. Until the spell ends, the weapon inflicts an
additional 2d6 force damage against the types of
creatures listed for the chosen plane.
Your alignment may limit your choice of planar
energies when you cast this spell. If you are evil-
aligned, you cannot choose Elysium; if you are
good-aligned, you cannot choose Hades, if you are
lawful in alignment, you cannot choose Limbo; if
your alignment is chaotic, you cannot choose
Mechanus.
