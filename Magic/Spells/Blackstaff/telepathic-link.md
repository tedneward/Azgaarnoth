#### Telepathic Link
*1st-level divination* *(ritual)* (Sorcerer)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You establish a telepathic link with one willing
humanoid you touch. Until the spell ends,
whenever you and the target can see each other,
each of you can communicate with the other via
telepathy.
Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less
aren't affected by this spell. You don't need to share
a language with a creature for it to understand your
telepathic utterances, and the creature understands
you even if it lacks a language. The creature can
respond to you telepathically as well, but it must
understand at least one language in order to
communicate this way.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration
increases to 10 minutes, and if either you or the
creature you are linked to are surprised, while both
of you can see each other, the surprised creature
can still act normally during the surprise round, as
if it were not surprised.
