When you cast this spell, one weapon of your
choice or up to twenty pieces of ammunition within
range glow with radiant energy. An affected weapon
sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius, deals radiant
damage instead of its normal damage type, and
ignores non-living material, causing attacks with
the affected weapon against creatures wearing
armor or using shields to be made with advantage.
In addition, undead creatures are considered
vulnerable to the damage caused by a weapon
affected by this spell. However, these weapons also
inflict damage on constructs as if they had
resistance to radiant damage.
