#### Cacophonic Shield
*5th-level evocation* (Bard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You emit a rhythmic droning sound that creates a
10-foot radius sonic barrier around you, and which
moves with you. Creatures on either side of the
barrier perceive it as a harmless buzzing sound.
However, the barrier disrupts both magical and
nonmagical missiles fired into or out of it, causing
disadvantage on ranged attack rolls.
The barrier can also disrupt spells that deal
thunder damage. A spellcaster attempting to cast a
spell that deals thunder damage into the area must
make an ability check for their spellcasting ability,
against a DC equal to your spell save DC. On a
successful check, the spell works normally, but it is
dispelled on a failed check.
A creature that attempts to cross the barrier in
either direction must make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature is deafened for
1 minute and takes 4d6 thunder damage. The
creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end
of each of its turns, and on a success, it is no longer
deafened. If the creature succeeded on its saving
throw when it crossed the barrier, it takes half the
thunder damage and isn't deafened. A creature
made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or
metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.
A creature that is forced to cross the barrier is not
affected by the cacophonic shield  for that
movement.
A creature made of inorganic material such as
stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this
saving throw.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
