#### Circle of Privacy
*4th-level transmutation* *(ritual)* (Artificer,Druid,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 25-foot radius circle
- **Components:** V, S, M (salt)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
The caster sprinkles salt in a circle around a
campfire, tent, or some other central object. Natural
predators and curious passer-byes are magically
discouraged from looking too closely at the area
enclosed by the circle.
Sights, sounds and smells inside the circle are
masked and muted, and anyone just passing by is
unlikely to even notice your camp. Any Wisdom
(Perception) checks to find you are made with
disadvantage.
This spell does not protect against any form of
magical detection.
