#### Misdirected Mark
*1st-level illusion* (Bard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You conceal your arcane attack, mentally
influencing your foe into both believing the attack
came from one of your allies and focusing on that
ally obsessively. Make a ranged spell attack against
a target within range. On a hit, the target takes 4d6
psychic damage, and you choose one creature
friendly to you who is within 30 feet of both you and
the target. That friendly creature marks the target
until the end of your next turn.
While a creature marked with this spell is within
5 feet of you of the friendly creature that marked it,
it has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't
target that friendly creature. This spell ends early if
the friendly creature dies or is incapacitated, or if
the target marked with this spell is marked by a
creature besides the friendly creature.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
