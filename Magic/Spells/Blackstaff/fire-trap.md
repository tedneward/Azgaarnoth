You touch one closable, inanimate item and
designate a password. If someone opens the item
without saying the password, the item explodes in a
ball of flame. Each creature within 10 feet must
make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 4d6
fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. The item itself takes no
damage from this spell.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a 3rd level or higher spell slot, the damage increases
by 1d6, or you may extend the area of effect by 5
feet, for each slot level above 2nd.
