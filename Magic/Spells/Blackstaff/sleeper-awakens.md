---
A corona of white psychic energy emanates from
your head and eyes as you enter a combat trance
that allows you to anticipate your enemy's actions.
For the duration, no attack against you can benefit
from advantage, opportunity attacks are made
against you with disadvantage, and you gain
advantage on Wisdom checks to discern
information about creatures that are not friendly to
you. In addition, until the spell ends, whenever an
attack roll is made against you or a friendly creature
within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to
move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity
attacks.
