A shower of radiance falls upon your enemies and
then bursts out, creating a cage of burning embers
that are painful to pass through. Choose a 10-foot
cube within range. Each creature in the cube must
make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d4 radiant
damage if it fails. Until the start of your next turn,
the area of the cube is lightly obscured, and the next
time a creature leaves the area, it takes 1d4 fire
damage and the spell ends. When you reach 5th
level, the radiant damage and fire damage both
increase to 2d4. Both damage rolls increase to 3d4
at 11th level, and 4d4 at 17th level.
