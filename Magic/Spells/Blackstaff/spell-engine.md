When you cast this spell, a light appears above you
that provides illumination in a 30-foot radius. While
studying your spellbook under this light, you may
swap out any of the spells you have prepared,
trading each spell you choose to swap out for a new
one of the same level. Normally, preparing each new
spell takes 1 minute per level of that spell, but while
this spell is active, the preparation time is halved.
This spell does not refresh any spent spell slots.
