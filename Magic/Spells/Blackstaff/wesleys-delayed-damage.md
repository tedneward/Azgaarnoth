You push some of the damage you take forward in
time, increasing your effectiveness or the short
term. For the duration of the spell, you take half
damage from all attacks that inflict hit point
damage. You must keep track of how much damage
you take while this spell is in effect.
Once the spell ends, you immediately take all the
damage you took while the spell was in effect again.
This damage cannot be reduced or avoided in any
way.
