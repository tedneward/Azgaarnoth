- **Duration:** 1 round
---
Blazing light coalesces over your ally to form a
crown of radiance that sears surrounding foes.
Choose an ally you can see within range. Every
hostile creature within 5 feet of that ally must make
a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6
radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
In addition, the chosen ally gains temporary hit
points equal to 5 + your spellcasting ability
modifier, and it is considered proficient with all
saving throws until the end of its next turn.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
