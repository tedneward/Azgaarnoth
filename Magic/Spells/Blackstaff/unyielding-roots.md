#### Unyielding Roots
*8th-level transmutation* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S,
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You touch a creature that is standing on the ground
(such as soil, rock, or a street). For the duration, the
creature's speed is reduced to 0, and all attempts to
move it from its current space automatically fail,
whether or not the creature is willing to be moved.
Effects that would move the creature only succeed if
they would also move all solid ground within 5 feet
of it.
In addition, the affected target gains life
preserving energy from its connection with the
ground. Until the spell ends, the creature gains
advantage on Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom
saving throws, it is immune to poison damage and
the poisoned condition, and it regains hit points
equal to its maximum number of Hit Dice at the
start of each of its turns.
