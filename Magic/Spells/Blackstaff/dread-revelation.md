The next time you hit a creature with a weapon
attack before this spell ends, images of you and your
companions as daunting figures discourage your foe
from confronting you. The attack deals an extra 1d8
psychic damage to the target, and you can push the
target up to 5 feet away from you. In addition, the
next time the target makes an attack roll against
you or a creature friendly to you before the end of
its next turn, it takes psychic damage equal to your
spellcasting ability modifier.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage
increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
