*5th-level transmutation* (Paladin)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (your holy symbol)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You grow enormous as you are filled with holy
power. For the duration, your size increases by one
category (from Medium to Large, for example) and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution
checks and saving throws. In addition, your skin
hardens, giving you a +4 bonus to AC, and you have
resistance to necrotic damage.
Any equipment you carry or wear also grows.
Your melee weapons increase their reach by 5 feet,
and attacks you make with them inflict an
additional +2 damage. Your ranged weapons also
inflict an additional +2 damage, but their range is
unchanged.
After casting this spell, if you cast it again before
you finish a short or long rest, you must make a
Constitution saving throw at disadvantage, against a
DC equal to your own spellcasting DC plus the
number of times you have cast this spell since the
last time you finished a short or long rest. If you fail,
you fall unconscious for 1 minute, and the spell fails.
