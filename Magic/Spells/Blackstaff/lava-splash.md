- **Components:** V, S, M (a fist-sized lump of volcanic rock)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You conjure a wave of burning lava that rises up and
showers an area within range. The affected area is a
30-foot cone originating from a point you choose
within range. Each creature in that area must make
a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature
takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and 3d6 fire
damage, and its speed is reduced by half until the
end of its next turn.
The area of the spell becomes difficult terrain,
and the lava ignites flammable objects in the area
that aren't being worn or carried. The difficult
terrain cannot be cleared for 1 minute, after which
the lava cools. Each 5-foot-square portion of the
area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
Firenewts or
earth-based or fire-
based elemental
creatures (such as
gargoyles or
salamanders) do
not take damage
from this spell.
Instead, such a
creature is healed,
regaining hit points
equal to half the
fire damage
inflicted. Only
firenewts or
creatures of the
elemental type can
benefit from this
effect.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bludgeoning
damage and fire damage each increase by 1d6 for
each slot level above 3rd.
