___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous.
---
A blast of brilliant energy bursts outward in a 20-
foot radius around you and each creature caught in
the blast must make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 8d8 radiant
damage and is blinded for one minute. On a
successful save, the amount of damage is halved and
the creature is not blinded. Undead creatures have
disadvantage on this saving throw.
A creature blinded by this spell can try another
saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the
save is successful, the blinded condition ends.
This spell cancels any magical darkness it touches
if the darkness was created by a spell of equal level
or lower.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of
radiant damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 6th.
