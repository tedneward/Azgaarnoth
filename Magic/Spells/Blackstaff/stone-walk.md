This spell links any two buildings made of stone
that can be any distance apart but are both on the
same plane of existence. Each temple area must
have a stone platform large enough for one creature
to stand upon, which is used as a teleportation pad.
Before the spell is cast, each platform must be
prepared by crushing 2,000 gold pieces worth of
gemstones and performing a 10-minute ritual.
To complete the spell, you must perform another
10-minute ritual using the remaining 1,000 gold
pieces worth of crushed gemstones. During the final
ritual, a command word is chosen that will be used
to travel back and forth between the teleportation
pads. When the command word is spoken, one
person may be transported with up to 100 pounds of
gear.
Teleportation using this spell is infallible and
cannot be blocked by magical barriers or wards
against teleportation. If the destination pad is
blocked by solid matter, the traveller is sent to an
unoccupied space nearby.
