___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You permanently place a mark upon a character or
creature that identifies it as an enemy of your faith.
The chosen creature suffers the following effects:
* Any member of your faith feels innately hostile
towards the chosen creature, giving it
disadvantage on Charisma (Deception,
Performance, or Persuasion) checks against
members of your faith. This hostility might not
induce the viewer to attack, but the creature
will instinctively distrust or disbelieve anything
the marked one says.
* Members of your faith have advantage on
Wisdom checks against the chosen creature.
* The marked creature cannot benefit from any of
your faith's services, such as spellcasting
provided by a temple of your faith, or naming,
marrying, or burial services.
You can place the mark of the unfaithful upon
any creature, even if it is on a different plane. You
cannot cast this spell on someone who is already
dead. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers of your
faith automatically detect this effect simply by
looking at the subject.
The effect is permanent until lifted, either by you
or another member of your faith of high enough
level to cast this spell. This spell is unaffected by
dispel magic or counterspell, though it can be
copied or undone using a wish.
