You conjure a layer of translucent green energy
resembling plate armor, which emits noxious fumes
and corrodes attacking enemies. Choose an ally you
can see within range. That ally gains resistance
against acid damage, and until the spell ends, any
creature that touches that ally or hits it with a
melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 1d10 acid
damage. At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the acid damage
increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.
