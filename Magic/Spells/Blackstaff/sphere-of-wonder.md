#### Sphere of Wonder
*9th-level transmutation* (Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond sphere worth at least 10,000gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You throw the diamond sphere into the air and it
explodes into multicolored light. The light hangs in
the air above you and follows your movement. The
light emits bright light out to 30 feet and dim light
for 30 feet beyond.
When you cast the spell you choose one damage
type. Anyone, including you that casts a spell using
a different damage type within the light must make
a Wisdom saving throw. If they succeed the spell
works as normal. If they fail the spell is countered.
The spell has no effect on a spell that was cast out of
the light. The light automatically dispels magical
and natural darkness within 60 feet on you.
