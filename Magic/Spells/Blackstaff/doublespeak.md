#### Doublespeak
*2nd-level illusion* (Bard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tongue)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You choose a number of willing creatures within
range. For the duration, the targets can all
understand each other's speech, but no other
creature can understand it. Unless a creature
chooses to purposefully pay attention to what the
characters are saying, it sounds like a mundane and boring conversation, though the actual words are
difficult to follow.
Anyone trying to understand what the
ensorcelled creatures are saying must make a
Wisdom saving throw. A creature that succeeds on
the save can understand the targets' speech for 1
minute. At the end of that minute, if the creature
wishes to continue understanding the targets'
speech, it must repeat the Wisdom saving throw.
