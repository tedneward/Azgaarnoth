*4th-level necromancy* (Artificer,Paladin,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You temporarily become a creature of shadow,
flickering in and out of a demiplane on the borders
of the Shadowfell as your weapon ripples with dark
magic. Until the spell ends, you have resistance to
necrotic damage, and you inflict 3d4 additional
necrotic damage whenever you hit a creature with a
melee weapon attack.
For the duration, you roll a d20 at the end of each
of your turns. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish
from your current plane of existence and appear in
a shadowy reflection of it, which lies somewhere on
the planar boundary between your current location and the Shadowfell. (If you are already in the
Shadowfell when you cast this spell, the spell fails
and the casting is wasted.) At the start of you next
turn, and when the spell ends if you are in the
shadowy reflection, you return to an unoccupied
space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet
of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied
space is available within that range, you appear in
the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if
more than one space is equally near). You can
dismiss this spell as an action.
While in the shadowy reflection, you can see and
hear the plane you originated from, but everything
is lightly obscured, and you can't see anything more
than 30 feet away. You are not truly in the
Shadowfell nor in your previous location during
that time, but somewhere in between the planes.
Whenever you are in the shadowy reflection, only
other creatures with resistance or immunity to
necrotic damage can see you or affect you, or be
affected by you.
