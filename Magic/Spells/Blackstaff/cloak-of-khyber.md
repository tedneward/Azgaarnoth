When you cast this spell, you must already have
taken a form other than your own (by polymorph,
shapechanging, or another supernatural means),
and you must have been in the form for at least 8
hours, otherwise this spell fails. Until this spell
ends, as long as you bear the dragonshard you
enchant in the casting of this spell on your person,
no divination spell of 8th-level or lower can discern
any information that would reveal that your current
form to be a disguise. In addition, your alternate
form deceives even truesight,  and creatures with
truesight perceive your current form as being your
original one.
