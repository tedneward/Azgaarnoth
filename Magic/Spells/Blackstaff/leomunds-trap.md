---
This spell is cast on a device, such as a chest or door
lock. To a creature trained in thieves' tools, the
object appears to be trapped with a complex
mechanism that would be difficult to disarm. The
main purpose of the spell is to deter would-be
thieves.
A creature trained in thieves' tools and proficient
with the Investigation skill can spend an action to
make an Intelligence (Investigation) check with
disadvantage against your spellcasting DC. On a
successful check, the creature detects the ruse, and
can bypass the illusion to deal with the real device.
However, if the check is failed, all attempts to
somehow doesn't activate.
