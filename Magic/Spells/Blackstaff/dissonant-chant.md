___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You create discordant whispers that fill a 20-foot
radius within range. The whispers start at a low
volume, but quickly rise to a crescendo of blaring
and confusing voices that distract all creatures in
the area. Any spellcaster that attempts to cast a
spell within the area must make a Constitution
saving throw against your spell save DC, or the spell
fails. Likewise, a spellcaster in the affected area that
is concentrating on a spell at the start of its turn
must make a Constitution saving throw against your
spell save DC, or lose concentration on the spell.
In addition, any creature within the area has
advantage on saving throws against spells that
depend upon language, such as charm person.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the
effect increases by 10 feet for every slot level above
2nd.
