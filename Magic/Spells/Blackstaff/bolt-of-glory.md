You stretch out your hand and a bolt of blinding
energy leaps at your target. Make a ranged spell
attack at a target you can see within range. Undead,
fiends, and creatures with sunlight sensitivity take
10d8 radiant damage on a hit; aberrations, beasts,
constructs, elementals, monstrosities, oozes,
lycanthropes, and chromatic dragons take half as
much. Other creatures are not affected by this spell.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of
radiant damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 6th.
