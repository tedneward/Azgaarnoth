You surround yourself with a thick black shell that
shimmers with dark magic. Until the spell ends, you
gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class and Constitution
saving throws, and whenever a creature ends its
turn within 5 feet of you, it must make a Wisdom
saving throw unless it is immune to the fightened
condition. On a failure, you can push the creature
up to 15 feet away from you, and it is frightened of
you until the end of its next turn. On a success, you
can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you.
For the spell's duration, you also suffer
disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks.
