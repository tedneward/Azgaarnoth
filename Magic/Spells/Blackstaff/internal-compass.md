*Divination cantrip (Artificer,Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
With a moment's concentration, you sense which
way is true north. Until this cantrip ends, you
always know which way is north and cannot
become lost except by magical means. If you make a
Wisdom or Intelligence check to navigate natural
terrain, you may choose to roll a d6 and add the
number rolled to your result. If you do so, the spell
ends immediately.
