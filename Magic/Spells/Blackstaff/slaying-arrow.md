___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bolt or arrow)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You charge ammunition with energy that makes it
anathema to a creature. Choose one creature type
while casting; while casting you can fire the arrow
or bolt,or give it to an ally to fire on their turn. If
the arrow or bolt hits, and the creature struck is the
creature type named during the spell casting, the
creature must make a Constitution saving throw. A
creature with more than 50 hit points automatically
succeeds. On a failure, it does. On a success, the
arrow deals an extra 8d6 necrotic damage. This
extra damage ignores resistance and immunity.
