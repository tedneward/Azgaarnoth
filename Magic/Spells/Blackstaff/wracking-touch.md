---
Make a melee spell attack against a target within 5
feet of you. On a hit, the target starts to shake
uncontrollably and must make a Constitution save
at the start of its next turn. On a failure, it cannot
take actions until after the end of that turn. This
spell has no effect on constructs or undead. Once a creature has made a saving throw against this spell
(whether it succeeds or fails), it becomes immune
to the effects of this spell for 24 hours.
