___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a small ball of force at a point you
choose within range; the ball can be used to batter
your foes and attack objects that are not worn or
carried. As part of the action used to cast the spell,
and by using an action on each of your turns, you
can move the ball up to 30 feet within the spell's
range, and make a melee spell attack against a
creature or object.
If you hit a creature or object with the ball of
force, it takes 1d6 force damage and must make a
Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature is pushed 10 feet in the opposite direction
and falls prone. On a successful save, the creature
isn't pushed and doesn't fall prone.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the bludgeoning
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
2nd.
