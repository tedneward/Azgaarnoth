You chant and clap, targeting one creature within
range. That creature must make Wisdom saving
throw. If the creature saves the spell ends. If the
creature saves it immediately begins to dance along
with your chanting. For the duration you can use
your bonus action to force that creature can only
dance and clap on its turn. The creature gains +2 to
