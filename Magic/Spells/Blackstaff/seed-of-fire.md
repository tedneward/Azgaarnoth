Your attack leaves a glowing mote of arcane power
in your enemy's wound. As part of the action used
to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack
with a weapon against one creature within the
spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the
target suffers the attack's normal effects and you
push it 15 feet away from you, kicking your foe free
of your blade before it erupts in a blossom of hellish
flames. The target you hit and each creature within
10 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw or take 4d6 fire damage.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the fire damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
