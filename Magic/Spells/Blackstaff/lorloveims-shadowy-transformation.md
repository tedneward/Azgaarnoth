#### Lorloveim's Shadowy Transformation
*6th-level illusion* (Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You trap one creature or inanimate object you
touch between the plane you are on and the
Shadowfell. The target can make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell. If it fails, the creature
becomes insubstantial on both planes. It can see
into both planes, but can't tell which plane any
particular item or person is on. Anyone on the plane
the creature was on originally or in the Shadowfell
can see the creature or object as a shadowy,
transparent version of itself. Any attack targeting
the creature or object fails, and any attack launched
by the creature fails.
The creature can cast spells normally if those
spells do not require an attack roll, and can target
creatures on either plane, but cannot target
creatures on both planes with the same effect. This
spell has no effect when cast in the Shadowfell.
