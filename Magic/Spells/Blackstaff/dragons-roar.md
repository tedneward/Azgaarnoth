#### Dragon's Roar
*8th-level evocation* (Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
When you cast this spell, you emit an ear-splitting
roar. All enemies within range that can hear the
roar must make a Constitution saving throw. A
creature takes 12d6 thunder damage on a failed save
and is stunned until the end of its next turn. A
successful save halves the damage, and the creature
does not suffer the stunned condition.
In addition, all allies within range gain 20
temporary hit points, and gain advantage on the
next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw they
make during the next minute.
The sound of this spell can be heard up to 900
feet away (or farther with a successful Wisdom
(Perception) check as determined by your DM).
