#### Simbul's Spell Sequencer
*7th-level enchantment* (Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (pieces of amber worth a total of 5,000 gp, which are consumed in the casting of this spell)
- **Duration:** 1 year
---
You use several pieces of ancient amber to create a
matrix that contains spells you cast, frozen in time
until you need them. While casting this spell you
cast up to three spells of 1st through 3rd level, and
you choose a command word. When the command
word is spoken, all three spells take effect
immediately, in the order they were cast, as if you
had just cast all three of them in the same turn, and
the spell ends. At the time they are unleashed, you
make all decisions for each of these spells (targets,
area, etc.) that you would normally make as the
caster. You may only have one Simbul's spell
sequencer  active at a time.
Only spells with a casting time of 1 action or 1
bonus action can be cast into your spell sequencer.
When you create the sequencer, you reduce your
maximum Hit Dice by a number equal to the total
combined levels of the spell slots used to cast the
spells you place in it. Your maximum number of Hit
Dice does not return to normal until the spell ends.
If the duration expires and you did not speak the
command word, or if you choose to dismiss the
spell, the spell ends, and the other spells you cast
into your sequencer are lost.
