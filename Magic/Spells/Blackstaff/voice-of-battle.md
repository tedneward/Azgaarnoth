You emit a powerful battle cry that hammers your
enemy, distracting it from a nearby ally. Choose a
creature within range that is adjacent to one of your
allies. That target must make a Wisdom saving
throw. If the target fails the saving throw, it takes
1d6 thunder damage and you can choose one ally
that is within 5 feet of the target. That ally can use
its reaction to move up to 10 feet without provoking
an opportunity attack from the target. The sound of
the battle cry can be heard up to 100 feet away. This
spell's damage increases when you reach higher
levels, dealing 2d6 thunder damage at 5th level, 3d6
at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.
