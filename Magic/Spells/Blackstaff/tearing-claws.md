- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Spectral draconic claws strike out from your body,
slashing at your foes and shoving them backward.
Each creature in a 15-foot cone emanating from you
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, a creature takes 2d10 magical slashing damage
and is pushed 5 feet away from you. On a successful
save, the creature takes half damage and isn't
pushed.
Creatures that only have hit points equal to half
their hit point maximum or fewer have
disadvantage on the saving throw, and are pushed
back 15 feet on a failed saving throw.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage
increases by a 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
