*5th-level abjuration* (Artificer,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 12 hours
---
The target you touch is protected from the next
attack that would take it to 0 hit points. An attack
must deal at least 1 hit point of damage to trigger
this spell's effect. The recipient is reduced to 1 hit
point instead, but is otherwise unharmed. If the
attack incapacitates the victim another way, then
the spell has no effect.
