---
You shoot a bolt of blue flame at your enemy, who
shimmers for a second before teleporting to a place
of your choosing. Make a ranged spell check. On a
hit, you deal 5d6 psychic damage to the target and
it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure,
you can teleport it to any empty space you can see
within 30 feet of it where it would be on solid
ground that can support its weight. Once the target
is teleported, it immediately provokes opportunity
attacks from all creatures within 5 feet of it.
