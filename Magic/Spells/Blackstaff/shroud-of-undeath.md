You shroud yourself in necrotic energy, temporarily
gaining the traits of undeath. Your appearance does
not change except for a very slight pallor, but your
creature type changes to undead for the duration of
the spell.
Nonintelligent undead creatures perceive you as
one of their kind, ignoring you. Intelligent undead
do not immediately recognize you as alive, but may
question whether you are undead. Any ability check
made to determine that you are not truly undead is
made with disadvantage, and you have advantage
on all Charisma checks to convince others of your
undead nature.
If an undead creature does target you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must
make a Wisdom saving throw (an undead needn't
make the save when it includes you in an area
effect, such as the explosion or fireball). On a failed
saving throw, the creature must choose a new target
or forfeit targeting someone else, potentially
wasting the attack or spell. A creature automatically
succeeds on this saving throw if it has made a
successful saving throw against this effect within
the last 24 hours or it has seen you target an undead
creature with an attack or other harmful effect
within the last 24 hours.
Because you are undead, if a spell or other effect
states that it does not affect undead, then it does
not affect you for the spell's duration. Conversely,
effects that do affect undead (such as the Turn
Undead class feature) affect you as such.
