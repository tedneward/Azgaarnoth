- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You release the magical energy from one of the
elements in an explosive burst. The material
component of this spell depends on the element:
burning incense for air, soft clay for earth, sulphur
and phosphorus for fire, water and sand for water,
or any kind of vegetable matter for wood.
When you cast this spell, you choose a point
within range that contains one of the following five
elements of your choice: air, earth (which includes
soil, metal, or stone), fire, water, or wood. That
material releases its elemental energy. Each creature
within a 15-foot cone emanating from that point
must make a saving throw. The victim takes 2d6
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
The type of saving throw required and damage
inflicted depend on the element, as determined by
the following table: In addition to taking damage, each creature that
fails its saving throw suffers an additional effect,
depending on the element type. These effects are
detailed below, along with descriptions of each
element's exact effect:
Air. There is a sudden flash of light and peal of
thunder as a gust of wind whips up out of nowhere,
heavy with static electricity that shocks those
nearby. Creatures that fail their save are knocked
prone. Objects that aren't being worn or carried
become electrified, inflicting 1d6 lightning damage
on the next person who touches them within the
next minute.
Earth. Clumps of metal and rock spray out,
oozing a corrosive substance. Creatures who fail
their save are pushed back 10 feet away from the
point at the center of the effect, as are objects
weighing less than 100 lbs. that aren't being worn or
carried.
Fire. The fire shoots out glowing sparks. It ignites
flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn
or carried, and creatures who fail their save take an
additional 1d6 damage at the beginning of their next
turn.
Water. Icy water pushes out in a freezing wave
that crashes into those nearby. Creatures who fail
their save reduce their speed by half until the end of
their next turn, and objects weighing less than 100
pounds that aren't being worn or carried are pushed
back 15 feet away from the point at the center of the
effect.
Wood. The element throws off sharp slivers of
the same material as itself, infused with a poisonous
sap. Creatures who fail their save cannot take
reactions until the end of their next turn. Against
objects, this effect inflicts piercing damage instead
of poison.
The explosive noise of this spell can be heard up
to 100 feet away. The spell does not noticeably affect
the structure of any object that is the source of the
elemental effect, unless it is an object that is not
being worn or carried. If that is the case, the object
suffers the same 2d6 damage as a creature that
failed its saving throw.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a 2nd level or higher spell slot, the damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
