You point at a creature within range and make a
retching, gurgling sound, and it must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its lungs
start to fill with water, pouring out of the target's
mouth and nose. The target starts choking and may
not take bonus actions or reactions while their
lungs are full of water. The target may repeat the
Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its
turn, ending the spell on a successful save. If the
target fails three saving throws, it drops to 0 hit
points.
