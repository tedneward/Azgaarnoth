#### Bodak's Glare
*8th-level necromancy* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (the eyes of a lawful good paladin)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
As you chant your eyes vanish into swirling black
voids. You can choose one creature that you can see
within 30 feet that has less than 50 hit points and
force it to make a Constitution save. On a failure, it
is reduced to 0 hit points and must immediately
make its first death saving throw.
Anyone killed by this spell rises as a bodak 24
hours later (your DM has statistics for bodaks). If
the body has been destroyed or buried, the undead
god Orcus will create a new body for the bodak near
where it died. The bodak is not under your control.
In fact, a bodak you create in this way will likely
seek you out to take a long and bloody revenge
upon you.
