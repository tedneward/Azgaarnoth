You must not be wearing armor when you cast this
spell, otherwise the spell fails. You call forth
enchanted armor that protects you in a time of
need. This can be your choice of any kind of light
armor. If you are proficient with medium armor,
you can choose any kind of light or medium armor
with which you are proficienct. You instantly don
this armor as part of casting this spell. The armor is
magical, and in addition to the normal properties of
the type of armor you chose, it grants you a +1
magical bonus to Armor Class. Wielding a shield
does not interfere with this spell, but it ends if you
attempt to don other armor.
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level
or higher, the armor can be your choice of any kind
of heavy armor with which you are proficient, as
well as light or medium. When you cast this spell
using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the armor
magical bonus increases to +2, and you can
concentrate on the spell for up to 8 hours.
