creature in range, which must make a Dexterity
saving throw. The creature takes 2d10 magical
slashing damage on a failure, or half as much on a
success. On a failure, it also provokes an
opportunity attack from one or two creatures of
your choice within 5 feet of it.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
