You choose one creature within range and force
them to make a Wisdom saving throw. If they fail
they are filled with the uncontrollable desire to
drink. The creature will not knowingly drink poison
or any other liquid that is detrimental to them. The
target will use its action on its turn to drink any
potable liquid it possesses. If the creature doesn't
have any potable liquid in its possession, it will use
all its actions to try and find some. The target may
repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of their
turn to end the spell.
