- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You enter a state of complete instinct, temporarily
making your thoughts a blank and protecting
yourself against attempts to invade or control your
mind. You can reroll the failed saving throw that
triggered this spell, but must use the new roll, even
if it is lower. In addition, until the end of your next
turn, you have resistance against psychic damage.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a 3rd level spell slot, you cannot be charmed or
frightened until the end of your next turn. If you are
already charmed or frightened, then the condition
is suppressed until the end of your next turn. While
the condition is suppressed it doesn't function but
the time spent suppressed counts against its
duration.
