At your command, clouds gather and there is a
downpour of heavy rain. Everything within a 100-
foot tall, 100-foot wide cylinder centered on you is
lightly obscured, and creatures have disadvantage
on Wisdom (Perception) checks to perceive things
within the area, which becomes difficult terrain. All
open flames within the area are extinguished.
