When you cast this spell, sharp metallic blades
sprout from your body and all your gear. You are
proficient with the blades as light melee weapons
that inflict 1d6 + your Strength modifier piercing
damage. You can choose to attack with the blades
using an attack action, and can even attack with one
using each hand (following all normal rules for
wielding a light weapon in each hand).
In addition, for the duration, you can deal
damage when successfully grappling a creature.
Whenever you have a creature grappled at the end
of your turn, that creature takes piercing damage
equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.
Finally, you have advantage on all ability checks
or saving throws made to escape a grapple, and
whenever a creature tries to grapple you, it takes
piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength
modifier, whether they succeed or fail in their
grapple attempt.
