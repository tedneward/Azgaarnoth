You cast an illusorry version of one of the following

this as if the spellcaster had cast one of those spells,
with the following exceptions:
* Targets make a Charisma saving throw instead
of the normal saving throw for the imitated
spell.
* Instead of the normal damage for the imitated
spell, creatures who fail the Charisma saving
throw take 4d6 necrotic damage and 4d6
psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much
of each type of damage on a successful one.
* A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is
not killed, but is stable and unconscious at 0 hit
points. A creature that falls unconscious due to
damage from this spell can make a Wisdom
saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On
a success, it regains hit points equal to the
psychic damage this spell inflicted.
* A a creature that takes psychic damage from
this spell heals a number of hit points equal to
the psychic damage 1 minute after the damage
was taken, unless it already recovered those hit
points by making a successful Wisdom saving
throw against this spell, as described above.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, you deal an extra
1d6 psychic damage for every two spell levels above
4th. In addition, when you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 7th-level or higher, you deal an extra
