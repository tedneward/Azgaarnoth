Your body falls into an enchanted slumber and your
spirit ventures into the world. Your spirit is invisible
and has a fly speed of 100'. You can move through
creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain.
Your spirit cannot be paralyzed, petrified, grappled,
or restrained. You can see and hear as if you were
standing in the same location as your spirit. Your
spirit cannot attack or cast spells; it can just
observe. Creatures and spells that can detect
invisible or ethereal creatures can see your spirit.
When the spell ends, your spirit returns to your
body, and you wake up. If something attacks your
body while your spirit is absent, the spell ends.
