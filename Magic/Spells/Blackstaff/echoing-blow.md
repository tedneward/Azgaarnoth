As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make an unarmed strike or weapon attack
against one creature within range. On a hit, the
target suffers the attack's normal effects, and if the
target is concentrating on a spell when this attack
hits, the attack deals extra thunder damage equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier, which creates a
loud noise that can be heard up to 100 feet away. In
addition, if this attack causes the target to make a
Constitution saving throw to maintain
concentration on a spell, that saving throw is made
with disadvantage.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an
extra 1d6 thunder damage to the target (whether or
not it is concentrating on a spell). This extra
damage increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th
level.
