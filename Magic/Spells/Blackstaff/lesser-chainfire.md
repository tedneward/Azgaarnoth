#### Lesser Chainfire
*5th-level enchantment* (Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
A column of magical fire and light descends on your
enemy, then spreads out to not only burn other foes
physically, but burn away their ties to the ally you
targeted. Make a ranged spell attack against one
creature within range. On a hit, the target takes 3d8
radiant damage.
Whether the attack hits or misses, a column of
psychic fire consumes it and the creatures around it.
Each creature of your choice in a 10-foot-radius, 40-
foot-high cylinder centered on the target (including
the target) must make a Wisdom saving throw. A
creature takes 2d6 fire damage and 2d6 psychic
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
In addition, each creature besides the target who
fails the Wisdom saving throw becomes indifferent
towards the target and forgets the target ever
existed, as if its memories were altered by a modify
memory spell. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During
that time, the creatures take no action to cooperate
with the target and make no special effort to keep it
from harm. If it is in a position of authority, affected
creatures do not obey its orders. When the effect
ends, all affected creatures regain their normal
memories.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
5th.
