___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against a
target within range, otherwise the spell fails. On a
hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and
takes an additional 1d6 cold damage as it is
enveloped in a crust of frost until the start of your
next turn. If the target makes an attack roll before
then, it immediately takes an additional cold
damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability
modifier, and the spell ends.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial extra
damage dealt by the attack increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 1st.
