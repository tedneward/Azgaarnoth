*7th-level evocation* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a ruby and a sapphire)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A red crystal appears in front of you and streaks
toward your target. A split second later a blue
crystal appears and streaks toward the same target.
Once the red crystal reaches your target it explodes,
an instant later the blue crystal explodes at the
same place. Every creature within 20 feet of the
exploding crystals must make a Dexterity saving
throw. Because of the dual nature of the attack,
these Dexterity saves are made with disadvantage.
Targets take 4d8 fire and 4d8 cold damage on a
failed save, and half as much on a successful one.
This spell deals double damage to objects and
structures.
