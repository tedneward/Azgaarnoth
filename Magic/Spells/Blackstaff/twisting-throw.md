---
As part of the action of casting this spell, you must
make a thrown weapon attack against a creature
within range, or the spell fails. However, you do not
make an attack roll. Instead, choose one creature
you have seen in the past minute. Your weapon
alters its path to move towards that creature,
moving around corners if necessary and ignoring
three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is
within range and there is a path large enough for
the weapon to travel to the target, the target must
make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the target takes the attack's
normal damage and suffers its additional effects,
and you learn the target's current location. On a
successful save, the target takes half damage from
the attack but suffers no additional effects that
would normally be imposed on a hit, and you don't
learn its location.
