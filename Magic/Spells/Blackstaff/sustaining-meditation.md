---
You enter a heightened state of consciousness in
which you have complete awareness and control of
your body's natural processes. Until this spell ends,
you are able to heal yourself for a limited number of
hit points. You gain a pool of 20 hit points worth of
self-healing. As a bonus action on your turn, you
can draw self-healing from the pool to restore a
number of hit points to yourself, up to the
maximum amount remaining in your pool.
Once all the self-healing of the pool is expended,
it does not replenish unless you cast the spell again.
When this spell ends, any unused healing in the
pool is lost.
Alternatively, if you have at least 5 hit points
remaining in your self-healing pool, you can use a
bonus action to neutralize one poison affecting you,
or to cure yourself of one disease or one of the
following conditions: blinded, deafened, paralyzed,
or poisoned. When you do this, the spell ends
immediately.
In addition, for the duration of this spell, you
don't need to eat or sleep (though you still need to
finish a long rest to prepare spells or regain any
abilities that require a long rest) and whenever you
hold your breath, you can do so for five times as
long as normal. If you have at least 1 hit point
remaining in your self-healing pool, you have
advantage on saving throws against poison and
resistance to poison damage.
This spell ends when you finish a long rest, or
when you cast it again.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the pool of self-
healing it confers is increased by 5 hit points for
each slot level above 3rd.
