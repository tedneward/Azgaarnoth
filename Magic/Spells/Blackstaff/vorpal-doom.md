#### Vorpal Doom
*9th-level enchantment* (Cleric,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a slashing weapon)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the
spell fails. The weapon attack ignores resistance to
slashing damage. On a hit, the target suffers the
attack's normal effects and takes an extra 6d8
slashing damage from the hit. On a miss, the spell
ends.
If the initial attack hits, the weapon retains its
enchantment for the duration. Until the spell ends,
the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage, and once per turn, when you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to cause
that creature to take an extra 6d8 slashing damage
from the hit.
In addition, while this spell is active (including
during the initial attack), if you attack a creature
that has at least one head with the weapon and roll
a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the
creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive
without the lost head. A creature is immune to this
effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't
have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the
DM decides that the creature is too big for its head
to be cut off with this weapon.
