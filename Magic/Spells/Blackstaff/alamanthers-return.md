casting time of 1 action. As part of casting this spell,
you immediately cast the triggering spell as well,
changing the casting time to 1 reaction for this
casting. The spell is cast using the same level of
spell slot as the triggering casting, and any
metamagic options applied to it are applied tyo your
casting as well. The new spell originates from you,
just as if you had cast it normally, and any required
rolls (spell attacks, damage, saving throws, etc.)
