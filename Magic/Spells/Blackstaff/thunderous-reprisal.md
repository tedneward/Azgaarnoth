You blast your enemies away in a wave of thunder
and destruction. Each enemy within 30 feet of you
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the enemy takes 4d8 thunder damage, or half
as much damage on a successful save. In addition,
enemies that fail their saving throw are pushed 10
feet away from you and become deafened until the
end of your next turn.
The sound of the thunder can be heard up to 500
feet away (or farther with a successful Wisdom
(Perception) check as determined by your DM).
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the thunder
damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
4th.
