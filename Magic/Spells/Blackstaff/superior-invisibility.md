The creature you touch turns invisible, and its scent
and sound are masked for the spell's duration. Like
greater invisibility , the subject can attack and cast
spells without ending the spell. This spell also hides
the subject from blindsight, tremorsense, and any
other sense that would normally reveal a hidden
creature.
In addition, the subject of the spell is immune to
see invisibility , faerie fire , and similar spells for the
spell's duration.
