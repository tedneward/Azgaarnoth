*2nd-level enchantment* (Bard,Cleric)

When their comrade falls, you convince
beleaguered foes they would be wiser to surrender.
Roll 6d6 and add the results together, then make a
Charisma (Intimidation) check and add your result
to that total. The final total is how many hit points
of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within
range of you that are hostile to you are affected in
ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring
unconscious creatures and creatures that cannot see
or hear you).
Starting with the creature that has the lowest
current hit points, each creature affected by this
spell drops any weapons it is holding, and for the
duration it can take no action except the Dodge,
Disengage, or Dash actions. You can make any
creature affected by this spell indifferent about
creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward.
Subtract each creature's hit points from the total
before moving on to the creature with the next
lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must
be equal to or less than the remaining
total for that creature to be
affected. This spell ends
early on any target that is
attacked or harmed by a
spell, or that witnesses
any of its friends being
harmed. When the spell
ends, a target remains
indifferent unless the DM rules that
it becomes hostile again. Undead,
constructs, and creatures immune to
being frightened aren't affected by
this spell.
At Higher Levels.  When you
cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or
higher, roll an
additional 2d6 for
each slot
level above 2nd.
