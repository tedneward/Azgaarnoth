---
This spell permanently reinforces the strength and
durability of materials. Paper is much harder to
tear, wood is more durable, and glass is harder to
break.
You can touch and affect up to 50 cubic feet of
material each time you cast this spell. The material
becomes resilient if it was fragile, and its AC is
increased by 4. If a material is already resilient, it
doubles in hit points.
For example, if you touch a resilient section of
wooden wall that has 50 hit points, its AC would
improve from 15 to 19, and it would have 100 hit
points.
