#### Distracting Visions
*3rd-level enchantment* (Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a small cloth made of black silk)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You distract your enemies by opening their
perceptions to the fascinating qualities of the world
around them. Choose an area the size of a 40-foot
cube within range. All creatures of your choice
within the area must make a Wisdom saving throw
or they become distracted, studying the shapes of
the clouds, the texture of tree bark, the patterns
carved into a stone wall, the temperature and scent
of a breeze, and more.
For the duration, a creature that fails its saving
throw against this spell has disadvantage on
Wisdom (Insight or Perception), and Intelligence
(Investigation) checks, and on Constitution saving
throws to maintain concentration on spells. An
affected creature can make a new saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect
on it with a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the cube's size
increases by 10 feet for every two slot levels above
3rd.
