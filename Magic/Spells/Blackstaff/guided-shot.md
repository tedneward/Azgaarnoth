You utter a sound of determination as you aim your

next turn, your ranged weapon attacks don't suffer
disadvantage due to the weapon's range. This spell
doesn't extend a weapon's range beyond its normal
limitations.
In addition, your ranged weapon attacks ignore
up to three-quarters cover until the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the duration of
the spell increases by 1 round for every slot level
above 1st.
