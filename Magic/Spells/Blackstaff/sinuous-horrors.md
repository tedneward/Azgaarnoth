*4th-level transmutation* (Warlock)
___

- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
Your arms transform into snakes when you cast this
spell. On each of your turns, you can make two
melee spell attacks with the snakes, with a reach of
10 feet. On a hit, a target takes poison damage equal
to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Also, the
target must make a Constitution saving throw, or be
poisoned until the start of your next turn.
You cannot cast spells with somatic or material
components while this spell is active, and holding
things will be difficult at best. This spell cannot be
dismissed (though it can be dispelled). It lasts a full
minute regardless of the caster's wishes.
