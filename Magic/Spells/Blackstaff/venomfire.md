- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a long stream of flaming venom which
you wield like a whip. Make a melee spell attack
against a creature within your reach, which is
increased to 10 feet with this attack. On a hit, the
target takes 4d8 fire damage and it must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is
also poisoned until the start of your next turn. Until
the spell ends, you can make this attack again on
each of your turns as an action.
When a creature within 30 feet of you inflicts
poison damage or the poisoned condition on
another target, you can also make this attack as a
reaction against the poisoning creature. When you
make this attack as a reaction, the reach is increased
to 30 feet, and any remnants of the poison on the
creature's person become caustic if you hit, causing
it to take an additional 2d10 acid damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the fire damage
increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
