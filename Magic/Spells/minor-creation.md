- **Duration:** Special
---
You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range. This can be soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 2.5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form that you have seen before.

The duration depends on the object's material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.

Material | Duration
-------- | --------
Vegetable matter | 24 hours
Stone or crystal | 12 hours
Precious metals | 1 hour
Gems | 10 minutes
Adamantine or mithril | 1 minute

Using the material created by this spell as another spell's material component causes that spell to fail.
