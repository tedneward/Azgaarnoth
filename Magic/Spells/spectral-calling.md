Playing an eerie rhythm, you summon a ghastly spirit from the great beyond You choose the kind of spirit, which must be a fiend or undead of challenge rating 4 or lower that has the Incorporeal Movement trait, such as a banshee or a ghost. It appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The spirit disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. 

The spirit is initially unfriendly toward you and your companions. Roll initiative for the spirit, which has its own turns. It is under the Dungeon Master's control and acts according to its nature on each of its turns, which might result in its attacking you if it thinks it can prevail, or seeking your assistance with unfinished business in return for limited service. 

On each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal command to the spirit (no action required by you). The spirit obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with its desires. Otherwise, you must make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check contested by its Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check fails, the spirit becomes immune to your verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though it can still carry out your commands if it chooses. If your check succeeds, the spirit carries out your command -- such as "attack my enemies," "explore the room ahead," or "bear this message to the queen" -- until it completes the activity, at which point it returns to you to report having done so. 

If your concentration is broken and the spirit has become immune to your verbal commands, it doesn't disappear. Instead, the spirit acts in whatever manner it chooses for 3d6 minutes, and then it disappears. 

If you possess a piece from the corpse of an individual spirit and you either know its true name or are within 60 feet of where it originally died, you can summon that spirit if it is of the appropriate challenge rating plus 1, and you have advantage on Charisma checks made to command it. The specific spirit must have already been trapped in this plane as an apparition, such as a ghost bound by unfinished business or a banshee created by the new [create apparition](create-apparition.md) spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.
