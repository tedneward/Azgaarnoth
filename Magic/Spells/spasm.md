One creature that you can see within range must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target drops whatever it is holding and begins sneezing, coughing, retching, or seizing until the end of its next turn. It can't take actions or reactions during that time. If it was concentrating, its concentration is broken. 

Any creature that is immune to disease, poison, or exhaustion is also immune to this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one addiÂ­tional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
