*2nd-level conjuration* (ritual) (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 40 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

An invisible sphere with a 5-foot-radius springs into existence at a point you choose within range. You declare an order with which all objects in that area are sorted. You could order things by size, cost, weight, or any other numerical value you can think of. Any object not currently being worn or carried flies around the sphere until it settles in an orderly manner. Containers are treated as a single object; their contents are not part of the organization process and remain within their container.

***At Higher Levels***. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the sphereâ€™s radius increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
