---
A burst of energy disruptive to undead fills a 30-foot
radius sphere centered at a point you can see within
range. An undead creature caught within the burst
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature is destroyed. On a successful save,
the creature is slowed until the end of its next turn.
Undead with fewer than 6 Hit Dice have
disadvantage on the saving throw; undead with 10
or more hit dice have advantage on the saving
throw.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the hit dice
threshold for each saving throw tier is increased by 1
for every slot level above 7th.
