- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of a shattered crystal ball)

---
You show a target how important their life is to the
multiverse. It must make a Wisdom saving throw or
be stunned and fall prone. At the end of your next it
is no longer stunned, but it is still prone. At the
start of its next turn your target must make a
Wisdom saving throw or be overwhelmed by its
own insignificance, using all of its movement to get
as far away as possible from any creatures near it. A
creature that fails the save will only fight if forced to
defend itself. It can repeat the Wisdom saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
spell on a success.
