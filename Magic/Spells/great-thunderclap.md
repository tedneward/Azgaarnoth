A pealing thunderclap resonates from a point that
you can see within range. The thunderous boom is
audible for 500 feet, and each creature within 20
feet of the chosen point must make a Constitution
saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature is deafened for 1
minute, it is pushed 10 feet away from the center of
the blast, and it is knocked prone.
A deafened creature can make a new saving throw
at the end of its turn, and on a success, it isn't
deafened.
