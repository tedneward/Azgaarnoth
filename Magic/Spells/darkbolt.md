___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You summon one bolt of dark force that
immediately streaks toward a target you choose
within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the
target. On a hit, if the target is a living creature, it
takes 5d8 force damage, and it must make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
is stunned until the end of its next turn. If a target is
undead, then it doesn't take the force damage, but
it must make a Wisdom saving throw, or be
stunned until the end of its next turn.
At the start of each of your turns for the duration,
one more bolt of dark force appears. You can use an
action to make a ranged spell attack with the bolt at
a target you can see within range.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the force damage
increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
