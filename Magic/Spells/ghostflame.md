You extend your arms and release a swirling torrent of pure, lightless heat, visible only as a mirage-like shimmer in the air. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 7d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature has resistance to fire damage, that resistance does not apply to this spell.

The heat from this spell ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
