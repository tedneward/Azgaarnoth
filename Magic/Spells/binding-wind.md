You form a swirling band of wind that wraps around a Medium or smaller creature that you see, like a miniature tornado that exerts pressure inwards. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and must make a Strength saving throw whenever it ends its turn while this spell is active. The spell ends when the creature succeeds on its saving throw. If the creature gets hit by an attack, takes damage from an area effect, or is forcefully moved, the spell ends.
