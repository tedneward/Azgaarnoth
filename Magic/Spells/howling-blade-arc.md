- **Range:** Self (30-foot line)
- **Components:** V, M (a melee weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you swing a melee weapon. An arc of shearing wind is traced in the air by the weaponâ€™s path, and the arc launches outward, threatening creatures and objects in a 5-foot wide, 30-foot line. Every creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 slashing damage, and half damage on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you increase the damage by 1d6 for each slot level higher than 2nd.
