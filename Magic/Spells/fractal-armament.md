___

- **Range:** Touch 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 
---
You touch a weapon or shield and wrap it in a complex shifting illusion that appears to create duplicates of the object when wielded. The illusion is so powerful that it feels real and can even block and harm those who aren't able to disbelieve it. Creatures that don't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight, are not affected by the spell.

Until the spell ends, if the target is a weapon, it gains the following benefits: 

* Attacks made with the weapon have advantage and ignore cover, except against creatures that aren't affected by the spell If such an attack hits, it deals bonus bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage equal to the weapon's damage dice and type. 

* If it was nonmagical, it is magical for the duration. 

If the target is a shield, it gains the following benefits: 

* The wielder gains a +2 bonus to AC, and creatures that attack the wielder do so with disadvantage, except attackers that aren't affected by the spell.

* The wielder gains advantage on Dexterity saving throws caused by creatures unless those creatures aren't affected by the spell.

If the object can be used simultaneously as a shield and a weapon, the wielder must choose at the start of each of their turns whether to gain the benefits as shield or a weapon that round, but not both at the same time.
