Choose a point you can see within range inside a body of water. The portions of that body of water that fit inside a SO-foot cube centered on that point become highly acidic until the spell ends. Any creature that ends its turn within the area takes 7d4 acid damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature is blinded until the end of its next turn. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried also take damage at the end of each of your turns. 

While the spell lasts, your magic keeps the acid in the area from mingling with the surrounding water. When the spell ends, the acid returns to its original form as water. This does not alter the composition of the water.
