#### Sudden Stalagmite
*4th-level conjuration* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
A ten-foot tall, very sharp stalagmite erupts under
your target, who must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d8
piercing damage, and is restrained as the stalagmite
pierces its flesh. On a successful save, the target
takes half as much damage, but is not restrained,
and the spell ends. A creature restrained by this
spell cannot escape until it uses an action to free
itself by making a successful Strength saving throw,
or until another creature within 5 feet of it succeeds
on a Strength check against your spellcasting DC.
When the target is freed, it takes 2d6 piercing
damage, and the spell ends. If the target has not
escaped when the spell ends, the target is freed.
