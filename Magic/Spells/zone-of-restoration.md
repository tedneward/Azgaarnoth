# Zone of Restoration
*6th-level evocation* (Bard, Cleric, Druid)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

With an incantation of power, you create an area of healing magic in the shape of a 25-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose that you can see within range. The area is filled with dim light and glittering dust for the duration.

If a creature ends its turn in the area before the spell ends, you can choose to have it regain a number of hit points equal to 2d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. If it has already regained hit points from this casting of the spell it gains that many temporary hit points instead.

When the spell ends, all temporary hit points granted by this spell disappear, but up to ten creatures of your choice each regain hit points equal to the number of temporary hit points granted by this spell that it had when the spell ended.

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
