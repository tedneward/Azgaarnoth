# Blood Rage
*3rd-level enchantment* (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a pint of the caster's blood) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You choose a willing creature you can see within range and incite the blood within its veins with an unquenchable fury. Until the spell ends, the target deals an extra 1d4 damage to the target whenever it hits with a melee weapon attack.

Until the spell ends, each time the target takes damage, increase the extra damage one die step to a maximum of 1d12. You can also increase the extra damage one die step as an action.

If the target drops to 0 hit points before the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to incite a new willing creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase the extra damage by one die step to a maximum of 1d12 for every slot above 3rd.

**Blood Magic.** When you cast this spell, you must expend 3 hit dice plus an additional 1 hit dice for every slot above 3rd. At the end of the duration, gain one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A of the Player's Handbook). This level of exhaustion lasts until you finish a short rest.
