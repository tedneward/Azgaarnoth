#### Pummeling Drumbeat
*8th-level evocation* (Bard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drum, which you play during the casting of the spell)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Your allies' attacks fall like the beats of your drum, pummelling your foes. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If a creature that failed its saving throw is hit by an attack roll from one of your allies before the end of your next turn, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.

The sound of the drumming from this spell can be heard up to 300 feet away.
