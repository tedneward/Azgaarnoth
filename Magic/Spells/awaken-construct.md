___
- **Casting Time:** 8 hours
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (the brain of a humanoid that has been dead less than 24 hours, treated with 10,000 gp worth of alchemical reagents, with the brain being consumed by the spell)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You summon writhing tendrils of life-giving electricity that cover the brain in your hand, before dispersing the light into a nearby construct and bestowing intelligence upon it. After spending 8 hours treating the brain, touch a Large or smaller construct. The construct is awakened and gains Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 2d6 + 6 each.

The awakened construct is charmed by you and friendly to you and your companions, but is not under your control unless you control it by other means. It remains charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened construct chooses whether it will remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed.
