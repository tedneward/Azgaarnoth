#### Frost Beam
*6th-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (120-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You fire a continuous beam of blue-white light from your hand and turn the beamâ€™s angle to hit multiple targets, chilling and covering them in ice around the points of impact. You can make up to one ranged spell attack against each creature or object you can see within a 120-foot cone, as long as there is no creature or obstruction between you and the target. On a hit, a creature takes 6d6 cold damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained by ice until it succeeds on a DC 10 Strength check made as an action or the ice is destroyed. The ice has an AC of 12, 10 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire damage.

Alternatively, instead of making spell attacks in a cone, you can focus on a single creature or object within 120 feet with no creature or obstruction between you and the target, making two ranged spell attacks against the target with advantage. If the focused target is incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, or a stationary object, you automatically score a critical hit with one of the attacks.

A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you increase the damage by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.
