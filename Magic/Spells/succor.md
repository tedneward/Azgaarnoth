___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a platinum ring with a diamond worth at least 10,000gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You enchant a ring and choose a command word.
When the creature wearing the ring repeats the
command word, it is instantly teleported to the
nearest empty space to you. This spell fails if the
creature wearing the ring is not on the same plane
as you. Only one creature can be teleported by the
ring, but anything it is carrying comes with it.
