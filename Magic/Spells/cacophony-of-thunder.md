The air itself shimmers in disturbance as deafeningly loud rumblings fill a 50-foot cube centered on a point you can see. The affected area looks like a cube of slightly blurred atmosphere, shaking violently throughout its volume. From outside the cube, mufï¬‚ed explosions of noise can be heard, but inside the cube, creatures within are battered by thunderous clamor that shakes their very cores. When a creature enters or starts its turn within the cube, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it take 10d6 thunder damage and is deafened. On a successful save, it takes half damage and is deafened until the start of your next turn.

A creature that fails the initial saving throw must make a Constitution saving throw whenever it starts a turn. On a successful save, it is no longer deafened.
