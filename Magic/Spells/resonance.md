You cause nauseating sonic vibrations to pulse from a point of your choice within range. The sound fills a 60-foot radius sphere centered on that point for the duration. The area extends beyond total cover, and creatures within the area are deafened At the end of each of your turns until the spell ends, each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 8d8 thunder damage and it is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned 

While it is poisoned by this spelL a creature's speed is reduced by half and it is deafened. Each time it ends its turn outside the area, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, it is no longer poisoned.

The spell damages objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried if they are made of inorganic material such as stone, crystaL or metal It also deals maximum damage to creatures and objects made of such material.
