You counter an opponent's spell before it is even
cast, without knowing what spell you are
countering. When you cast this spell, the target
loses the ability to cast the highest-level spell it
knows (or has prepared, if it prepares spells) for the
duration. If the creature knows (or has prepared)
multiple spells of that level, the DM randomly
determines one of those spells. Until the spell ends,
the target cannot cast that spell by any means.
In addition, if the target uses spell slots to cast
spells, it loses one spell slot instantly when you cast
this spell. The lost spell slot is of the highest level
for which the creature currently has slots. After this
spell ends, the spell slot is regained.
If the target has 9th-level spell slots, or the spell it
would lose the ability to cast is 9th-level, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC
equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, this spell
works normally. On a failure, the target can make
an Intelligence saving throw to negate the effects of
this spell entirely.
This spell has no effect on creatures that cannot
cast spells.
