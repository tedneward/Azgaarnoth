You can speak 5 words which are magically
amplified so that every creature within a half a mile
can hear them. Deaf creatures cannot hear the
words. Sleeping creatures are automatically
awakened by the words. These words cannot be
used to perform an attack based on sound (a
banshee's wail, for example). Although, incredibly
loud, these words do not damage nearby creatures.
