---
You link your life force to a small item. A knife,
ring, or amulet is typical, but any item can be
chosen. While you remain healthy, the item
remains in perfect shape, never taking and wear or
tear. If it takes damage, it regains hit points
whenever you do, and in the same amount (so, if
you regain 8 hit points, the item also regains 8 hit
points), up to its normal maximum.
If you are killed or suffer the incapacitated,
paralyzed, petrified, stunned, or unconscious
conditions, the talisman becomes rusted and dull.
Once the condition is removed the talisman will
regain its luster. Damaging the item does not harm
you. These effects persist even if you and the item
are not on the same plane. This spell ends if you
cast it again.
