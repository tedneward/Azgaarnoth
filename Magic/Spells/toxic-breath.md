# Toxic Breath
*3rd-level conjuration* (Sorcerer; Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (30-foot cone)

**Components:** V, S, M (a lead ring or green dragon's scales)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You exhale a cloud of misty vapor in a 30 foot cone in front of you. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 8d6 poison damage, and it is poisoned until the start of your next turn. While poisoned in this way, its speed is reduced by half. On a success, a creature takes half damage and is not poisoned.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by ld6 for each slot level above 3rd.
