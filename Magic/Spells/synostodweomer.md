#### Synostodweomer
*7th-level transmutation* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
For the duration, you can turn another spell you
cast into healing energy. Instead of its normal
effect, the spell you cast is held until you touch
another creature before the duration expires; the
creature you touch regains 1d10 hit points per level
of the spell slot used to cast the triggering spell,
and then this spell ends.
For example, you could cast this spell, and while
you maintain concentration, you could cast mind
blank using an 8th-level spell slot, and before the
duration expires, you could touch a creature and
cause it to regain 8d10 hit points.
