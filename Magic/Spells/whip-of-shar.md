A whip of crackling black energy forms in your hand. The whip counts as a magical weapon with a reach of 10 feet with which you are proficient. 

As part of the action of casting this spell, and again on your turns for the spell's duration you can make a melee spell attack. A target struck takes 4d6 necrotic damage. Undead struck by the whip must make a Wisdom save in addition to the damage. If they fail they are frightened of you for 1 minute.

Undead frightened of you may repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of their turn to end the condition.
