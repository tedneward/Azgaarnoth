A bright streak ï¬‚ashes from your pointed finger, ending in a small explosion of freezing air. The explosion affects creatures and objects in a 5-foot radius sphere area centered upon a point you can see. Every creature in the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage on a failed save, and takes half damage on a successful save.

The air spreads around corners. It extinguishes nonmagical fires that it engulfs and freezes unattended liquids.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target an additional point you can see for every two slot levels above 1st.
