As you cast this spell, you plunge the short sword
into the side of your own body. You or any other
creature within 5 feet of you can end this spell
instantly by removing this short sword from your
side, which requires only a DC 5 Strength
(Atheltics) check. Until the spell ends, you take 1d6
magical piercing that cannot be reduced by any
means at the start of each of your turns, and you
cannot regain hit points, but you are immune to
nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage.
