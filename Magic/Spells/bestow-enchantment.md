#### Bestow Enchantment
*5th-level enchantment* (Artificer,Bard,Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Varies
---
When you use your action to cast a spell that has a range of self, you can immediately use your bonus action to cast this spell and touch one creature (this is an exception to the rule that you can only cast one non-cantrip spell each turn). That creature is affected by that spell instead of you, as if it were the source of the spell. You are still the caster of the spell, and if it requires concentration, you must maintain your concentration as normal for to keep the spell from ending. If the creature does not want the effects of the spell you are casting, it can make a Constitution saving throw against this effect. On a success, the spell fails.
