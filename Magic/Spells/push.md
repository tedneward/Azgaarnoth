#### Push
*1st-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A sudden wave of repulsive force erupts from your hand when you come into contact with a creature or unattended object. Make a melee spell attack against a creature or unattended object; on a hit, a creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 20 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. On a successful save, the creature is pushed 10 feet.

The amount of forced movement is halved for Huge creatures, and Gargantuan creatures are immune to this spell.

If the creature’s or object’s forced movement is interrupted by impact with an obstruction such as a wall, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it still had yet to be pushed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you increase the distance of the push by 10 feet for each slot level higher than 1st.
