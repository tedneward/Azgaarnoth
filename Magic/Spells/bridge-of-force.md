___

- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You produce a ﬂat plane bridge made of solid, translucent magical force leading across a direction of your choice, and starting from a space within 10 feet. The bridge is up to 20 feet wide, 200 feet long, and 1 foot thick. You can create it at an incline and choose to make any or all of its surface area into difficult terrain.

The bridge is fixed in space and does not need to connect with another structure to maintain its integrity. It can support any amount of weight while it exists.

The bridge is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by dispel magic. A disintegrate spell destroys the bridge instantly, however. The bridge also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the bridge.When the spell ends or is dismissed, the bridge disappears and anything on it falls.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a slot of 7th level or higher, then you increase the maximum length by 50 feet per level higher than 6th.
