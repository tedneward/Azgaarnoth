#### Ice Spike
*1st-level conjuration* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shard of glass)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You conjure an icy, 5-foot-tall stalagmite which erupts from the ground at a point you can see within range. This stalagmite is 3 feet wide at the base and tapers to a jagged point at the top.

A creature in the space when the spike appears must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 piercing damage and 2d6 cold damage and is knocked prone in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of the spike. On a successful save, the creature takes only half damage and is not knocked prone, but is still pushed out of the spike's space.

If there is no unoccupied space within 5 feet of the spike, the creature has disadvantage on the saving throw and the spike shatters and dissolves immediately after dealing its damage. Otherwise, the spike occupies the space it was conjured in until destroyed or melted by normal means.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the piercing damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
