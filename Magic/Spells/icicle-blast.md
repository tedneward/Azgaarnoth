You unleash a wave of cold that causes jagged ice crystals to rapidly form on surfaces in the area. The ground, walls, and other solid surfaces within the area become layered in ice for the duration.

Affected areas of the ground are difficult terrain, and any creature that falls prone on affected ground or is forcefully slammed into an affected surface takes 1d8 piercing damage (in addition to the damage from the fall or other effect).

Each creature on the ground in the area when you cast the spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 cold damage and falls prone (taking the piercing damage described above). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much cold damage and does not fall prone.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
