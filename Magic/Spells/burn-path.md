You temporarily close off a spellcasting foe's access
to a particular type of magic. Choose one creature
within range, which must make a Wisdom saving
throw. On a failure, you choose one school of
magical spell (abjuration, conjuration, divination,
etc.); for the duration, that creeature cannot cast
any spell from that school of magic. The target can
repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each
of its turns, ending the spell on a success. The spell
also ends early if the target would suffer the effects
of another burn path  spell.
