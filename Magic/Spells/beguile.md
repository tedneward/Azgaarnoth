**Duration:** 1 round

You point at a creature within range and suggest a short phrase of up to 5 words, forcing the target to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is forced to shout the nearest approximation to the proffered phrase that exists in their native tongue. If the creature fails its saving throw by 5 or more, it can take no other actions during this round.
