Your body briefly transforms, shattering into a
horde of insects to attack nearby creatures before
instantly reforming. Each creature within range,
other than you, must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw, taking 2d10 piercing damage on a failure, or
half as much on a success. If at least one creature
fails its saving throw, you gain resistance to
nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage until the end of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the piercing
damage increases by a 1d10 for each slot level above
first.
