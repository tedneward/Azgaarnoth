# Pyroclastic Cataclysm
*9th-level evocation* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 300 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a chunk of volcanic rock)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You evoke a massive fiery conflagration of titanic proportions; a roiling pyroclastic firestorm 60 feet in diameter. The forces involved buffet and crash into any creatures within the area, and the area within the firestorm is considered difficult terrain. When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 15d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

As a bonus action, you can move the conflagration 20 feet in any direction, including upwards or downwards.
