#### Lesser Water to Poison
*4th-level transmutation* (Artificer,Bard,Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a creature within 30 feet drinks
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a vessel of water or a beverage which is partially water, with which you make a toasting gesture to the target as you both drink)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Waiting for just the right moment, you transform
the water someone is drinking into deadly poison.
The quantity of water does not matter, just that the
target drinks more than a sip. It can also be a
beverage that is partially water (such as wine, beer,
or juice).
The creature who drinks makes a Constitution
saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned
for the duration, and they take 4d8 poison damage.
If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more,
its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. On a
success, the creature can choose to spit the water
out and take no damage, or continue to swallow it
and take half damage. If the creature failed its save,
at the start of each of the creature's turns before the
spell ends, it must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw or take 4d8 poison damage. On a successful
save, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can affect one
additional creature who is drinking at the same
time, and the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot
level above 4th.
