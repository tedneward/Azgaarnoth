---
You shout a verse from an ancient battle hymn to
spur an unexpected attack. Choose an ally within
range. That ally can use its reaction to make a melee
weapon attack against a hostile creature within its
reach. If no hostile creature is within reach, as part
of the same reaction, the ally can move up to 15 feet
closer to a hostile creature before making the
attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's
normal effects, and takes an additional 1d8 psychic
damage.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
6th.
