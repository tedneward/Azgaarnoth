#### Pool of Deeds
*4th-level divination* *(ritual)* (Bard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a mirror)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You enchant a body of water of any size and name a
creature. This can be a living or dead individual.
The creature you name, or their corpse, does not
have to be physically present. The most important
events of that creature's life will play out in the
water. The whole event will take about an hour.
You can also choose to view a specific story from
the target's life. You must have general knowledge
of the story, but you don't need to know specifics. If
you name a creature that does not want to have its
life events displayed, it can make a Charisma saving
throw to resist the spell. On a success, the pool
shows a series of random images.
