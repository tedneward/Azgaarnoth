A 20-ft. radius sphere of white light appears at a point of your choice you can see. The surface of the sphere is opaque from both the interior and the exterior. Inside the sphere, the illumination is uniform and as bright as an outdoor environment during daylight hours. The illumination inside the sphere is treated as sunlight. The sphere itself sheds bright light in a 40-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 40 feet.

If any of this spellâ€™s area within the sphere overlaps with darkness created by a spell of 5th level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.
