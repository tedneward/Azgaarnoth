# Acrid Delight
*1st-level transmutation* (ritual) (Bard, Druid, Pale Master, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of food)

**Duration:** Up to 1 hour

You touch a piece of food (weighing up to 5 lbs), rotting it from the inside, but maintaining its original taste, texture, appearance and smell. If the piece of food is then eaten by a creature within one hour, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 poison damage and become poisoned until it completes a long rest. On a successful save the creature takes half the damage and is not poisoned. If the food is not eaten within one hour, it succumbs to its rotten nature and spoils.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1st.
