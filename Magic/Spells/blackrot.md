As part of the action of casting this spell, you can choose to make a melee spell attack against one target within 5 feet of you. On a hit, your target takes 2d10 necrotic damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes an additional 2d10 necrotic damage at the start of your next turn.

If you choose not to make the melee spell attack, as part of the action of casting this spell you can choose one weapon you touch and coat it in a sticky, black poison. The next time a melee attack made with the weapon hits a living creature before the end of your next turn, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes an additional 2d8 poison damage at the start of your next turn.

Undead and constructs never take damage from this spell. However, when you damage a plant with this spell, you deal maximum damage instead of rolling.
