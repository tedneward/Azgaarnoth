You gather an orb of pure cold in your hand, concentrating for an instant before sending it cascading over your enemies, freezing your enemies down to the bone. Creature caught in the area of effect must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures take 20d6 cold damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. Enemies reduced to 0 hit points by this blast are turned to ice and instantly slain. A creature that dies in this way can only be returned to life by a [true resurrection](./true-resurrection.md) or [wish](./wish.md) spell, or divine intervention.
