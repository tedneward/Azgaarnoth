You play an enchanting lullaby that puts a creature
into a waking dream-like state, full of disturbing
and distracting sounds and images. You may target
up to six creatures of your choice within range who
can hear you. Each target must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or take 3d4 psychic damage
and be affected for the duration.
An affected creature has disadvantage on attack
rolls and cannot take reactions for the duration. A
creature affected by this spell makes another
Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a
successful save, the effect ends for it.
This spell has no effect on undead and constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.
