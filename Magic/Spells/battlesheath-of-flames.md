___

- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Flame sheathes your hand but does not burn you. If you are wielding a weapon in the sheathed hand, the ﬂame sheathes the weapon as well if you so desire. If you make a melee attack against a creature or object with the ﬂame-sheathed hand/weapon, you deal an additional 1d6 fire damage on a hit. When you deal the fire damage, the ﬂame is extinguished immediately afterwards, but you can re-sheathe your hand (and weapon) with a bonus action.

The sheathed hand/weapon emits bright light in a 20-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you increase the damage by 1d6 for every two slot levels higher than 1st.
