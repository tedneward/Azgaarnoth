As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects.

A target that is struck by this spell must roll a WIS save. If failed, the energy transferred to the target will immediately counteract Rage by inducing a state of calm. The target may not return to a state of rage until the end of the caster's next turn.
