#### Thought Harvest
*3rd-level divination* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piercing weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You pierce the mental defenses of one creature you
can see within range. The target must make a
Wisdom saving throw, taking 5d6 psychic damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. Also on a failed save, the target
cannot take reactions or the disengage action until
the end of your next turn, and it suffers
disadvantage on the next attack roll or saving throw
it makes before the end of your next turn. Finally,
when a target fails its saving throw against this
spell, you instantly know its surface thoughts, what
is most on its mind in that moment.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
3rd.
