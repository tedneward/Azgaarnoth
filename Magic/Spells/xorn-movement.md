#### Xorn Movement
*5th-level transmutation* (Druid,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a scale from a xorn's hide)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You or a creature you touch can travel through the
earth itself without leaving any mark of passage.
The target gains a [burrow speed](../../GameNotes.md#burrow) equal to its walking
speed. In addition, when burrowing through
nonmagical, unworked earth and stone, the target
leaves its hands free and doesn't disturb the
material it moves through. The recipient can extend
the magical aura of this spell to bring any object or
creature it is carrying or grappling as it burrows.
The target enjoys no special protections from this
effect except for the cover of the stone or earth
around it.

If this spell or its effects end on the target or any
other object or creature placed within stone or
earth by means of this spell, you or any such object
or creature are expelled from the earth, moving at
60 feet per round towards the nearest open space
large enough to fit into comfortably and taking 6d6
bludgeoning damage upon exiting into that space.
