Until the spell ends, heavy snow swirls through the air throughout a 50-foot-tall cylinder with a 100-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is lightly obscured, exposed flames inthe area are doused, and ranged attack rolls in the area have disadvantage. Thick snow coats the ground in the area, making it difficult terrain.

When the blizzard appears, each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. If a creature is flying when it fails this saving throw, the creature falls to the ground.

You are unaffected by this spell. Additionally, you may designate a number of other creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier to also be unaffected by this spell.
