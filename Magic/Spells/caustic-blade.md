As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee weapon attack against one
creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell
fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal
effects, and magically conjured acid traces the path
your weapon cut through the air.
If the target ends its next turn within 5 feet of one
or more other creatures you can see, you can inflict
acid damage equal to your spellcasting ability
modifier on your choice of one of those creatures.
Whether or not this happens, at the end of the
target's next turn, the spell ends.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. This spell's damage increases when
you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee
attack deals an extra 1d10 acid damage to the target,
and the acid damage to the second creature
increases to 1d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
Both damage rolls increase by 1d10 at 11th level and
17th level.
