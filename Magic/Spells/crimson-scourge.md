#### Crimson Scourge
*5th-level necromancy* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of vampire blood)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You choose one target with range, which must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure,
blood fills its eyes, seeps from its pores, and gushes
from its mouth and ears, dealing 10d8 necrotic
damage to the creature and blinding it for the
duration. On a success, a creature takes half as
much damage but suffers no other effects. A target
blinded by this spell can repeat the Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the spell on a success. This spell has no effects on
constructs, elementals, or undead, except for
vampires (including both vampire spawn and
vampire lords). Vampires make the initial
Constitution save versus this spell with
disadvantage.
