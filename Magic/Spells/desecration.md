# Desecration
*2nd-level abjuration* (Cleric, Paladin, Pale Master)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch (15-foot-radius circle)

**Components:** V, S, M (an unholy symbol, vial of unholy water and incense worth 20 gp, which is consumed)

**Duration:** 1 minute

Unholy energy spreads outwards from a point you touch on the ground to fill up to a 15-foot-radius circle for the duration. The energy spreads around corners. For the duration, an undead creature within the circle has advantage on Wisdom saving throws and skill checks. Additionally, if they begin their turn in the circle, they gain 2d6 temporary hit points. Creatures of your choosing suffer disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and skill checks while inside the area.

When the spell ends, the area is tainted by unholy energy and becomes desecrated ground. If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture devoted to a deity, pantheon, or higher power with ideals vastly different from those represented by the holy symbol used in the casting, it is destroyed.
