You choose any nonmagical writing you can see within range and it is magically copied onto blank paper you are holding. 

This spell copies 250 words per minute and creates a perfect duplicate of the original. It does not translate the text or make it clearer.

Illustrations or magical writings (such as the text of a spellbook, a spell scroll, or a glyph of warding) are not copied at all by this spell. If the original text contains both normal writing and magical writing or illustrations (such as a letter with a glyph of warding or a drawing in one corner), only the normal text is copied.

You must provide blank paper in some form for the spell to copy the text onto. If a blank sheet is filled with copied text, you must cast the spell again with a new blank sheet of paper to continue copying more text.
