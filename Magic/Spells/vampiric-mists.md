You create a 20-foot radius sphere of blood red mist
centered on a point you choose within range. The
mist spreads around corners and lasts for the
duration. A strong wind can disperse the fog,
ending the spell. The area is heavily obscured.
If a creature enters or starts its turn in the mist, it
must make a Constitution saving throw. They take
6d8 necrotic damage on a failed save and half as
much on a successful one. This spell affects
creatures that don't need to breathe, but has no
effect on undead or constructs. If a creature is
reduced to 0 hit points while in the mists, you heal
1d8 hit points. You may only heal damage from this
spell once a round.
The mists moves 10 feet away from you at the
start of your turn. The vapors are heavier than air
and sink to lowest level of the land.
At Higher Levels. You can cast this spell using a
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d8 for each spell level above 6th.
