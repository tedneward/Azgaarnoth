When you cast this spell, a
flash of magical energy
spreads out from you in a
120-foot radius. This spell
acts as a dispel magic  spell
cast using a 9th-level spell
slot targeting all objects
and structures within
range. Creatures within
range are also targeted,
but spells affected those
creatures are only
dispelled if they are
causing those creatures to
be charmed, paralyzed, or
stunned. The spell does
not restore or affect
creatures turned to stone,
or release bonded
creatures from service,
such as familiars, invisible stalkers, and genies.
Also, the spell does not penetrate or affect an
antimagic field  in any way. This spell does not affect
objects that are being worn or carried by a creature.
Finally, any traps attached to any objects affected
by this spell are triggered immediately the moment
spells affecting those objects are destroyed.
