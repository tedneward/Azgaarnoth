You softly weave preserving magic around one willing creature that you can see within range, causing it to enter a state resembling recent death. Until the spell ends, the target is unconscious. While unconscious in this way, it does not age and doesn't need food, drink, air, or sleep. It is also immune to poison and disease, although any poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

During the casting of the spelL you must specify a condition that will cause the spell to end, and the target must willingly agree to this condition before casting is finished, or else the spell fails. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and that it has some likelihood of eventually occurring. Some examples include a kiss from a prince, a serenade from an angel, or the fall of an ancient royal lineage. 

When the spell ends, if the target was unconscious for more than 12 hours, it gains the benefits of a long rest, all its hit dice are restored, and its exhaustion level is reduced by one for every 12 hours that the spell lasted.
