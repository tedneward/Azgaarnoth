# Wind Funnel
*4th-level transmutation* (Artificer, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (60-foot cone)

**Components:** V, S, M (an empty bottle with stopper)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a powerful torrent of swirling wind that pulls in a roaring cyclone toward you, creating a 60-foot cone emanating from you. Each other creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 3d8 thunder damage and 3d8 bludgeoning damage, and it is pulled 30 feet closer to you and knocked prone. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half damage and isn't pulled or knocked prone.

Unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pulled 30 feet closer to you by the spell's effect.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage dealt increases by ld8 and the distance a creature or object is pulled increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 4th.
