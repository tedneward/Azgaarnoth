A black streak ﬂashes from your pointed finger to a point you chose within range, and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of engulfing darkness. Every creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage and is necrotized until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage.The darkness affects illumination in the local environment brieﬂy, turning bright light into dim light and dim light into darkness in a radius of 80 feet from the sphere’s center until the start of your next turn. This is treated as magical darkness. If any of this spell’s area overlaps with light created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
