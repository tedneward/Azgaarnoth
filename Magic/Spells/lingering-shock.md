- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
Persistent strands of lightning curl around your hand and enter into a creature that you touch, spreading throughout its body. You make a melee spell attack against a Medium or smaller creature. The attack roll has advantage against a creature wearing metal armor. On a hit, the creature takes 1d8 lightning damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature grants advantage to attacks made against it, has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and canâ€™t take reactions until the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you increase the damage by 1d8 for each slot level higher than 1st and the maximum target size category by one step for every two slot levels higher than 1st.
