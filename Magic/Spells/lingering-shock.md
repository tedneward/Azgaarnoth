___

- **Range:** 90 feet

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You place an electric charge within a creature you 
can see within range. The target takes 2d8 lightning 
damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving 
throw or be stunned until the beginning of its next 
turn and be affected by the spell for the duration.

An affected creature repeats this process at the 
start of each of its turns. If the creature accumulates
three successful saving throws against the spell, the 
creature is no longer affected.
