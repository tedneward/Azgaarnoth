---
You cause one creature that you can see within range to hear otherworldly whispers proclaiming its own weakness. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 psychic damage, and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. The target automatically succeeds on the saving throw if it can't hear the caster.

The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
