#### Sympathetic Agony
*1st-level divination* (Bard,Paladin,Sorcerer)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a friendly creature besides you within 30 feet of you takes damage
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You share another creature's pain, taking part of its
burden upon yourself. Targeting the friendly
creature who would take the triggering damage, you
roll 1d10. You add your spellcasting ability modifier
to the number rolled, and reduce the triggering
damage to the target by that total. However, you
take psychic damage equal to the same total, which
cannot be reduced or redirected by any means.
Until the end of your next turn, you and the
target both gains a +2 bonus to AC and saving
throws while you are within 30 feet of each other,
and if you and the target share a language, you can
communicate telepathically with it as long as it is
within 30 feet.
