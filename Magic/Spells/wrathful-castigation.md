Choose a target you can see within range. The chosen creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or fall to the ground incapacitated, while writhing in pain. On a successful save, the spell ends.

A creature that starts its turn incapacitated by this spell must make a Wisdom saving throw as its mind is flooded with the thoughts of all its failures.

On a failed save, the creature remains incapacitated. However, if the creature fails its saving throw a total of three times before making a successful save, it dies in agony, overwhelmed by the compounding pressure of all its failures.
