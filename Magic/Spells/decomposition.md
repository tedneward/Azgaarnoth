#### Decomposition
*2nd-level necromancy* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
When you cast this spell, an aura of decay
surrounds you. For the duration, whenever a hostile
creature within range takes damage, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw,
it suffers a festering wound. This wound inflicts 5
necrotic damage on the creature at the start of each
of its turns.
A creature suffering from a festering wound can
make a new Constitution saving throw at the end of
each of its turns. A successful saving throw stops
the ongoing necrotic damage from that wound and
causes the creature to be immune to the effects of
this spell for 1 minute. A creature can suffer from
only one festering wound at a time.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of
necrotic damage increases by 5 for each slot level
above 2nd.
