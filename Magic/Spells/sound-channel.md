You audibly connect a 10-foot cube space that you are currently occupying with another 10-foot cube space you can see. Creatures can freely transmit sounds between the two spaces as if the spaces were adjacent, effectively facilitating verbal communication between creatures at both spaces. If harmful sounds or vibrations would be transmitted between the spaces, the transmission fails and the spell ends.
