Your victim must make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature collapses in pain. Boils
and blisters appear all over its skin and then pop,
covering it with vile fluids as its eyes fill with blood,
causing the victim to be paralyzed and blinded until
the spell ends.

The victim can attempt a Constitution saving
throw at the end of each of its turns. If it succeeds,
the spell ends. Even after the spell ends, the victim
has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks
until it finishes a short or long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration
increases to concentration, up to 1 hour for a 6th or
7th level spell slot, or concentration, up to 1 day for
an 8th level or higher spell slot.
