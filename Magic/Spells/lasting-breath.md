#### Lasting Breath
*8th-level evocation* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of dragon saliva)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You unleash a breath weapon like that of a dragon,
which then hangs in place and draws your enemies'
attention. You choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or
poison for this spell, and force each creature in a
60-foot cone to make a Dexterity saving throw. A
creature takes 6d6 damage of the type you chose on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
The cone lingers until the spell ends, and its
area is lightly obscured. Any creature that enters the
spell's area or starts its turn there must make a
Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 damage of the
type you chose on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
A creature that fails its saving throw also feels
compelled to end the source of the breath weapon,
giving it disadvantage on attack rolls against
creatures other than you for the rest of that turn.
