# Grimlore's Shadowgrasp
*2nd-level necromancy* (Pale Master, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a floating hand made of shadow in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the shadowy hand. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 of necrotic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn.

As a bonus action, you can move the shadowy hand up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage dealt by the hand increases by 1d12 for every two spell slot levels above 2nd.
