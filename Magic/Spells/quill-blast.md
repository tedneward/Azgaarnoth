#### Quill Blast
*5th-level conjuration* (Druid,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a porcupine's quill)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Needle-sharp quills emerge from your skin, flying outward in every direction. All creatures in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes piercing damage from the quills. The amount of damage depends on a creature's size as shown on the table below. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half the listed damage.

Size | Piercing Damage
---- | ---------------
Tiny | 2d6
Small | 4d6
Medium | 6d6
Large | 8d6
Huge | 10d6
Gargantuan | 12d6

Unless a creature is an undead or a construct, on a failed saving throw it has disadvantage on all its saving throws and ability checks until the end of your next turn as it writhes in pain.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 5th. If the spell slot used is 7th level or higher, the dice rolled for damage become d10s instead of d6s.
