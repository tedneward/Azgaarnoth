Your targets stand perfectly still for a moment, then
fold into themselves with a disgusting SPLURCH!
Choose four targets within range. Each target must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
a target's Constitution score is reduced by 4d6. If a
creature's Constitution is reduced to 0 in this way, it
twists into a bloody sack of torn muscle and cracked
bone, and dies. A creature that fails its saving
throw, but survives the reduction of its
Constitution, is poisoned until it finishes a long
rest. Such a creature regains its normal Constitution
score when it completes a long rest.
If a target succeeds on the Constitution saving
throw, it suffers no ill effects.
