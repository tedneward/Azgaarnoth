A whip of flame extends from one of your hands. 

The whip is a melee weapon with a reach of 10 feet, with which you are considered proficient. It sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. As part of the action of casting this spell, and again as an action on each of your turns for the spell's duration, you can make a melee spell attack with the whip, dealing fire damage on a hit equal to 3d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
