As part of the action used to cast this spell you must make a ranged attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. A spirit of predator beasts guides your strike. You have advantage on the attack roll and for this attack, your weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and the attack deals 4d8 bonus poison damage. 

Then, hit or miss, your attack conjures a fey hunting spirit taking the form of a beast and appearing in a space adjacent to the target. The beast is challenge rating 2 or lower, and as a spirit, it gains extra traits in addition to its normal statistics. 

* Its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are each raised to 10 if that score is normally lower than 10. This doesn't confer any additional languages. 
* It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by nonmagical weapons. 
* It has advantage on attacks made against the target. 
* It can move through other creature's spaces and end its turn there. 

The beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to O hit points or when the spell ends. 

The beast is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the beast--it has its own turns. If the target is still alive, the beast ignores your commands; it will decide how to take its own turns with no goal other than the death of the target. Once the target dies, the beast obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions if the target is dead.
