failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. In addition, its hit point maximum is reduced
by the amount of damage it takes. After a long rest,
the target's hit point maximum returns to normal.

a 5th level or higher spell slot, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
