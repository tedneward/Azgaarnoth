You enchant your imbued weapon to inflict vicious wounds upon striking. Your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If a creature suffers a critical hit from your imbued weapon, until the spell ends, each time the creature is struck by the weapon it must make a successful Constitution saving throw, or take an additional 1d6 damage of the same type as the weapon.
