# Lesser Charm of Second Chance
*2nd-level divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you make a saving throw, ability check, or attack roll

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a weighted die)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Pulling at the thread of the Weave, you subtly shape events. After rolling a die for the triggering event, you can use your reaction to reroll it, but you must accept the new result.
