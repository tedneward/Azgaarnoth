---
You demand that your foes meet you in battle, then
strike fiercely against one of them. Choose any
number of hostile creatures within range of this
spell. You may pull each target up to 30 feet closer
to you. At the end of this movement, you can make
a melee weapon attack against one creature within
the reach of your melee weapon. If the attack hits, it
deals an extra 3d6 psychic damage, and creature
you hit has disadvantage on the next attack roll it
makes against any creature other than you before
the end of its next turn.
