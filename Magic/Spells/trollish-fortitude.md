- **Components:** V, S, M (pieces of a troll's heart)

---
For the duration of the spell, you regain hit points
equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the
beginning of your turn. If a limb or your head is cut
off, you may reattach them by using an action to
hold it up to the stump. If your head is severed
while under the effects of this spell you will be able
to see using your own eyes, but coordination will be
difficult. Yoou have disadvantage on all Dexterity saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks until
you reattach your head. If you have taken fire or
acid damage since your previous turn, you will not
regain hit points this round. If you have not
reattached a severed limb and the spell ends, you
cannot reattach the limb. If the head is separated
from your body when the spell ends, you die.
