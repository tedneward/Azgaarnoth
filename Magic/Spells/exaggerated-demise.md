You create a hypnotic scene of your own death as the real you becomes invisible. You can depict your death and your corpse in any manner that you desire. Each creature of your choice within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or else become charmed until the end of its next turn. While charmed in this way, it can't move and is incapacitated A creature that can't see you when you cast the spelL that can see through illusions, as with truesight, or that doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight, automatically succeeds on the save. 

The illusion of your corpse lasts until the spell ends. Physical interaction with the corpse reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the corpse can determine that it is only an illusion if it succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. Once a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the illusory corpse as if it were partially transparent until the spell ends. 

You remain invisible until the spell ends or until you attack or cast a spell.
