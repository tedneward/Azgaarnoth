---
When you cast this spell, your eyes transform into dimly lit gray orbs that can petrify your foes. For the duration, at the end of each of your turns, you can force any creature within 30 feet of you who can see you to make a Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is restrained and must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of its next turn.

If the second saving throw is successful, the effect on the creature ends. If the creature fails the second saving throw, it is petrified until a [greater restoration](./greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic frees it.

If a creature fails the initial saving throw by 5 or more, it is immediately petrified as described above.
