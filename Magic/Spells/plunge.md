#### Plunge
*5th-level illusion* (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 150 feet 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** 1 round 
---
Choose up to 6 creatures that you can see within range. You fabricate a vivid illusion that shows your magic breaking the ground in under the targets, complete with every sensation of a sudden horrible fall to the death, though it only lasts a moment or two. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. 

On a failed saving throw, a target takes 6d10 psychic damage, falls prone, and cannot take reactions until the end of your next turn. On a successful saving throw, a target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects from the spell.

Creatures that can't be frightened have advantage on the saving throw and resistance to the spell's damage. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can choose an additional target for each slot level above 5th.
