# Earthen Grip
*1st-level transmutation* (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You target one creature you can see within range, causing them to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save the target is restrained by dirt rising from the ground in the shape of a fist.

The target may use its action to make a Strength saving throw, breaking free from the earth's grasp on a successful save.
