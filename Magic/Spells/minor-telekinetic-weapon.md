#### Minor Telekinetic Weapon
*Conjuration cantrip* *(brandish, psionic)* (Artificer,Sorcerer)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You manifest a simple melee weapon or a short sword, made of pure psionic energy. It appears in your free hand, ready to be wielded, and lasts for the duration. If you let go of the weapon, if you dismiss it (no action required), or if you are incapacitated, your telekinetic weapon disappears and this spell ends. Otherwise, it lasts until the end of your next turn.

You can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using this weapon, and it inflicts force damage instead of the normal damage for a weapon of that type.

As part of the action of casting this spell, you can make one melee attack with the weapon against a creature within 5 feet of you. If you do so, for that first attack only, the weapon inflicts an extra 1d4 force damage. After that, you attack with the weapon normally.

Though it is no more delicate than a common version of the weapon you have created, your minor telekinetic weapon manifests as a semi-transparent solid the same color as your eyes. This weapon has the simplest possible geometric shape it can have while still functioning as the chosen type of weapon, and creatures who see it know it is a magical effect you have created. 

At the end of the spell's duration, the weapon dissipates harmlessly.

This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the extra force damage you inflict when you make an attack with the weapon as part of the action of casting this spell increases by 1d4. This damage roll increases by an additional 1d4 at 11th level and 17th level.
