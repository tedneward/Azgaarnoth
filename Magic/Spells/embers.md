# Embers
*4th-level evocation* (Bard, Druid, Pale Master, Shaman, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause tiny burning embers to fall from the sky around you inside a 60-foot-tall cylinder with a 30-foot radius centered on yourself. When you cast the spell, you must choose if you intend for the embers to help or hinder. 

* **Help:** The embers provide restorative powers to all creatures that you choose within the area. A creature that has 0 hit points gains advantage on death saving throws until it completes a short rest or dies, whichever happens first. A creatures that is has 1 hit point or more gains 3d6 temporary hit points.

* **Hinder:** The embers work to oppress your foes. All creatures that you choose within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 fire damage and has its movement speed halved until the end of their next turn. It takes half damage and its move speed is unaffected on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the die increases by 1d6 on either effect for every slot level above 4th.
