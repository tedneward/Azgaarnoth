As a bonus action, you are able to manipulate the shadow belonging to a creature of Medium size or smaller that you can see within range. This manipulation can take several forms, such as making it act out simple actions independent from its owner, move up to 30 feet away from its owner, or to alter its shape one size larger or smaller than its owner. 

You may only manipulate one shadow at a time with this spell. Should the source of the shadow move from its original location, the shadow will follow its owner but remain under your control for up to the duration while within a range of 120 feet.
