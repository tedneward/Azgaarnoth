#### Ash Cloud
*2nd-level conjuration* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of soot)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of swirling 
smoke, soot, ash, and embers. The cloud spreads 
around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. The 
cloud lingers in the area for the duration.

A creature which enters the cloud for the first 
time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a 
Constitution saving throw or be affected by the 
spell. An affected creature's eyes water and sting 
from the hot embers, giving it disadvantage on 
attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that 
rely on sight. Whenever an affected creature ends its
turn outside the cloud, that creature can repeat the 
saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a 
success.

A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) 
disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at 
least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, an affected creature 
is also blinded.
