You drive an intelligent creature around you into a frenzied rage. Choose one creature within range, which must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target gains temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability score + the level of the spell slot used to cast this spell, and it is temporarily overwhelmed by an unreasoning battle fury.

While berserk, the target has the following traits:

* It has advantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and melee weapon attacks.
* When it makes a melee weapon attack using Strength, on a hit it adds your proficiency bonus to the damage.
* It gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* It is unable to cast or concentrate on spells.
* Attack rolls against it have advantage.

In addition, at the beginning of their turn, if the creature has no creatures within reach, it must move towards the nearest creature and attack it. Otherwise, the target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself. If, after moving at its full speed towards the nearest creature, the target still has no creatures within reach, it uses the Dash action to move towards the nearest creature. If it cannot do so, it attacks an object within range, which may be the ground or a wall. Whenever there are multiple creatures equally close to the target, the DM randomly chooses which one it moves towards or attacks.

At the end of each of its turns, if the target has made a melee attack since the end of its previous turn, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. It also ends early if the target is incapacitated.
