You must not yet have moved this turn, otherwise
the spell fails. Stepping through invisible folds in
the borders between planes, you teleport up to 10
feet to an unoccupied space that you can see, and
your speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the turn.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, your speed after
teleporting is halved instead of being reduced to 0,
and the distance you can teleport is increased by 20
feet for each slot level above 1st.
