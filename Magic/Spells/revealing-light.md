#### Revealing Light
*4th-level evocation* *(ritual)* (Bard, Cleric, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a portable light source)
- **Duration:** Special
---
You temporarily empower a portable, nonmagical light source (such as a torch, candle, or lantern) that you are holding. The spell lasts until the light source is extinguished, or 8 hours have passed, whichever happens sooner. For the duration, the light source brightens, adding an additional 10 feet of bright light and additional 10 feet of dim light to its illumination radius. All invisible creatures entering or within the sourceâ€™s enhanced light are made visible until they exit the area illuminated by the light source. Invisible objects, structures, and markings are also made visible. Illusory creatures, objects, and environments within the enhanced light will glow faintly, revealing them to be illusions.

When you cast this spell as a ritual, you must add powdered silver worth at least 1 gp as a material component, sprinkled over the light source and consumed in the casting.
