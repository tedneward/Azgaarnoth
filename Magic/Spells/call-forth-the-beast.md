- **Range:** 50 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (the eyes of a werewolf)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Choose a target within range, which must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the next time the target falls asleep, it awakens 30 minutes later mad with rage, immediately moving towards the nearest creature that moves and making a melee attack against it. While enraged by this spell, target does not cast spells or make ranged attacks, but is compelled to continue making melee attacks against its target.

This mad rage continues for 1 minute, during which time it continues to attack its target relentlessly. It only willingly stops if the target creature is dead or somehow completely removed from the situation, in which case it chooses the nearest creature that moves as its new target and attacks it in the same way. The creature enraged by this spell can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success. Otherwise, the spell ends 1 minute after the creature awoke in its rage.

When this spell ends, the target falls unconscious and goes back to sleep. Unless awakened, it sleeps for whatever length of time it would normally sleep. The target retains no memory of what happened while it was ensorcelled by this spell.
