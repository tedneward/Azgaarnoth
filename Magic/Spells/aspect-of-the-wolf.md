You transform into a wolf. The spell lasts for the duration, or until you choose to end it, or until your wolf form drops to 0 hit points.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of a wolf, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of a wolf.

* When you transform, you assume the wolf's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.

* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of a wolf. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as [call lightning](./call-lightning.md), that you've already cast.

* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the wolf form is physically capable of doing so.

* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your wolf form, or is worn by it. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the wolf form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. You can't activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of your equipment that merges with your wolf form until you leave wolf form.
