---
As part of the casting of this spell, you make a ranged weapon attack with an unloaded bow or crossbow. As you aim the weapon, you create an arrow or bolt of solid magical force that is loaded to the weapon before you make the attack. If the attack is interrupted, the ammunition disappears and the spell is wasted.The ammunition deals the same damage die and damage type as the standard nonmagical ammunition, except the arrows and bolts created by this spell are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity.

If you miss on the attack, choose a point you can see within 10 feet of the target. Every creature within 20 feet of the target (on a hit, including the target) or the designated point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 force damage and is pushed 10 feet. On a successful save a creature takes half damage. Huge creatures are only pushed 5 feet, and Gargantuan creatures are not pushed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you increase the force damage by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
