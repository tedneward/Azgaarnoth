You point towards a point you can see. A high frequency boom that most humanoids can’t hear erupts from the point, causing deafness and dizziness for a brief few moments. Every creature within a 20-foot radius sphere centered on the point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is deafened, grants advantage to attacks made against it, has disadvantage on attack rolls, Dexterity saving throws, and Dexterity checks until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature is deafened until the start of your next turn. Creatures stunned by this spell are no longer stunned if they take damage from an attack or area effect.

Creatures resistant or immune to thunder damage are immune to this spell’s effects. Creatures vulnerable to thunder damage have disadvantage on the saving throw.

Huge creatures have advantage on the saving throw. Gargantuan creatures are not unaffected by this spell.

Certain beasts such as cats and dogs will be able to hear the noise from the spell.
