You touch a creature and imbue it with the ability
to wield one set of tools with which you are already
proficient. For the duration, the target can always
add its proficiency bonus to any ability checks it
makes with the chosen set of tools, whether it is
actually proficient or not.
Alternatively, if you choose yourself as a target
while touching a creature that is proficient with a
set of tools that you aren't proficient with, you gain
proficiency with the chosen set of tools for the
duration.
