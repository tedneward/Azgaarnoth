# Scornful Mantle of the Undaunted
*8th-level abjuration* (Bard, Cleric, Pale Master)

**Casting Time:** 8 hours

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a ruby worth 1,000 gp)

**Duration:** Up to 1 minute

You touch a willing creature and strengthen its resolve, allowing it to become dauntless in the face of untold danger. For the duration, the target becomes immune to all conditions. If the target is currently affected with any condition other than exhaustion or is unconscious, casting this spell will remove those conditions from the target. Additionally, if a single source of damage would kill the target while the spell is active, the target's health is set to 1 hit point instead, and the spell ends.
