A pulsating vibration is emitted from your hand, which transmits disruptive rhythms that can cause disorientation in creatures. Make a melee spell attack against a Large or smaller creature. On a hit, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target grants advantage to attacks made against it, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, Strength checks, Dexterity checks, Strength saving throws, and Dexterity saving throws until the end of your next turn.

If the creature takes damage from an attack or area effect, the conditions applied by this spell immediately end.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can affect a Huge creature. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can affect a Gargantuan creature.
