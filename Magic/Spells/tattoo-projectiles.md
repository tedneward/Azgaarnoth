When you cast this spell, your skin appears to be
etched by glowing needles that manifest around
your person for a few seconds before vanishing,
leaving your limbs and/or torso with colorfully
stylized tattoos of darts, daggers, or throwing stars.
You have six of these phantasmal tattoos, which
remain on your skin for the duration of the spell.
and as a bonus action on each of your turns
tattooed weapons, appearing to snatch them off
your skin and hurl them with deadly accuracy
toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet
of you. As one of these phantasmal tattoo weapons
reaches its destination, it multiplies, becoming a
swarm of razor-sharp missiles. Each creature within
5 feet of the point you chose must make a Wisdom
saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 psychic damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
A tattoo projectile vanishes when you expend it,
decreasing your total number of tattoo projectiles.
When you use up all your tattoo projectiles, this
spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of
phantasmal throwing star tattoos created increases
by two for each slot level above 3rd.
