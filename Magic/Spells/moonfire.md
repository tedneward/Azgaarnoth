A 60-foot cone of moonfire emanates from your
outstretched hand. A creature caught in the cone
must make a Constitution saving throw or take 10d8
radiant damage and it is blinded until the start of
your next turn. On a successful save, a creature
takes half the damage and isn't blinded. A
shapechanger or an undead caught in the cone has
disadvantage on the saving throw.
In addition, all creatures and objects caught in
the cone that are either affected by spells or imbued
with magic glow with a faint blue light for 1 minute.
A shape-changed or polymorphed creature that
misses its saving throw returns to its original form.
