___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Up to 10 minutes
---
For the duration, you sense the presence of any undead creature within 30 feet of you. If you sense undead in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around the creature, even if incorporeal or in darkness (normal or magical). In addition, you are able to sense if the undead is controlled by a master, and if so, if its master is within 1 mile of your location and know their general direction.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
