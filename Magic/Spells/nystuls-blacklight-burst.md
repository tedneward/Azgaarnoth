___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a dagger with an onyx blade)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You reach into the Shadowfell and blast your
enemies with the essence of shadow. Choose a point
within range and every creature within 20 feet of
that point must make a Wisdom saving throw.
Creatures take 12d6 necrotic damage if they fail the
save and half as much if they successfully save. This
spell is hard to control, and is infamous for hurting
its caster almost as much as its enemies. Once you
have cast this spell, make a Wisdom saving throw
against your own spell save DC. If you fail, you take
half the damage inflicted by the spell. This damage
bypasses resistance and immunity. If you succeed
you maintain control of the spell and take no
damage.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you inflict 1d6
extra damage for every level above 4th.
