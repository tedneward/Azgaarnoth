You imbue an inanimate object you touch with an electrical charge. The first creature besides you who touches the object must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Once the charge is expended, the spell ends. Once you have cast this spell, you must complete a short rest before you can cast it again.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the lightning damage increases by 1d10 for every slot level above 2nd.
