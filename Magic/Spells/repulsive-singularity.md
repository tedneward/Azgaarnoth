A bright streak ﬂashes from your pointed finger, ending in the appearance of a tiny, intangible, bright-blue orb at a space of your choice you can see. Telekinetic forces suddenly push away at every creature and object within 30 feet of the orb, repelling them away from the orb. Every creature in the affected area weighing less than 500 lb. must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or be pushed 15 feet away from the orb, and every time it starts a turn within the affected area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away from the orb. A creature attempting to move towards the orb must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check every time it tries to move 5 feet towards the orb.

Unattended, unsecured objects weighing less than 500 lb. will immediately ﬂy away from the orb (creatures in the way might have to make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking improvised damage from ﬂying objects). Heavier objects may move according to the DM’s discretion. [Suggested damage: 2d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from Medium and smaller objects, 4d6 from Large objects, 6d6 from Huge objects, 8d6 from Gargantuan objects]
