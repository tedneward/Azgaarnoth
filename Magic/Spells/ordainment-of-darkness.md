Your body transforms entirely into magical darkness for the duration, granting you the following benefits: 

* You are immune to necrotic damage and you have resistance to all damage except radiant damage. 
* You ignore the effects of disease, exhaustion, and poisons. Any poisons or diseases already in your system are suspended, not neutralized.
* You cannot be grappled or restrained 
* You are invisible while fully within darkness. 
* You can see normally in darkness and dim light, even in magical darkness, out to a range of 120 feet. 
* You can use an action on your turn to expand your darkness like a cloud, creating a sphere of magical darkness that spreads beyond walls and obstacles, remains centered on you, and moves with you. You choose the radius of the sphere, which can't be more than 30 feet. No sound can be created within or pass through the darkness, except for sound you create. You can use another action on your turn to change the size of the darkness or make it disappear. 
* When a spell that you cast deals necrotic damage, it ignores resistance to necrotic damage, and it deals extra necrotic damage equal to 10 + twice the spell's level. A spell can't deal this extra damage to any creature more than once per tum.
