# Pure Flame
*1st-level evocation* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You conjure a flame, tinged with holy energy, and apply it to a wound. The target creature regains 1d4 hit points and if suffering from the effects of disease or poison due to failing a saving throw, the target creature can immediately make a new saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

This is a painful treatment option, however, and the affected creature makes attack rolls and skill checks at disadvantage on its turn.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.
