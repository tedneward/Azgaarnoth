You imbue a 20-foot radius sphere within range
with negative energy. Any undead in this area have
advantage on their saving throws. If the area
includes an altar to your god, or a desecrated altar
to an enemy god, then any undead in the area also
gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing damage. If an undead
creature is animated, created, conjured, or
summoned in the area, it gains temporary hit points
equal to its Hit Dice as soon as it appears.
