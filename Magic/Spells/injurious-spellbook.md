You transmute the two pages of your spellbook that contain the scripture for this spell to detach from the book's binding and develop razor-sharp edges. Both pages fly out and slice a creature in range, before safely returning to your spellbook and rebinding to their original location. Choose one creature within range or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. For each page, a creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 slashing damage.

***At Higher Levels.***When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 per page (2d8 total) for every two spell slots level above 1st.
