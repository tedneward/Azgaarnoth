As you wield your weapon in a sweeping strike, it
whispers menacingly, filling your foes' minds with
despair. Choose any number of creatures you can
see within range. Make a melee spell attack against
each target. On hit, a target takes psychic damage
equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier
and suffers disadvantage on the next saving throw
it makes before the end of your next turn.
