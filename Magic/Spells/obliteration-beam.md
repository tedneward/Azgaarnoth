*9th-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 500 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 800gp)

**Duration:** 1 round

You emit a massive beam of bright, powerful energy in a line 500 feet long and 25 feet wide that blasts away all in its deadly path. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11d10 radiant damage and 11d10 force damage, is pushed 50 feet away from you, and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed or knocked prone.

Until the end of your next tum, the area emits bright light for 500 feet and dim light for an additional 500 feet.

The spell damages and pushes objects in the area.
