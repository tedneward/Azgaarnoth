#### Petrifying Ray
*6th-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A ray of indigo light is shot from your pointed finger. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see. If the creature is hit, it must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature is restrained on a failed save, and must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns. Three successful saves end the spell. Three failed saves result in the target turning to stone permanently and being subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures donâ€™t need to be consecutive.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you produce an additional ray. Each ray can target the same or different targets.
