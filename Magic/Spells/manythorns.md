drain the blood and warmth from others, digging
into them after a few seconds of contact. A creature
that you grapple or is grappled by you takes 1d6
piercing damage at the start of your turn. On your
turn you may use an action to make a melee attack
against the creature. If you hit, you inflict 1d6 plus
your Strength modifier piercing damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** You can cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher. If you use a 3rd level
slot the damage dice (both the beginning of turn
and the melee attack) become 2d6. If you use a 5th
level spell slot the damage dice becomes 4d6. If you use a 7th level spell slot the damage dice becomes
8d6.
