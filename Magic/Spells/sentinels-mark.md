---
You choose a creature you can see within range and mark it as your doomed prey with this more powerful version of the hunter's mark  spell. Until the spell ends, you have advantage on any Wisdom check you make to find the target or discern any other information about it, and you deal an extra 1d10 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack.

Whenever the target takes the extra damage from this spell, until the end of its next turn it has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you while it is within 5 feet of you. A creature does not suffer disadvantage on attack rolls from this spell while it is marked by another creature.

If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours.
