You burst with blinding light that shines briefly from your skin before fading away. Each other creature within range must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature is blinded until the start of your next turn.

Until the end of your next turn, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
