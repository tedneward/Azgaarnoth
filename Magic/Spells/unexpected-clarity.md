*5th-level enchantment* (Bard,Paladin,Ranger,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you score a critical hit with an attack roll
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (a melee weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
When an astonishing strike opens a new
opportunity for you in battle, you focus your mental
energies to take full advantage of it. As part of the
reaction used to cast this spell, you make a further
melee weapon attack against a creature within your
reach. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's
normal effects. In addition, the target takes an
additional 1d12 psychic damage, and is frightened of
you until the end of its next turn.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d12 for each level above 5th.
