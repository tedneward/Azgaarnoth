You point in a direction and wake the four winds to your aid. Until the spell ends, a hurricane-force wind blows inside a 200-foot cube centered on you that follows you. The wind blows from one end of the cube to the other in the chosen direction, but it doesn't affect you. The wind disperses gas or vapor and extinguishes all flames within the area. Any ranged weapon attacks that pass into or through the area automatically miss, and creatures have advantage on any saving throws made against breath effects that blow against the direction of the wind. At the end of each of your turns while the spell lasts, any unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 60 feet away from you by the wind.

Other creatures within the area are deafened, and must spend 5 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved against the direction of the wind. In addition, other creatures can't fly within the area. If one is flying when it enters the area, it falls if it can't hover. 

Each other creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 60 feet in the direction of the wind, or pushed only 15 feet on a success. A creature can choose to fail this save automatically. 

As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction of the cube and the wind.
