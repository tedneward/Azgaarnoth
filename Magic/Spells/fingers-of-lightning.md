Your hands arc with electricity as you create 4 lines, each 100 feet long and 5 feet wide, emanating from you in directions of your choice. Each line has its own dirÂ­ection and lines can overlap, but they must all fit within a 180 degree angle from you. 

Each creature within the spell's area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d6 lightning damage plus 1d6 lightning damage for each line area that they are within. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you create an additional line of lightning for each slot level above 5th.
