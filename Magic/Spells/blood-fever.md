- **Components:** V, S, M (a mummified heart)

---
You attempt to instill a fever-like haze into the blood or mind of one creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or else become afflicted by the fever until the spell ends. The target can choose to fail this saving throw automatically. 

While afflicted by the fever, the target has resistance to psychic damage and can't be frightened, but it must use its action on each of its turns to make melee attacks against the nearest creature it can see. If that creature is not within its reach, the target must move closer until the creature is within its reach, using its action to Dash instead if it can't get close enough otherwise. If there is more than one creature that could be considered the nearest, the target chooses which to attack.

The target suffers several effects for the duration: 

* Attack rolls against it have advantage. 
* It has disadvantage on all attack rolls, except attacks that use Strength. 
* It can't cast spells or maintain concentration, and it has disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks. 
* It is immune to the calm emotions, excite emotions, and overwhelm emotions spells.

In addition, if the target has levels in the barbarian class, it gains the following benefits for the duration: 

* It gains benefits from its class features as if it were raging, even if it isn't. 
* It has advantage on attack rolls that use Strength, and whenever it hits with a melee weapon attack that uses Strength, the attack deals 2d6 bonus damage. 
* It has advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws, and it gains 30 temporary hit points. 
* Its speed is increased by 10 feet, and it can use its bonus action to Dash on each of its turns. 

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success. 
Creatures that do not have blood, can't be charmed, are immune to disease, or have levels in the barbarian class have advantage on saving throws against the spell.

This is a Blood spell.
