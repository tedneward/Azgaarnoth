___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You crush your foe's flesh and hammer its mind
with the same punishing strike. Make a melee spell
attack against a target within range. On a hit, the
target takes 3d12 force damage, and if it ends its
next turn within 5 feet of you or one of your allies, it
takes psychic damage equal to 1d12 + your
spellcasting ability modifier.
In addition, the target you hit must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you
for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the effect on itself on a success. Undead, constructs, and creatures immune to being frightened
automatically succeed on the saving throw.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the force damage
and psychic both increase by 1d12 for every two slot
levels above 4th.
