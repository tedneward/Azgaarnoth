---
A thin aura of silver-white ﬂames envelop an object that you touch, preventing rot, rust, or vermin from affecting the object for the duration. The ﬂames do not spread or deal damage, nor can they be extinguished naturally for the duration. The object must be portable and can not be more than 1000 lb. in weight. If the object is a container, its contents are affected only while they remain within the object. Casting this spell on an object already affected by this spell renews the duration.For the duration, the following effects apply on the object:

* Tiny beasts and other such vermin will avoid touching the object if possible.
* The object can not rust, rot, ferment, or be turned into an undead.
* If an undead touches the object or starts a turn in contact with the object, it must make a Constitution saving throw. The undead takes 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, and takes half damage on a successful save.
* The object emits bright light out to 20 feet, and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
