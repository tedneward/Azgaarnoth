#### Stolen Breath
*2nd-level necromancy* (Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 50 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
Choose one target within range. That target must
succeed on a Constitution save or spectral claws
reach into its chest and rip the air out of its lungs.
On a failure, it immediately begins choking (per the
rules in Chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook ), and
until the spell ends it cannot take reactions, and it
can only take either 1 action or 1 bonus action on
each of its turns. During this time, it cannot move
unless it takes an action that allows it to move (such
as the Dash action).
The target can end these effects by using its
action to catch its breath. Once it does so, it is no
longer choking, and the spell ends.
