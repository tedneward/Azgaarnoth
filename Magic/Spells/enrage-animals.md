#### Enrage Animals
*1st-level enchantment* (Bard,Druid,Ranger,Warlock)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
This spell incites and enrages animals, making them
hostile and vicious. Roll 6d10; the total is how many
hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Eligible
beasts within 30 feet of a point you choose within
range are affected in ascending order of their
current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures,
non-beasts, or beasts with an Intelligence score of 4
or higher, who are unaffected).
Starting with the creature that has the lowest
current hit points, each creature affected by this
spell enters a terrible rage for the duration. Subtract
each creatures' hit points from the total before
moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit
points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or
less than the remaining total for that creature to be
affected.
A beast that is magically bound to a master or
trained only to attack on order is allowed a Wisdom
saving throw against this effect; other beasts are
not. Creatures who succeed on their saving throws
are still deducted from the total number of hit
points of creatures you can affect.
At the beginning of its turn, an affected creature
must make a melee attack against a creature within
reach. If a beast affected by this spell has no
creatures within reach, it will move towards the
nearest creature and attack. If it cannot do so for
some reason, the beast attacks an object within
range, which may be the ground or a wall.
The first two attacks by beasts enraged by this
spell are made with advantage.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional
2d10 for each slot level above 1st. When you cast it
with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can also
affect abominations, celestials, fey, and fiends that
have assumed an animal form (such as familiars).
