Choose one creature that you can see within range that has blood. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, its blood bursts from within its body, spraying nearby foes with gore and spikes of enchanted blood. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3dl0 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage dealt increases by ldl0 for each slot level above 2nd
