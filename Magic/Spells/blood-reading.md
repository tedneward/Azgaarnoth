# Blood Reading
*1st-level divination* (Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (at least 1 ounce of a creature's blood)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You weave dark magic to pull information out of at least one ounce of blood (or around 30 grams) which the spell consumes as a material component. This blood must have come from a creature that is alive or has been dead for less than 1 hour, and the spell fails without enough blood to use. Choose two of the following options below each time you cast the spell to determine what information about the creature you learn from its blood:
* You learn the creature's type and its maximum hit points. You also learn all its resistances, vulnerabilities, and immunities.
* You learn the direction to the creature, and you learn if it is within 1 mile, within 100 miles, or beyond that (which also includes other planes of existence).
* You learn the identity of any poisons, diseases, curses, and blessings that are affecting the creature. Successful knowledge checks may also grant you insight into the nature and function of these conditions.
* You learn if the creature's blood contains any special magic, such as the healing properties of a unicorn's blood, or the ritual magic uses for some kinds of fiends' blood
* If the blood is mixed with the blood of another creature, the mixture will glow bright red if the one of the two creatures is the parent, offspring, or sibling of the other.

When you cast the spell if the target is still alive, it feels a tingling sensation in its veins and knows the exact direction to you, though it doesn't necessarily know who you are or what you are doing.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can choose one additional option for each slot level above 1st.
