#### Frost Trap
*Abjuration cantrip* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by a weapon attack
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
A weapon, claw, fist, or other physical attack is abruptly chilled upon contact with you. The attacking creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the creature fails, then the weapon (or body part, in the case of unarmed or natural attacks) is frozen to your body and cannot be used until freed.

The frost dissolves at the beginning of the affected creature's next turn. The spell can be ended early if a creature within reach uses an action to pull the weapon free of the frost.
