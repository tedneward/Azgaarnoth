#### Threehorn's Charge
*3rd-level transmutation* (Artificer,Druid,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of a triceratops corpse or fossil)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Your fingers imitate the horns of a threehorn
(triceratops) against your own head before you
touch your intended target, which then grows large
horns, a bony skull plate, and a thickened hide. You
change a willing creature you touch into a saurian
form which resembles a hybrid of their natural form
and that of a three-horned dinosaur. For the
duration of the spell, the target gains the following
traits:
* They have advantage on all Strength checks and
Strength saving throws.
* Their carrying capacity is doubled.
* Their horns act as a gore attack, a natural
weapon with which they are proficient. This is a
melee attack which inflicts 2d8 piercing
damage.
* Their armor class cannot be lower than 13 +
their Dexterity modifier, no matter what kind of
armor they are wearing.
If they move at least 20 ft. straight toward a
creature and then hit it with a gore attack on the
same turn, that target must succeed on a Strength
saving throw or be knocked prone.
