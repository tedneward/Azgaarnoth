# Return
*3rd-level abjuration* (Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take after you see a creature move

**Range:** 45 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Using your reaction, you can cause a creature to return to the space it just vacated with its current movement. If you can see a creature within range and are able to see its original location (though it need not be in range), the target must make a Charisma saving throw or be teleported back to its point of origin where it began its current turn. The target does not regain its movement speed. A creature can choose to fail the saving throw if it wishes.
