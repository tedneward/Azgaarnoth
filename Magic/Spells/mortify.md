- **Duration:** 1 round 
---
Your magic provokes a deep shame within one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 6d6 psychic damage, and until the end of its next turn, it can't take reactions or concentrate, and any attack rolls against it have advantage. 

On a successful saving throw, the target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. 

The spell can't affect constructs, undead, creatures that can't be frightened, or creatures that can't be charmed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one addiÂ­tional creature for each slot level above 3rd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
