___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a fresh corpse or animated zombie)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You select a fresh corpse (less than an hour old)
within range and gain one of its senses. For
example, you could cast the spell on a recently slain
monster and gain sight through its eyes. The effect
is stationary unless you move the corpse (or its
sensory organs). You do not benefit from any
special senses the corpse possessed in life.
While you use the senses of the corpse, your own
equivalent sensory organ is occupied. You can end
the spell at any time.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the range
increases by 100 feet and the duration increases by
10 minutes for each slot level above 1st.
