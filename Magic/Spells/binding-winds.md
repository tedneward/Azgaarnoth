#### Binding Winds
*2nd-level evocation* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You cause howling winds to surround a creature of Large size or smaller that you can see within range. The creature must make Dexterity saving throw or it is restrained by the winds. In addition, an affected creature is considered deafened to any sounds originating from outside its space and it must make a Constitution saving throw (concentration check) to cast spells with somatic components, as the howling winds block sounds and hinder its gestures.

The creature can use its action to attempt to break free of the winds by succeeding on a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it breaks free, and the spells ends.
