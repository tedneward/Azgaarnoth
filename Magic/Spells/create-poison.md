#### Create Poison
*1st-level transmutation* *(ritual)* (Artificer,Bard,Druid,Ranger,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (one vessel on your person)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small bottle or other container that can hold a draught of water)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You use some combination of scavenged
substances, focused meditation, and magic to
transform the water in a container you have on your
person into one dose of improvised poison. This
dose can be applied to one weapon, up to three
pieces of ammunition, or up to three separate
portions of food or drink. Once applied, the poison
retains potency until someone must roll a saving
throw against it, or for 1 minute, after which point it
dries or dissolves. If a creature is struck with the
poisoned weapon or ammunition, or if it ingests the
poisoned food or drink, it must make a Constitution
save or be poisoned for 1 minute and take 1d8
poison damage, or 2d8 if the poison is ingested).
Creatures that succeed on their save take half
damage, but suffer no other effects.

A poison you create can only be used by you,
and has no value if you try to sell it. If you cast this
spell again, any doses of poison you have previously
created with this spell instantly become water
again. Otherwise, poison doses created with this
spell retain their potency until the next time you
finish a long rest, at which point they return to being water.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell
using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create
one additional dose of poison for every two levels
above 1st. When you cast this spell using a spell slot
of 4th level or higher, the poison gains an extra
effect: if a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or
more, its Constitution score is reduced by 1d4 until
the creature finishes a long rest or its ability score is
restored by magic.
