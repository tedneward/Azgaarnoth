- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
With a single word of magical power, you cause two
creatures to swap places. Choose two Small or
Medium creatures that you can see within range.
You can only choose two creatures which are either
standing on the same surface or standing on
surfaces which are physically connected by solid
ground or structures. A creature which is unwilling
to be transposed gains a Charisma saving throw
against this effect. If neither creature makes a
successful saving throw, both creatures are
teleported, with each reappearing in the space
previously occupied by the other.
