#### Eruption
*5th-level evocation* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small pebble and a bit of sulfur)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You cause a volcanic eruption. Choose a point you 
can see on the ground within range. The ground 
within 5 feet of the chosen point becomes difficult 
terrain. A creature standing on the affected area 
when you cast this spell must make a Dexterity 
saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save
or half as much damage on a successful one. A 
creature must also make this saving throw when it 
ends its turn in the affected area.

Additionally, four fiery globs launch into the air 
from the eruption site, rising to a height of 20 feet 
before crashing down at four separate points you 
can see within 30 feet of the eruption site. A 
creature within 5 feet of an impact must save 
against the spell's damage, as above.

For the duration, you can use a bonus action on 
each of your turns to cause the volcano to launch 
three more globs of magma.

When the spell ends, the fire and magma 
disappear, but the difficult terrain of the eruption 
site remains until cleared.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, increase the damage 
dealt by each glob of magma by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
