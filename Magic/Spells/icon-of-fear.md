___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
one creature within the spell's range, otherwise, the
spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's
normal effects, and your weapon takes on an aspect
of iconic fear, striking dread into your foe while
emboldening a close ally. You can immediately push
the target up to 5 feet away from you.
When you push a creature with this spell, one ally
of your choice within 5 feet of you can immediately
use its reaction to move up to 10 feet. If the target
starts its next turn within 5 feet of that ally, the
target takes additional psychic damage equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier.
Creatures that are immune to the frightened
condition take no psychic damage from this spell.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an
extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target, and the
psychic damage increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting
ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8
at 11th level and 17th level.
