There is a bare whisper of rushing air as a protective
field of shadowy energy cloaks your body. For the
duration, you have resistance to force damage from
spells, and you take no damage from magic missile. In addition, for the spell's duration, whenever you
make a saving throw, roll a d4 and add the number
rolled as a bonus to your saving throw. The spell
ends at the end of the turn if you are exposed to
direct sunlight.
