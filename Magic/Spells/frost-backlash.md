#### Frost Backlash
*2nd-level evocation* (Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take in response to being hit with an attack roll by a creature within 5 feet of you
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
As part of the reaction used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
the creature who made the triggering attack,
otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers
the attack's normal effects and takes an additional
3d6 cold damage. On a miss, the target takes no
damage from your melee weapon attack, but takes
half the extra cold damage it would have inflicted.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the cold damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
