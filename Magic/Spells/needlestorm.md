must make a Dexterity saving throw. They take 2d6
piercing damage on a failed save and half as much
on a successful one. This damage counts as magical
for the purposes of overcoming damage resistance.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d6 piercing damage for each spell slot
above 3rd.
