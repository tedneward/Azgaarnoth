You create a cloud of spores that infect the
brain of a creature you can see within range.
The target must make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature takes 4d6 psychic damage,
and it has disadvantage on
Intelligence ability checks and saving
throws until the end of its next turn.
On a successful save, the target doesn't
take damage or have disadvantage on
Intelligence ability checks and saving
throws.
You can use an action on each of your turns
for the duration to force the target to make another
Constitution saving throw or suffer the spell's
damage and effects.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
5th.
