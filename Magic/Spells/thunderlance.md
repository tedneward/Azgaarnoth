#### Thunderlance
*4th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small metal spear)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You transform a metal spear into a lance that embodies the power of a thunder storm. You can wield the lance to make melee spell attacks against enemies within 20 feet of you.

As part of the action used to cast the spell, and again by using an action on each of your turns for the duration, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 20 feet. On a hit, the target takes 6d6 thunder damage. If this lance leaves your hand for any reason, such as if you are disarmed or otherwise forced to drop it, you can call it back to your hand using a bonus action.
