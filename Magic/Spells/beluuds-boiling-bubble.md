*6th-level conjuration* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a boiled frog)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure a steaming bubble of boiling water to capture one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it is trapped inside the bubble and it takes 4d8 fire damage. On a success, it takes half as much damage and the spell ends.

While trapped by the bubble, the target is restrained and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water, and at the start of each of its turns, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the start of its next turn. Also, when the target ends its turn within the bubble, it takes 4d8 fire damage, and the bubble rises 10 feet higher into the air. The target does not fall while it is trapped in the bubble.

To escape the bubble, the target can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself from the bubble and falls unless it can fly or stop the falL and the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the bubble vanishes, and each creature trapped inside falls unless it can stop the fall.
