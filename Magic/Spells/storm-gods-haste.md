You touch a willing creature and invest it with lightning speed. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is tripled, it gains a +3 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains two additional actions on each of its turns. These actions can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

For the duration, the target also has resistance to lightning damage, has advantage on weapon attack rolls, and deals 1d6 bonus lightning damage when it hits with a weapon attack. In addition, it can use a bonus action on itsturn to teleport in a flash of lightning up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space that it can see.

When the spell ends, the target falls prone and is both stunned and paralyzed until the end of its next turn, as a wave of lethargy and electricity, and pain sweeps over it. 

A creature affected by this spell gains no benefit from the [haste](haste.md) spell.
