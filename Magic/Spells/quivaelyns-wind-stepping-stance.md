A series of precise, silent gestures places you in a state in which you can run up anything that has any substance, even if it could not normally bear your weight: a cloud of dust, falling snowflakes, tiny branches, cherry blossoms on the breeze, and so on.

For the duration, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb vertically, at an angle, or move horizontally, through any unoccupied space, as long as there is anything more substantial than air within that space and it is not more than 40 feet above a surface on which you can stand. The spell ends early if you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.
