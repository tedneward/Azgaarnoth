*enchantment cantrip* *(brandish)* (Bard,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
As part of casting this spell, the caster must make an attack with a weapon.

Once struck with this spell, the target must make a WIS save. On a failed save, if the target chooses to not attack, or to attack someone other than the caster, then all melee weapon attacks against the target will be at advantage until the end of the target's next turn.

If the target fails the save, they know they have been struck by a charm spell, but they also know how to break the charm: If the target uses their next weapon attack on the caster, then the charm is broken and holds no effect. 

If the target saves successfully, there is no effect.
