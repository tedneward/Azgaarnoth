- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You summon four otherworldly aberrations that
appear as giant spiders  in unoccupied spaces you can see within range (your DM has statistics for
giant spiders). The spiders are friendly to you and
aid you to the best of their abilities. The spiders
have their own initiative and act on their own turns
for the duration. The spiders obey your commands
without you having to spend an action; if you don't
issue a command, the spiders defend themselves if
they are threatened.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 8th level, you summon two extra
spiders.
