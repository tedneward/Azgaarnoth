#### Feat of Magnificence
*4th-level transmutation* (Bard,Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
A creature you touch gains the potential to perform
prodigious deeds. Once before the end of its next
turn, when the target rolls an ability check, attack
roll, or saving throw, it can choose to gain a +10
bonus to that roll, and it treats a roll of 19 or lower
on the d20 as a 20. The spell ends when the target
gains this bonus to a roll, or if it hasn't used this
bonus by the end of its net turn.
