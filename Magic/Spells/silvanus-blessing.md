# Silvanus' Blessing
*2nd-level necromancy* (Druid, Pale Master, Ranger)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a small diamond worth at least 50 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You return a dead beast you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 8 hours. If the beast's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the beast returns to life with half of its total hit points, rejuvenated by the blessing of Silvanus.

This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the beast at the time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the beast returns to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival - its head, for instance - the spell automatically fails.
