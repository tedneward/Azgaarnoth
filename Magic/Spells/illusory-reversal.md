#### Illusory Reversal
*2nd-level illusion* (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you or a willing creature in range is hit by an attack 
- **Range:** 60 feet 
- **Components:** V 
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 
---
You weave a clever illusion at the right time, confusing the attacker as they strike. The attacker must make an Intelligence saving throw. It automatically succeeds if it doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or if it can see through illusions, as with truesight. 

On a failed save, the attack does not hit the original target. You may also choose one creature within 5 feet of the original target other than the attacker, forcing the attacker to reroll the attack against that creature. If it is a melee attack, the new target must be within the reach of the attacker. On a successful save, the attack hits the original target, but the attack's damage is reduced by an amount equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum 1).
