Select up to seven friendly creatures within range
(one of which may be you). Each target is
surrounded by a crystal blue ghost-like aura that
grants it a +4 bonus to its Armor Class against all
attacks by undead creatures.
In addition, each target gains the benefits of the
death ward  spell, and it automatically succeeds on
any saving throw it makes against an undead
creature, unless that saving throw is against a spell.
