You call down a swirling sand cloud to fill a 150-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the area is difficult terrain and heavily obscured. Creatures in the area are deafened by the howling storm, and any ranged weapon attacks that pass in or out of the area are made with disadvantage. The sand disperses any vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind, and it extinguishes unprotected flames if they’re Large-sized or smaller.

If you’re within range of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a bonus action on your turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level, the range is 1 mile. If you use a spell slot of 9th level, the range is Sight.
