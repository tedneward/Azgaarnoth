- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
From your body erupts a wave of bright white illumination, engulfing everything nearby. Each creature within 20 feet must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn. A creature takes half damage on a successful save.

The light lingers brieﬂy, shedding bright light out to a radius of 60 feet, and dim light for an additional 60 feet until the start of your next turn. This is treated as magical light. If any of this spell’s area overlaps with darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you increase the radiant damage by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
