A cone of swirling energy surrounds you. Any spell
that targets you or includes you its area of effect is
absorbed into the cone. Note that a spell that
includes you in its area effect will not affect you, but will affect other targets normally. Any spell you cast
is automatically absorbed by the cone.
On your turn, you can generate one missile for
every spell level the cone absorbed since your last
turn. Treat each missile as if it's a magic missile that
inflicts 1d6+1 force damage. Any unused spell levels
are lost at the end or your turn.
