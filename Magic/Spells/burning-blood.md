You infect the blood of a creature within range with
a toxic mixture of corrosive fluids. The target must
make a Constitution saving throw. On failure, it
takes 1d8 acid damage and 1d8 fire damage. Until
the spell ends, the target can't take reactions, and it
can only take move actions on its turn.
On a successful save, the target doesn't take any
damage or suffer any ill effects that turn. However,
for the spell's duration, the target must make a new
Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its
turns, or it takes the damage and suffers the spell's
effects.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the amount of acid
and fire damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 4th.
