This spell is a minor magical trick that cryomancers use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

* You create a small, harmless sensory effect, such as a sprinkling of snowflakes or a patch of thin frost.
* You chill up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
* You grant a creature advantage on saving throws against hot weather for 1 hour.
* You instantaneously freeze a volume of water no more than 1 foot in any dimension.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
