*Conjuration cantrip (Druid,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a hostile creature you can see within 10 feet of you takes the Disengage action or makes an attack that does not target you
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a melee weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You draw on magic of the Feywild to quickly teleport in order to punish an enemy who ignores you. When you use your reaction to cast this spell, you can teleport up to 10 feet to any unoccupied
space where the triggering creature would be within the reach of your melee weapon. As part of the same reaction, you can immediately make one melee weapon attack against the triggering creature. The
amount of damage inflicted by this attack cannot be higher than your spellcasting ability modifier.

The damage of attacks you make with this spell increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage to the target. This extra radiant damage increases to 2d4 at 11th level and 3d4 at 17th level. Whenever you add this radiant damage to the damage of your weapon attack, the maximum amount of damage the attack can inflict is equal to the amount of radiant damage + your spellcasting ability modifier.
