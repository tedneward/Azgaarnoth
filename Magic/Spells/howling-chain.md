A red chain of force wraps itself around a target you choose within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being grappled by the chain. On a failed save, the target is grappled by the chain as it twists and writhes around it, causing the creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks while it is grappled. In addition, on each of your turns, you can use an action to make a melee spell attack against the grappled target. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 piercing damage. The victim can attempt a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns to avoid being grappled by the chain. On a success, the target breaks free.

If a target escapes before the spell ends, you may use an action to choose a new target within 30 feet of the previous one. The chains move to that target, who must make the Dexterity saving throw to avoid being grappled. The spell then continues as normal.
