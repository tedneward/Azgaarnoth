- **Duration:** Instantaneous 
---
You invoke great magic to spark sudden and miraculous healing out of the natural healing capabilities of up to twenty creatures that you can see within range. Each target must be willing or unconscious. 

Each target gains one level of exhaustion, can cure one poison or disease affecting it, regains hit points equal to 50 + half of its maximum hit points, and must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain one additionallevel of exhaustion. It can also choose to instantly spend hit dice to regain hit points as if it had just finished a short rest, up to a number of hit dice equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 hit die). 

Any unconscious creature whose maximum hit points are less than 50 automatically fails the Constitution saving throw when healed by this spell and its body is so drained of energy that it won't regain consciousness until it finishes a long rest. 

This spell has no effect on creatures that are naturally immune to exhaustion, such as constructs, or undead.
