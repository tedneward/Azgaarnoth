From thought you create matter, equipping yourself
with a simple implement you need. You summon
one piece of adventuring gear worth 2 gp or less
which you can hold in one hand, and which must
weigh less than 10 pounds.

If the item is more than 10 feet away from you at
the end of your turn, the spell ends. This object may
simulate the effects of a tool which requires
proficiency, but it can only be used to make one
ability check, for a task that takes 1 round or less,
after which time the spell ends. Anyone who holds
the item or examines it closely can tell it is not real.
When the spell ends, the item disappears.
