You reach out and touch the darkness between the
stars, absorbing its abyssal essence into your body.
Your form becomes wrapped in shadows, and
tentacles burst from your shoulders and spine. You
cannot be identified, except by the spell true seeing ,
or a similar magical effect.

You gain a +4 bonus to AC and for the duration
you are immune to falling damage and can walk on
water and other liquids (as if you were the subject
of a water walk  spell). As a bonus action on each of
your turns for the duration, you can order your
tentacles to attack a target within 10 feet. Make a
melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d6
acid damage.
