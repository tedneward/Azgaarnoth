# Reverse Teleportation
*8th-level conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Same plane of existence

**Components**: V, S, M (one ruby worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You attempt to summon a creature or object to your location. You hold a creature or object with which you are familiar in your mind, and attempt to summon it to a location within 5 feet of you. The creature or object must be Medium or smaller, it must be on the same plane as you, and you must know its general location; to within a mile of its actual location.

A willing creature is automatically teleported to you. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be teleported to your location. If the target is an object, you must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to successfully summon the item. Certain situations, like an object being protected by powerful magic, or an object being worn or in the possession of another creature, imposes disadvantage on this check and may even cause the spell to fail (DMâ€™s discretion).

If for any reason, the spell fails, you take 6d10 psychic damage.
