When you cast this spell, a
wickedly bladed dart or throwing star made of black metal appears in
your hand, and you hurl it instantly. Make a ranged
spell attack against the target. You have advantage
on this attack if you are lightly or heavily obscured
from your target. The target is considered to have
half cover against this attack if it is standing in
direct sunlight (half cover grants +2 AC).
On a hit, the target takes 1d10 piercing damage.
Hit or miss, the projectile breaks and explodes in a
shower of shrapnel. The target and each creature
within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or take one level of exhaustion and 1d8
necrotic damage. When a creature that already has
one or more levels of exhaustion gains a new level
of exhaustion from this spell, it becomes immune to
gaining further levels of exhaustion from this spell
for 24 hours.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a 2nd level or higher spell slot, the necrotic damage
increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
