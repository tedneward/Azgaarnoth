#### Purifying Flame
*5th-level evocation* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You release a cone of golden flame that burns 
away impurities. Each creature in the area must 
make a Dexterity saving throw. Undead creatures 
have disadvantage on this saving throw. A creature 
takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one.

For each damage die that rolls a 5 or a 6, one 
ongoing spell or magical effect in the area is 
dispelled unless it is of a higher spell level than the 
spell slot used to cast this spell. The lowest-level 
spells in the area are dispelled first.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
