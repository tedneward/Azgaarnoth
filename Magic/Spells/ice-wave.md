# Ice Wave
*6th-level evocation* (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 5 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (white dragon scales worth 100 gp)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch the ground within 5 feet of you, sending a wave of ice shooting forward. The ice forms a line outward from your position that can be up to 40 feet long, up to 10 feet wide, and up to 20 feet tall. Each creature within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 cold damage and 2d8 bludgeoning damage. Additionally, its movement speed becomes 0 until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and it does not suffer a movement speed penalty.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the cold damage or the bludgeoning damage (your choice) increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.
