A blinding flash of light leaps from your hand to a
target. Choose one target within range, that target
must make a Dexterity saving throw. They take 8d8
radiant damage on a failed save and half as much on
a successful one. Undead are particularly vulnerable
to this spell, making the save with disadvantage.
Undead that are weak to sunlight (vampires, for
example) are blinded until the end of their next
turn if they fail the Dexterity saving throw.
