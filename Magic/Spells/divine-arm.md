Originally conceived in the darkest hours of an ancient war, this spell forges a weapon of light that can topple mighty foes. A weapon of brightly glowing, solid magical force appears in your hands, carrying the divine wrath of your deity. The weapon is indestructible, functions as a weapon of your choice, can only be picked up by creatures you allow, and has the following properties:

* The weapon is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance and immunity .
* The weapon grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls on weapon attacks made with it.
* The weapon is treated as an artifact or deityâ€™s magic for the purpose of effects that suppress magic items, and deals no damage on weapon attacks to fellow members of your faith or allies.
* The weapon deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage and 2d6 force damage on hit when wielded for weapon attacks. (3d6 each instead against undead, fiends, and servants of an enemy faith).
* If separated from the weapon, the most recent wielder can use a bonus action to mentally will the weapon to teleport back to hand.
