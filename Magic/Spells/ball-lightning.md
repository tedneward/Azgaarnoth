A 5-foot diameter ball of lightning appears at a point you choose within range and lasts for the spell's duration. Any creature in the ball's area when the spell is cast takes 5d8 lightning damage, or half as much on a successful Dexterity saving throw.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can move the ball of lightning up to 30 feet vertically or horizontally. The ball stops moving for the round and deals 5d8 lightning damage if it touches a creature during its movement. A creature takes half the lightning damage on a successful Dexterity saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the amount of lightning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
