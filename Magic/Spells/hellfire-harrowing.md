- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You summon the very fires of Nine Hells to scourge your enemy, burning the soul as well as the flesh. Choose one target within range. That target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 10d6 fire damage on failed save, and half as much on a success. This damage treats immunity to fire damage as resistance and ignores resistance.

***At Higher Levels.*** You can cast this spell using a 5th level or higher spell slot, and you inflict plus 1d6 damage per spell level above 4th.
