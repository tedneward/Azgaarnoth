---
You encase your surroundings with ice, locking 
yourself and nearby creatures in a cave-like prison of
ice. The maximum size of the enclosure is a 60-foot-
radius sphere centered on you, but sturdy surfaces 
will be lined with ice to form the interior contours 
of the area. The ice is 6 inches thick where layered 
onto existing surfaces, and 3 feet thick where free-
standing.

If the ice cuts through a creature's space, the 
creature is pushed either inside or outside the 
enclosure (your choice). When the ice appears, you 
can cause up to 10 icy stalactites or stalagmites to 
form, jabbing abruptly inward from the walls, floor, 
or ceiling of the ice cave. Each spike is 5 feet long 
and 3 feet wide at the base. A creature whose space 
gets spiked must make a Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 2d8 piercing damage and 3d6 cold damage per
spike on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can 
cause up to 5 spikes to erupt or dissolve (or a mix of both).
