# Oghma's Knowledge Transferal
*5th-level transmutation* (Pale Master, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a creature casts a spell

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You are able to magically transfer your knowledge into another willing creature, allowing them to gain some of your arcane insight. When an ally would cast a spell of 3rd level or lower on their turn, you may use your reaction to grant them access to your list of prepared spells to select from, provided they can be cast at the given level.

Your ally's casting of the spell uses their spell slot of the appropriate level, and it behaves as though they cast it for the purposes of concentration, spell attack rolls, and saving throw DC.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell level that you can cast through an ally increases by one level for each spell level above 5th.
