#### Megalith
*9th-level conjuration* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 300 feet 
- **Components:** V, S, M (a stone with no moss) 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
---
You conjure a massive stone orb with a diameter of 20 feet at a point that you can see within range. It crashes into the ground then rolls up to 100 feet in a straight line to an unoccupied space. The orb grants cover and blocks vision. It is an object with 17 AC and 150 hit points, it has vulnerability to thunder damage, and the spell ends if it is destroyed.

Each creature in the orb's space when it appears or in its path when it rolls must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d12 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. For the duration, you can use an action on your turn if you are within range of the orb to push it with magic, causing it to roll up to 100 feet in a straight line to an unoccupied space again. 

The orb deals double damage to objects, but it can't roll through an object unless it deals enough damage to destroy the object. If the orb finishes its movement on an incline, it may roll downhill at the end of that turn (at the DM's discretion) rolling each turn until you use an action to roll it again or it reaches level ground.

When the spell ends, the orb vanishes.
