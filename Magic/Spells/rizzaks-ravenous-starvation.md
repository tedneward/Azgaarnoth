#### Rizzak's Ravenous Starvation 
*6th-level necromancy* (Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (vulture liver and stale bread) 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 
---
You strike up to four creatures that you can see within range with deadly magical hunger that threatens to devour them from the inside. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a target takes 10d4 acid damage and it is [poisoned](../../Conditions/Poisoned.md#arcanic-poison) until the spell ends. On a successful saving throw, it takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.

A poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success and taking 6d4 acid damage on a failure. 

A creature can use its action to eat as quickly as it can, if it has unspoiled food available to eat. As a result, it gains advantage on its next saving throw against the spell and it doesn't take damage if it fails that saving throw, but it gains no sustenance from the food.

A creature suffering from exhaustion by starvation has disadvantage on the saving throw.

Any creature that does not need to eat is immune to the spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 6th.
