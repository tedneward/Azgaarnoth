You touch your target and run your hands across its skin, causing strips of flesh to peel away from its body. Once this effect has started, only you or [dispel magic](./dispel-magic.md) can stop it. 

When you first cast this spell, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature who fails its saving throw takes 2d6 slashing damage, and its Charisma score is reduced by 1. If the save is successful, the creature takes half the damage, and its Charisma is unaffected.

On each of your turns for the spell's duration, you can use a bonus action to further mutilate your target, and the effects increase each time you do so, as follows:

**First bonus action.** The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it takes 4d6 slashing damage, and its Charisma score is reduced by 1d4. If it succeeds, it takes half as much slashing damage, and its Charisma is unaffected.

**Second bonus action.** The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it takes 6d6 slashing damage, and its Charisma score is reduced by 2d4. If it succeeds, it takes half as much slashing damage, and its Charisma is unaffected.

**Third bonus action.** The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it takes 8d6 slashing damage, and its Charisma score is reduced by 2d4. If it succeeds, it takes half as much slashing damage, and its Charisma is unaffected. Half of the reduction in Charisma from failing this last saving throw is permanent.

If a target's hit points are reduced to 0 by this spell, the target immediately dies as the flesh is ripped away from its bones. The target's Charisma cannot drop below 1.

The slashing damage can be healed normally. The reduction to Charisma can be healed by the [regenerate](./regenerate.md) spell, by the [wish](./wish.md) spell, or by resting for 48 hours after the hit point damage has been healed, except for any permanent reduction, which cannot be healed by anything short of a [wish](./wish.md).
