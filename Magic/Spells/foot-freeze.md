*Evocation cantrip* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You cause thick frost to form around a creature's feet to immobilize it. Choose a creature you can see within range that is touching a floor or other surface. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be frozen to the surface. If the surface is immobile, the creature's speed is reduced to 0.

The frost dissolves at the end of the affected creature's turn. An affected creature can break free early by spending an action.
