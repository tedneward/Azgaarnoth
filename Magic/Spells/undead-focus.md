___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (the eyes of a zombie)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Choose a zombie or skeleton within range you
control. For the duration, whenever you cast a spell
of 4th-level or lower, you can cast the spell as if it
originated in that undead creature's space instead of
your own. If such a spell has a range of touch, you
can deliver the spell as if you were standing where
the undead creature is.
Whenever you cast a spell as if it originated in
the space of the undead creature, it takes 1d6 force
damage for every spell level you channel through it.
If the damage exceeds the creature's remaining hit
points, you take the remaining damage. This force
damage cannot be reduced by any means.
