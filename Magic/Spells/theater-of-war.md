#### Theater of War
*3rd-level enchantment* *(brandish)* (Bard,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects.

Once the caster strikes any hostile target, all terrain in a 40-ft radius around the target immediately becomes difficult terrain (if it wasn't already so) to traverse for all creatures hostile to the caster.

Any terrain that was already difficult remains so, but does not prove any more difficult as a result of this spell. 

The area of effect remains stationary regardless of where the original target moves to.
