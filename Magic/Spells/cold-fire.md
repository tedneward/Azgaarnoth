*1st-level transmutation* (Cleric,Paladin)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a source of fire within range)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes, or instantaneous
---
Choose a fire within the spell's range that has a
maximum area of a 20-foot cube. This fire is
transformed into magical cold fire for the duration,
with blue-tinged flames. The affected area deals 1d6
cold damage to any creature that starts its turn
within the cube.

You can alternatively target a fire elemental or a
creature that has vulnerability to cold damage. In
this case, the spell's effect is instantaneous, and the
target must make a Constitution saving throw. The
target takes 2d10 cold damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell scales in
two different ways. If you cast the spell to affect a
fire, the volume increases by a 10-foot cube and the
cold damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 1st. However, if you targeted a creature, the
cold damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level
above 1st.
