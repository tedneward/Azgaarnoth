strike a target you can see within range. The target
must make a Constitution saving throw. On failure,
the target takes 3d4 poison damage, and is poisoned
until the end of its next turn. On a successful save,
it only takes half damage and isn't poisoned.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you deal an extra
1d4 poison damage, and the poisoned condition
lasts one round longer for each slot level above 1st.
