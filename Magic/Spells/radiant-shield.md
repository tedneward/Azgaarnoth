#### Radiant Shield
*4th-level abjuration* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a glass sphere)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You conjure a shimmering shield of light around a creature you touch. The shield has a number of hit points equal to twice your wizard level. Any time the creature takes damage, half of this damage is taken by the shield instead. If the shield does not have enough hit points to absorb half of the damage, or if the damage reduces the shield to zero hit points, the creature takes all of the remaining damage after the shield has been reduced to zero hit points.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the shieldâ€™s hit points increase by double your wizard level for every two slot levels above 4th.
