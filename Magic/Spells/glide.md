# Glide
*1st-level transmutation* (Artificer, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you fall

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute.

You weave magic in a swirl as you falL creating an invisible sheet of force much like a glider or parachute in one or two of your hands that allows you to slow your descent and convert it to horizontal movement.

Until the spell ends, you fall no faster than 100 feet per round and you do not take falling damage. While you are holding the glider with two hands, you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend while falling. 

Your flying movement using this spell is highly affected by air currents, and you can be blown off-course if the wind around you is significantly unfavorable. If you are no longer holding the glider at any time, the spell ends. When the spell ends, you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd leveL the duration increases to up to 10 minutes. A slot of 3rd level or higher increases the duration to up to 1 hour.
