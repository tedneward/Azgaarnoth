---
You beckon an elemental meteor to descend from above and strike the ground in a fiery explosion at a point you can see within range. Each creature within a 30-foot sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 fire damage and 3d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

After impact, the flaming meteor lurches out of its crater, awakens, and separates into a [fire elemental](../../Creatures/Extraplanar/Elementals.md#fire-elemental) and an [earth elemental](../../Creatures/Extraplanar/Elementals.md#earth-elemental) each of which disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. Each of the elementals takes bludgeoning damage equal to half its maximum hit points from the impact. Creatures in the earth elemental's space are pushed away from the cen­ter of the impact point until they are completely outside the elemental's space.

The elementals are friendly to you and your compan­ions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elementals, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal com­mands that you issue to them (no action required by 
you). If you don't issue any commands to the elementals, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the elementals don't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elementals, they become hostile toward you and your companions, and they might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.

This spell deals double damage to objects and structures in the area of the meteor impact. Additionally, ground within the area becomes difficult terrain until cleared Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
