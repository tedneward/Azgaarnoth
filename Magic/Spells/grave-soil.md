You infuse the ground within an area you choose within range with necromantic energy. The area is a cube up to 50 feet on a side. This magic darkens the earth and causes spectral hands to rise and grasp for the living. Until the spell ends, each creature that starts its turn on the affected ground or moves onto it for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 necrotic damage, or 4d8 necrotic damage if it is prone, and until the start of its next turn, it is restrained and can't regain hit points. 

On a success, it takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. The spell treats creatures that cannot be prone as if they are always prone instead.

Creatures that are buried in or burrowing through the affected ground have disadvantage on the saving throw, and they are paralyzed while restrained by the spell.

The spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
