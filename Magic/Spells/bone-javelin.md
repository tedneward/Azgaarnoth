You create a magical javelin that hovers above your head. When the javelin appears, make a ranged spell attack against a target of your choice within range. The javelin ignores up to three-quarters cover as it turns in flight to avoid obstacles. On a successful hit, the target takes 3d6 piercing damage. Regardless of whether you hit or not, the javelin reappears above your head. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.
