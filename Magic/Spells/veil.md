# Veil
*Conjuration cantrip* (Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by a melee attack that deals damage

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A thick pale mist radiates from you after you take damage from a melee attack. You are treated as having total cover, but are blinded and deafened until the end of your next turn, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
