# Grimlore's Crippling Incursion
*8th-level necromancy* (Pale Master, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (30-foot cone)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You point an outstretched hand with fingers spread and emanate a blanket of necrotic energy from your fingertips. Each creature that you choose in a 30-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 5d12 necrotic damage and suffers 2 levels of exhaustion on a failed save, as their bones become frail and strength leaves their body. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and do not become exhausted but become frightened of you until the end of their next turn.
