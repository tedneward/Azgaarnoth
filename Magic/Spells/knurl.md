One arm transforms into a gnarled tree branch. Your hand becomes a thick knotted fist, you cannot hold anything in your hand, but it excels as a club.

The limb constantly twitches and can grow suddenly to crush enemies. For the duration, you can make a melee spell attack against any creature within 15 feet. If you hit, the target takes 2d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier bludgeoning damage. This is considered magic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

You cannot cast spells with somatic components for the duration of this spell.
