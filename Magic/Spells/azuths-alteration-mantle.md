___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You create a shimmering magical aura around any
creature you touch. While casting this spell you
name two other spells. The warded creature is
immune to all effects of the two spells you name,
and whenever it is targeted by one of those spells, it
must make a choice between the following two
effects:
* Healing:  The warded creature can convert the
incoming spell into healing energy. It heals 1d6
hit points per level of the spell targeting it. * Return Casting:  The caster of the spell
targeting the warded creature becomes the
target of that spell instead. For any effects not
determined when the spell was initially cast, the
warded creature is considered the caster of the
spell.
