___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 150 feet 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 
---
You cause an unseen storm of raw emotion in a 30-foot sphere within range. Up to four creatures of your choice that you can see within the area must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 12d6 psychic damage and is both charmed by you and frightened of you until the spell ends. While charmed or frightened in this way, a creature is incapacitated as it blubbers, screams, sobs, or expresses emotion in some other way. On a successful saving throw, it takes half as much damage and isn't charmed or frightened.

An affected creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it is no longer charmed or frightened by the spell.

Damage from the spell can't reduce a target to less than 1 hit point. Undead, constructs, and creatures that can't be charmed or frightened are immune to the spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can affect one extra creature within the area for each slot level above 7th.
