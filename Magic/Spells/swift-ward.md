You ward yourself in a hasty barrier of magical energy to protect against danger, granting you a protective ward that lasts until the end of your next turn. 

The ward has hit points equal to 6d6 + twice your spellcasting ability modifier. If you would take damage, the ward blocks and takes that damage instead. The ward cannot block psychic or poison damage unless it is dealt by an attack. If the ward is reduced to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage and the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the ward hit points increase by 2d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
