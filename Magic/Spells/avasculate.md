You fire a blood red ray from your hand that strikes a target that you can see within range. The target begins to violently erupt blood from its pores, nose, mouth and eyes. The creature must make Constitution save. If they fail, their hit points are reduced to half their current total and they are poisoned until the start of your next turn. This spell has no effect on undead and constructs.
