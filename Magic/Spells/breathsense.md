You can detect the presence of all breathing
creatures within 150 feet of you. The size of each
creature and its general direction can be
determined, but not its exact location. You can
sense the general size of a creature by its breathing.
However, the breath signature of a creature can be
muffled if it is behind total cover or in another
room. You'll detect a creature as one size smaller if
it is behind total cover.
