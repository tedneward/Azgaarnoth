#### Starlight Storm
*7th-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny strip of mithral)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You cause a distortion in the air to appear above a 60-foot tall, 30-foot radius cylinder centered at a target point on the ground you can see. Within the distortion more than a hundred motes of light appear, which proceed to shoot beams of light downwards into the target area. Every creature within the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d12 radiant damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a slot of 8th level or higher, then you increase the damage by 1d12 per level higher than 7th.
