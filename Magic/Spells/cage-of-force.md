You construct a prison of solidified force that appears around one or more creatures you can see within a vertically-oriented 5-ft. radius, 15-ft. high cylinder. The creature(s) is surrounded on all sides by bars made of transparent force, with 3-inch spaces between. If a creature is too large to fit into the prison, the spell ends. The prison disappears when the spell ends. The prison remains fixed in space for the duration even if created in midair. The prison does not have a ﬂoor if oriented upon the ground.Nothing can physically pass through the bars (but creatures and objects passing between the bars are unobstructed). The prison is immune to all damage (but can be dispelled). A [disintegrate](./disintegrate.md) spell destroys the prison instantly, however. The prison also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the bars (but not between the bars).

If cast as a ritual, the spell’s material component is replaced by a diamond worth at least 200 gp, which is consumed in the casting. The prison becomes permanent until dispelled and no longer requires concentration to maintain if the spell is cast as a ritual. Additional castings of the spell as a ritual can further expand the size of the prison instead of creating new prisons. If cast as a ritual, you can establish a spoken password to enable the prison to form an opening large enough for creatures to enter and exit the prison; the same password closes the opening.
