You evoke a a shimmering, silver, lancelike column of force in your free hand, then hurl it at an enemy. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range. The target takes 3d10 force damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss. Whether you hit or miss, the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target falls prone.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
