You create a magical wall of solid silvery force centered on a point that you can see within range. The wall lasts for the duration. It can be up to 20 feet wide and 20 feet tall but it has no depth. The outward side faces directly away from you, and the inward side faces directly toward you. The wall passes harmlessly through objects when it is created, but after that it blocks the movement of any object that it is not passing through. If the wall passes through any creatures when it is created, the Â· spell fails and the wall vanishes.

The wall provides total cover and acts like any solid wall but it doesn't block sight or any other senses, and anything on the other side is lightly obscured by the wall's colors. Moving through the wall is only possible from the inward side to the outward side, and it costs 15 extra feet of movement to pass through. Ranged attacks can pass through the wall with disadvantage if made from the inward side, but are blocked if made from the outward side. Melee attacks are blocked from either side. The wall has 30 hit points and AC equal to 11 + your 
spellcasting modifier (minimum 12 AC). It automatically fails saving throws for spells and effects. If the wall blocks a spell or effect that deals damage, it takes the damage. If it blocks an attack, the attack is made against it instead, and it takes the damage on a hit. 

If the wall is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the wall's hit points increase by 15 and its height and width increase by 5 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
