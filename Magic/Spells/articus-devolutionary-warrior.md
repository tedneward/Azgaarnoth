Choose one humanoid creature within range. If the target is willing, the spell immediately takes effect. If the target resists, it must make an Intelligence saving throw, and the spell only takes effect if it fails.

Until the spell ends, the target undergoes the following changes:

* Its Strength is increased to 20;
* Is Intelligence and Wisdom are reduced to 5;
* It has disadvantage on Charisma (Performance or Persuasion) checks;
* Its nails become thick claws, allowing it to deal 1d8 slashing damage with unarmed strikes instead of the normal damage; * The target must drop any melee or ranged weapon in favor of its new claws;
* It gains +10 to its preferred speed;
* The target's posture becomes noticeably hunched, and its hair becomes thick and coarse.
