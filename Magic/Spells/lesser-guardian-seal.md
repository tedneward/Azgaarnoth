You target a closable object (a door, window, box etc.) and name one creature type. Any creature of that type cannot open that object. The creature also cannot damage the object, nor attempt to pick or break the lock. If another creature tries to break the lock or damage the object, the object also becomes resistant to all damage and the DC to break the object increases by 10. Casting [knock](knock.md) on the object suppresses this spell for 1 minute.
