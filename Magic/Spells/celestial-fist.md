---
You conjure a great fist of light that smashes down on your enemy and seeks to hold that foe fast in its grip. Choose a large or smaller creature within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4d4 radiant damage and is restrained until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and isnâ€™t restrained.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radiant damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
