#### Halo of Glory
*1st-level abjuration* (Cleric, Paladin)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** Touch 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** 10 minutes 
---
A glowing halo of light appears above the head of a creature you touch and lasts for the duration. The halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, follows the target as it moves, and bathes the target in an impression of heavenly glory, granting it advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks. 

If a creature hits the target with an attack before the spell ends, the halo shoots a ray of light at the attacker, which must make a Dexterity saving throw if it is within 60 feet of the target. On a failed saving throw, the attacker takes 2d6 radiant damage. The spell ends after shooting one ray.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the number of rays the halo can shoot before the spell ends increases by one for each slot level above 1st.
