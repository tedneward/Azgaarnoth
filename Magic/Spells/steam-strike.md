#### Steam Strike
*4th-level conjuration* (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 60 feet 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 
---
You launch a curling blast of scalding hot steam at one creature that you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 11d4 fire damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the blindness on a success. On a miss, the target takes half damage and is not blinded.

Hit or miss, the target's space is filled with steam and mist that makes it lightly obscured until the end of your next turn or until a wind of any speed disperses it. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.
