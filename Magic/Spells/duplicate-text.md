#### Duplicate Text
*5th-level transmutation* (Artificer,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a feather, and varies)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A glowing feather quill appears in the air. You can
make the quill copy any writing, script, or runes
that you can see within range onto another suitable
surface that you can see within range. The original
writing remains intact after the duplicate is made.
This spell will make an exact copy of magical
writing without error, such as that from a scroll,
glyph, or a spell from a spell book.
Only a feather is needed as the material
component to copy nonmagical writing from one
source onto another. However, the spellcaster will
need a piece of parchment, a book page, or another
suitable object to duplicate spell scrolls in addition
to the necessary spell components, which are
consumed by the spell in the process. A glyph,
runes, or writing can be copied onto stone, wood, or
another suitable surface, but might not be mobile or
easily carried in many circumstances.
This spell can only duplicate 1st level spell scrolls
(see exception below). In addition, you can't use a
spell focus to substitute for the components when
copying scrolls.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a higher-level spell slot than 4th level, you can copy
a spell scroll one level higher for every two slot
levels above 4th. For example, you could copy a 2nd
level spell scroll with a 6th level spell slot, or a 3rd
level spell scroll with an 8th level slot.
