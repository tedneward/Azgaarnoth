opportunity attacks and all other attacks made as
part of a creature's reaction. Each time you cast
another spell of 1st-level or higher while
concentrating on this one, the bonus from this spell
improves. The bonus increases by a number equal
to the level of the spell slot you used to cast the
spell. While the bonus from this spell is +2 or
higher, your spell attacks deal an extra 1d4 force
damage on a hit.

***At Higher Levels.***  If you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial bonus
improves by +1 for each spell level above 3rd.
