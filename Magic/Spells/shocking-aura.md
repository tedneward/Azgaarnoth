For the duration, the area is filled with latent electrical charges, filling the air with a faint humming noise. Whenever a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. You can choose to exempt any number of creatures from this effect.

If you would be hit by a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to strike the projectile with lightning. A nonmagical projectile is destroyed, while a magical projectile is deflected harmlessly out of the air.
