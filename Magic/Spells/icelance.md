A large spear-like shard of ice appears in the air
next to you. Choose a target within range, and make
a ranged spell attack. If the attack hits, the target
takes 3d6 piercing damage, and 3d6 cold damage. In
addition, the target must make a Constitution
saving throw, or be stunned until the end of its next
turn.  
***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the amount of cold
and piercing damage both increase by 1d6 for each
slot level above 3rd.
