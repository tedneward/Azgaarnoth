#### Still Wind
*3rd-level evocation* *(ritual)* (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You suppress the movement of air within a 30-foot sphere that moves with you at the center. Winds that enter or are generated within the sphere immediately dispersed by countering energy of equal force. Effects that involve projecting air such as from a white dragon’s breath weapon or a cone of cold spell are also dispersed (spell durations continue as normal within the sphere). A spell’s effect can only be suppressed by this spell if it is 4th level or lower.

If you cast this spell as a ritual using a lead ornament worth at least 60 gp as a material component (consumed in the casting), you can make the effect permanent until dispelled, centered on the space that you are occupying when you cast the spell (it doesn’t move with you in this case).
