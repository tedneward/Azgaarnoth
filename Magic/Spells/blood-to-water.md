You vomit up a blob of sickly green water. It hovers in air for split second before flying toward a target you choose within range. Your target must make a Constitution save. If they fail their Constitution is reduced by 1d6 and they are poisoned for 1 minute. If they succeed the spell fails. A poisoned victim can make a Constitution save at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success. The victim's Constitution is restored after a long rest, or by lesser restoration  or similar magic.
