*3rd-level evocation* (Bard)

- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, M (a medicinal herb)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
As part of the action to cast this spell, you perform a song of life and compassion that heals and reinvigorates the wounded. Every non-hostile creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you perform regains 1 hit point whenever it starts a turn (10 hit points if it listens to the song for the entire duration). The affected area moves with you. Creatures that leave or are left behind by the affected area stop receiving the spell’s benefit, and gain the benefit if they enter the affected area.

In addition, for the spell’s duration, every creature within the affected area has resistance to necrotic damage and can not be given new levels of exhaustion (this benefit is lost upon leaving the affected area).

As the song plays, you can not speak or cast a spell, or take any action other than moving or performing this song.

As part of performing this song, you can use an action to grant one non-hostile creature within 30 feet of you 2d6 temporary hit points, that disappear when the spell ends.

If a creature listens to the entire minute of the song without leaving or being left behind by the affected area, it loses one level of exhaustion.

Undead and constructs are unaffected by this spell.
