An immovable, 1-foot cube toolbox appears on the
ground at a point you can see within range. For the
duration, you can pull out one set of tools of your
choice from the Tools table found in Chapter 5 of
the Player's Handbook.  You can only have one set of
tools summoned at a time. For the duration, you
can dismiss one set of tools as a bonus action.
Alternatively, you can call forth useful tools and
items from the tool box, such as a shovel, 50' of
rope, a hammer, pitons, or similar. Each item
summoned can weigh up to 20 pounds. You may
have up to ten such items conjured at a time. You
can't call forth these items if you have already
summoned a set of tools as described above, nor
can you summon a set of tools if you have already
called forth the alternate items described here.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the weight of the
tools you can conjure increases by 5 pounds and the
duration is extended for another hour for each slot
level above 4th.
