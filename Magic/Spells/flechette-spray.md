# Flechette Spray
*1st-level evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (15-foot cone)

**Components**: V, S, M (a metal shard)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You create a spray of sharp metal blades that erupt from your outstretched hands. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The blades are considered magical weapons for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
