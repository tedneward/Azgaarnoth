Choose a creature that you can see within range. You magically thin the air around the creature while it remains within range, causing  the target creature to experience dizziness and reduced coordination.

While under this effect, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks. The spell ends if the affected creature moves outside of the spell’s range. This spell does not affect undead, constructs, or creatures that don’t need to breathe.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell’s duration increases by 1 minute for each slot level above 5th.
