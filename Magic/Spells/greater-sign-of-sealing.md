This spell functions the same as [sign of sealing](sign-of-sealing.md), except that it can be used to seal an open space, such as a corridor, archway, or room. The spell creates a magical barrier of force that repels any creature trying to enter or pass the warded area. In addition, doors and objects protected by this spell are strengthened, increasing their AC by 2, and chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide  for details on the hit points and AC of objects). Any object protected by the spell is treated as magic, and has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage from nonmagical sources.

If this spell is broken, an explosion occurs. Each creature within 40 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 force damage on a failure or half as much on a success. This spell cannot be bypassed using a [knock](knock.md) spell, but it can be dispelled.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of force damage increases by 1d6 per slot level above 6th.
