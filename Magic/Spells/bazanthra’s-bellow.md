---
The tortured Bazanthra channels its eternal pain through your voice, unleashing a shrill shriek of envy and possessiveness. Every hostile creature within range that can hear you must make a Constitution saving throw and a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed Constitution save, a creature takes 3d6 thunder damage. On a failed Wisdom save, a creature takes 3d6 psychic damage. Every non-hostile creature within range that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is ﬂooded with a strange feeling of belonging to you, and on its next turn must make a DC 10 Charisma check if it wants to move to any space that is further away from you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the thunder damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
