You place yourself or another creature you touch in
a permanent state of suspended animation. Until
the spell ends, the target falls unconscious, it is
immune to all damage, it does not age, and it
cannot die.
The spell can be ended with a dispel magic  spell
cast at 9th level, or a wish spell. If you cast it on a
creature besides yourself, you can also use an action
during your turn to end this spell at any time.
If the target is unwilling, it can make a Wisdom
saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.
