#### Flame Vortex
*6th-level evocation* (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny brass ring)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You cause a mighty tornado of fire to erupt, trapping your enemies in a hellish inferno.

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. The vortex forms with an interior radius between 5 and 20 feet (your choice) surrounded by 1-foot-thick flames, which are opaque. The vortex reaches 60 feet upwards, and the diameter at the top is double the diameter of the bottom.

When the vortex appears, each creature whose space is crossed by the flames must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 fire damage and is pulled into an unoccupied space inside the vortex (if possible). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not pulled in. A creature who is not pulled in, either due to a successful save or a lack of space, is pushed out to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of the flames (if possible).

A creature trapped inside the vortex can use its action to try and force its way through the flames to escape. To do so, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, it pushes through the flames and exits the vortex, unless there is not enough space for it or it does not have enough movement toleave. On a failed save, the creature remains in the vortex. In either case, the creature trying to push through the flames takes 6d8 fire damage.

If a trapped creature does not attempt to push through the flames and does not otherwise escape the vortex on its turn, that creature takes 3d8 fire damage at the end of its turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each spell level above 6th.
