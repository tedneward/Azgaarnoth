#### Revealing Stroke
*2nd-level evocation* *(brandish)* (Bard,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
With a large weapon flourish in a complete circle (no target required), the caster creates a magical dust that will swirl and stick to all invisible creatures within a 15' radius around the caster, clearly revealing their position to all that can see (i.e. have visual faculties). Hidden creatures are not affected. This dust will disappear at the end of the caster's next turn. 

If the creature(s) do not violate the rules for their invisibility, they will return to that state when the dust disappears. If the creature(s) leave the 15' radius, the dust will also disappear.

Any creature that enters the area after the casting, but before the duration ends, is not subsequently affected. This includes creatures that leave and return. 

The area of effect remains stationary regardless of the caster's movement.
