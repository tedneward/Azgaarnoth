You transform the contents of a page to appear
totally different. A map could be made to look like a
poem, a business ledger, or even a blank page. A
comprehend languages  spell doesn't reveal the true
nature of the page. You can use a command word to
reveal the page's true contents or speak it twice in
succession to end the spell.
The page will radiate a dim aura of transmutation
magic. If dispel magic  is cast on the page, the spell
ends if this spell was cast using a spell slot of 2nd or
3rd level, and the page's true contents are revealed;
however, if this spell was cast using a spell slot of
4th level or higher and the attempt to dispel its
magic fails, the page is destroyed, and its contents
are unrecoverable.
A true seeing  spell will reveal the true nature of
the page, but it does not give its caster knowledge
of any languages required to decipher the text.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot higher than 2nd level, you can affect one
additional page, and the difficulty of dispelling its
magic increases accordingly.
