Until the end of your next turn, you know the
location of any dragon, dragonborn, or half-dragon
within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover.
If you cast this spell again when you have already
cast it within the last minute, if you detect any
dragon or half-dragon within range, you must make
a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.

dragon or half-dragon you detect until the end of
your next turn.
