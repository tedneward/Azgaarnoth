Choose a 15-foot radius area within range. Any
living creature within the area must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature is outlined with a dark aura and it can't
regain hit points for the duration. In addition, the
creature can't benefit from invisibility while affected
by this spell. An affected creature can make another
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the spell's effect on it with a success.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the radius of the
effect increases by five feet for every slot level above
6th.
