- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot radius sphere)
- **Components:** V, M (a melee weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You strike a blow fueled by the fury of the earth, channeling volcanic energy into the very ground beneath your feet.

As part of the action used to cast this spell, make a melee weapon attack against a creature within range. If the attack hits, the target is knocked prone, and the ground within a 10-foot radius sphere centered on you becomes difficult terrain until it is cleared. All creatures besides you within the affected area must roll a Strength saving throw.

A creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 fire damage and is knocked prone on a failed save. If the saving throw is successful, the creature takes half the damage, and isn't knocked prone. Molten lava ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't worn or carried.

The spell's area remains difficult terrain until it is cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand. Firenewts and earth-based or fire-based elemental creatures (such as gargoyles or salamanders) do not take damage from this spell.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage and fire damage both increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
