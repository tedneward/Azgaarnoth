Your body softens and appears like crimson jelly. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits: 

* You are immune to poison damage and you have resistance to necrotic damage. 
* You can move through a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing. 
* Your hit point maximum can't be reduced, and you can't be grappled, paralyzed, poisoned, or restrained 
* You can use your action to expel a cloud of noxious blood mist from your sanguine body. Each creature in a 15-foot cube emanating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 poison damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one. A creature that fails the save is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.
