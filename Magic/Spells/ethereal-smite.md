---
The next time you make a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon temporarily transforms your weapon into pure psionic energy that ignores your target's armor. Instead of making an attack roll, you force the target to makes a Dexterity saving throw against this spell. On a failed save, the target takes the attack's normal damage and suffers its additional effects. On a successful save, the target takes half damage from the attack but suffers no additional effects that would normally be imposed on a hit (such as a rogue's sneak attack damage or a paladin's divine smite damage). This spell affects targets in the Border Ethereal as if they were on the same plane as the caster.
