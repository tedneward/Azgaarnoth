___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a cocoon of a death's head moth)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
You alter the appearance of an undead creature
with the touch of your hand, masking its undead
nature. You can make the creature appear as it did
in life, or give it the appearance of another race.
However, you can't change the creature's general
body type, but you could, for example, make a
zombie or a wight look like a half-elf dressed in fine
clothing. In addition, you can alter its height by one
foot, making it appear taller or shorter, and you can
make it look fat, thin, or anything in between. You
can add small distinctive features to the illusion,
such as a mole on the creature's face, or a braided
beard. However, the spell doesn't change the smell,
sound, or tactile features of the undead.
Another creature interacting with the disguised
undead can use an action to make an Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to
detect the disguise. The spell masks the disguised
creature from divination spells that detect undead.
To such a divination spell, the creature appears as
the type of creature the disguise emulates.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can touch and
affect one additional undead for every two slot
levels above 2nd.
