# Distressing Melody
*3rd-level enchantment* (Bard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V or S, M (an instrument)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You select one creature within range and sing or play a song aimed at disrupting your target, causing them to make a Constitution saving throw vs your Spellcasting DC or lose their focus, ending any concentration spell they currently are casting. If they lose concentration in this manner, they cannot cast a spell from the same school of magic until they complete a long rest.
