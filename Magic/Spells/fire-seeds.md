#### Fire Seeds
*6th-level conjuration* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (four acorns or eight holly berries)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You choose to imbue either up to four acorns or
eight holly berries to create either magical grenades
or firebombs that last until they are used, or the
spell's duration expires. If you choose to imbue the
acorns, then you can use an action to throw one of
the acorns on your turn; make a ranged spell attack
against a target of your choice within 100 feet; on a
hit, the acorn explodes and deals 4d6 fire damage to
the target.
If you choose to imbue the holly berries with this
spell's magic, they can't be thrown effectively, so
they are usually placed in specific locations and
then ignited using a command word. If you are
within 200 feet of one of the holly berries
when you speak the command word, it
explodes and deals 1d8 fire damage in a 5-
foot radius. A creature caught in the blast
radius must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a successful save, the creature takes half the
fire damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create one
additional acorn or two additional holly berries for
each slot level above 6th.
