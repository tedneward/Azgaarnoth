Your deity imbues a melee weapon you currently possess with an essence of their power and launches it at a foe within 60 feet. Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can see within range. If successful, the target takes the weapon's normal damage plus an additional 2d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice). The weapon breaks after it is used in this manner.

***At Higher Levels.***When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 1st.
