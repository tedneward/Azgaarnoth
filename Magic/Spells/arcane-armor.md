You wreathe yourself in weightless magical armoring crafted from plates of pure energy, made as a choice at the time you prepare the spell. Until the spell ends you gain the following benefits for the duration, depending on the kind of energy the plates take on:

* You shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an extra 20 feet.
* Attacks made against you have disadvantage.
* If you are critically hit before the spell ends, you can use your reaction to end the spell causing the plates to explode in a protective blast of the chosen energy type. The attack misses, and the attacker as well as each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become affected until the end of your next turn in a manner described below.
* Fire:
    * When a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the plates burst with jets of fire. The attacker takes 3d6 fire damage, and other creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take half that damage.
    * If you use your reaction to end the spell early on a critical hit, the attacker and additional creatures are blinded.
    * You have resistance to cold damage.
* Cold:
    * When a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the plates burst with bursts of ice. The attacker takes 3d6 code damage, and other creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take half that damage.
    * If you use your reaction to end the spell early on a critical hit, the attacker and additional creatures are incapacitated.
    * You have resistance to fire damage.
* Force:
    * When a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the plates burst with jets of fire. The attacker takes 3d6 fire damage, and other creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take half that damage.
    * If you use your reaction to end the spell early on a critical hit, the attacker and additional creatures are knocked prone.
    * You have resistance to force damage.
* Lightning:
    * When a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the plates burst with jets of fire. The attacker takes 3d6 fire damage, and other creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take half that damage.
    * If you use your reaction to end the spell early on a critical hit, the attacker and additional creatures are paralyzed.
    * You have resistance to thunder and lightning damage.
* Thunder:
    * When a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the plates burst with jets of fire. The attacker takes 3d6 fire damage, and other creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take half that damage.
    * If you use your reaction to end the spell early on a critical hit, the attacker and additional creatures are deafened.
    * You have resistance to thunder and lightning damage.

When the spell ends, the magical plates vanish.
