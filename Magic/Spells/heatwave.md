A wave of nauseatingly hot air swirls briefly in a 50-foot cube emanating from you that spreads around corners. Each creature in the area other than you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 4d10 fire damage, is poisoned until the end of your next turn, and gains one level of exhaustion. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage, is not poisoned, and doesn't gain any exhaustion. A creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if it has resistance or immunity to cold damage. If it has reÂ­sistance to fire damage or immunity to fire damage, it has advantage on the saving throw and it can't gain any exhaustion from the spell.

Any levels of exhaustion caused by this spell are removed from a creature when it finishes a short or long rest in a cool or cold environment. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
