*Transmutation cantrip* (Artificer, Druid, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute 
- **Range:** Touch 
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sand, dust, or mulch) 
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 
---
You alter the composition of one object that you touch, changing it as if much time has passed. Choose either three hours or three days. The object instantly changes as if that much time had passed. This can cause paint to dry and eventually chip away, cause concrete to harden and eventually crack, erode stone, make paper rot, etc. The rate at which the object changes is determined by its current conditions. For example, paper will rot more quickly in warm climates, and stone will erode faster if placed in the path of moving water. 

This spell can't cause damage to a magic item, and it can't affect any spells or magical effects.
