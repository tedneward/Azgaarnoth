You heighten the power of your spells temporarily by altering the ï¬‚ow of magical energy in your body in a dangerous configuration. For the duration, each of the spells that you cast is treated as if it were cast with a spell slot one level higher than the slot you spent for the casting. For the duration, you must make a spellcasting ability check every time you cast a spell; the check DC is equal to 10 + the level of the spell, calculated without the level modifier of this spell. On a failed check, the spell you are casting fails, and you take 1d6 force damage for each level of the spell that failed, calculated with the level modifier of this spell.
