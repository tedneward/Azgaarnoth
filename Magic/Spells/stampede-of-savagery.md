You call fey spirits to appear as wave of frenzied beasts, which washes over your enemies like a storm of fang and claw in your choice of either a 60-foot-tall cylinder with a 20-foot radius centered on a point you can see within range, or as a 60-foot cone emanating from you. 

Ten fey spirits taking the form of beasts appear in un­occupied spaces of your choice within the area. Each beast is challenge rating 1/4 or lower and is also con­sidered fey. A beast disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. 

When the beasts appear, each other creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 piercing damage, 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and 2d8 slashing damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. This damage is nonmagical.

The summoned beasts are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the beasts as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal comm­ands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th. In addition, when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, twice as many creatures appear.
