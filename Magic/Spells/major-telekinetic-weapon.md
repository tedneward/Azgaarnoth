- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You summon a simple or martial weapon weighing
no more than 20 lbs that normally costs no more
than 75 gp. It appears in your free hand, ready to be
wielded, and lasts for the duration. It is a magical
weapon made of your psychic energies. If you let go
of the weapon, it disappears, but you can evoke the
weapon again as a bonus action.
You can use your spellcasting ability instead of
Strength or Dexterity for the attack rolls of melee
attacks using this weapon. On a hit, it deals force
damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability
modifier, instead of the normal damage for a
weapon of that type. If the weapon normally has the
ammunition property, this version does not have
that property, but you must go through the physical
motions of loading it normally as part of the spell
(thus, a weapon with the loading property retains
that property as a telekinetic weapon). Attacking
with a weapon that normally has the ammunition
property creates temporary magical ammunition
that you use normally as part of the attack, but that
ammunition ceases to exist after the attack hits or
misses and any damage is inflicted.
Though it is no more delicate than a common
version of that weapon, your telekinetic weapon
manifests as a semi-transparent solid the same color
as your eyes. This weapon has the simplest possible
geometric shape it can have while still functioning
as the chosen type of weapon. At the end of the
spell's duration, it dissipates harmlessly.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, it gains a magical
+1 bonus to attack rolls, and inflicts an additional
1d6 force damage on a hit. When you use a spell slot
of 6th level or higher, the magical bonus to attack
and damage rolls increases to +2, and the additional
force damage increases to 2d6 (for a total of 4d6 +
your spellcasting ability modifier).
