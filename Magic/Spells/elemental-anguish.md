- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You extend your finger and point at a creature while muttering a guttural curse. The target has until the end of its next turn to move 60 feet or more from you.

If the target fails or chooses not to move this distance away from you, it must immediately make a Constitution saving throw or lose its resistance from one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder (your choice) for 1 minute. Creatures with immunity to the chosen type are instead treated as having resistance to the damage. A [remove curse](./remove-curse.md) spell ends this effect.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can choose another damage type for every two slot levels above 2nd.
