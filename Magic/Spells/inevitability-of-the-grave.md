---
You recite a deadly cursing dirge, predicting
impending doom for a creature you can see within
range. You place this curse upon the chosen
creature, and until the spell ends, your attacks deal
an extra 1d8 psychic damage against it. Also,
whenever the target misses you with an attack roll
during its turn, it takes 1d8 psychic damage, and
must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it
is frightened of you until the start of its next turn.
If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell
ends, you can use a bonus action on your next turn
to place the curse upon a new creature. When you
move the curse in this way if the newly cursed
creature saw the previous target drop to 0 hit
points, it takes 4d10 psychic damage and is
frightened until the start of its next turn.
Creature with immunity to the frightened
condition have resistance to psychic damage from
this spell.
