*5th-level conjuration* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a fossil)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minutes
---
You call forth the intangible but terrifying spirits of
ancient dinosaurs, who rise up from beneath the
earth to trample your enemies. You choose a 40-
foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder anywhere within
range to contain a herd of stampeding dinosaur
spirits. At least part of this cylinder must be
touching the ground.
When the stampede area appears, each creature
in it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature
takes 4d12 force damage on a failed throw, or half as
much damage on a successful one. A creature must
also make this saving throw when it ends its turn
within the stampede area.
While this spell is active, you must use your
bonus action on each of your turns to choose a new
cylinder of the same size within range to be the
stampede area. The center point of the new cylinder
must be at least 15 feet from the center point of the
previous one, but can be no more than 40 feet away
from it. If there are creatures within the new
stampede area, those creatures must make the
saving throw against the stampede's damage. If you
end your turn without having moved the stampede
area in this way, the spell ends.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 5th.
