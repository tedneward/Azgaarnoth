A bolt of white lightning infused with magical pain leaps from your outstretched finger to strike one creature that you can see within range. You make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 lightning damage and can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.

If damage dealt by this spell forces the target to make a saving throw to maintain concentration, the DC is incÂ­reased by an amount equal to your spellcasting modifier (minimum +1) and the target has disadvantage on the saving throw. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
