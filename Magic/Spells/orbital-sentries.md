You create dozens of Tiny ﬂoating constructs made of solidified, translucent, glowing force that ﬂy in constant orbit around your body and move with you; they take the form of orbs, blades, or stars, protecting you from harm as well as attacking foes. Choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage when you cast this spell.

This spell applies the following effects while active:

* Your AC increases by 2.
* The constructs shed bright light in a radius of 10 feet, and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
* If a creature makes a melee attack against you (except with a reach weapon), it must make a Dexterity saving throw; on a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 damage of the type that you chose when casting the spell.
* If a creature ends a turn while grappling you, it must make a Dexterity saving throw; on a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 damage of the type that you chose when casting the spell. The creature takes half damage on a successful save.
* You take no damage from [magic missile](./magic-missile.md).
* You can take a bonus action to change the damage type of the orbiting sentries to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.
