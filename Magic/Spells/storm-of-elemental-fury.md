___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 4 rounds
---
A furious storm erupts in a 40-foot radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. When you cast this spell, and again at the beginning of each of your turns until the spell ends, the storm produces one of the following effects, starting with the first, and then progressing down the list.

For the spell's duration, any creature must make a Constitution saving throw the first time it tries to cast a spell inside the area. If it fails, it cannot cast spells within the area until the spell ends. A creature that failed its saving throw can make another Constitution saving throw at the beginning of each of its turns. If it succeeds, it can cast spells normally again.

**1st turn.** The storm buffets the area with a raging windstorm. No creature within the area can make ranged attacks or be the target of a ranged attack. A Small or smaller creature caught in the storm's area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is swept up, thrown 2d6 * 10 feet in a random direction, and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per ten feet thrown. A Medium creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. A Large or larger creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or its speed drops to 0.

A Large flying creature that fails its saving throw is blown 1d6 * 5 feet in a random direction, Medium flying creatures are blown 1d6 * 10 feet, and Small flying creatures are blown 2d6 * 10 feet away.

**2nd turn.** Rocks fall from the sky, pummelling creatures caught in the storm's area. Each creature caught in the area takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage (no save).

**3rd turn.** Heavy rain pours into the area, automatically extinguishing unprotected flames, and extinguishing protected flames 50% of the time. Visibility within the area is reduced to 5 feet, and the entire area of the spell becomes difficult terrain.

**4th turn.** Gouts of flame rain down from the sky into the storm's area. Any creature caught within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14d6 fire damage, or half as much if successful.
