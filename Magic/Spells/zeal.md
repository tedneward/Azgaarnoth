You invoke a divine shield that protects you
while you close the distance with a chosen
opponent. Choose one hostile creature within
120 feet. Until the spell ends, opportunity
attack rolls made against you by creatures
besides your chosen target have disadvantage.
In addition, you can move through the space of
any creature that is not your chosen target as if
it were an ally. At the end of each turn, you
must be closer to the target than you were
when you started moving, or the spell ends.
The spell also ends if the creature is stunned
or incapacitated by any means.
