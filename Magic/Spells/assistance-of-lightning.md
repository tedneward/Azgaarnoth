#### Assistance of Lightning
*1st-level evocation* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
As part of the casting of this spell you ready an action, holding the spell until another creature you can see within 60 feet hits a target with a melee weapon attack, at which point you release this spell as a reaction to wrap the creatureâ€™s weapon in tendrils of lightning as it strikes. The weapon attack deals an additional 3d8 lightning damage to the target (which you roll).

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you increase the damage by 1d8 for each slot level higher than 1st.
