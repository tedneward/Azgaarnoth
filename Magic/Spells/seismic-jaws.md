You churn the earth, causing massive slabs of stone to crash out of the ground and slam together in a 20-foot cube centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. The area extends into the ground. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. Flying creatures and Gargantuan creatures have advantage on the saving throw, and burrowing creatures have disadvantage on it. 

On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 5d10 nonÂ­magical bludgeoning damage, is stunned until the start of your nextturn, and is knocked prone. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

Additionally, ground within the area becomes difficult terrain until cleared Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.
