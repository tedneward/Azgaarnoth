#### Effulgent Epuration
*9th-level abjuration* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You select a creature within range, and nine small
silvery orbs spring into being, hovering around the
creature and granting it strong magical protection.
As an action on your turn, you can transfer the orbs
(and their protection) to another recipient within
range.
When a spell forces the protected creature to
make a saving throw, or when the creature is
targeted by a spell attack, it can expend one of the
orbs to nullify the spell's effect on it. The protected
creature no longer needs to make a saving throw, or
the spell attack is absorbed. Afterwards, the orb that
blocked the attack fades away.
This spell only protects the creature you chose
with the orbs hovering around it. Other targets
caught in a spell's area are affected normally.
