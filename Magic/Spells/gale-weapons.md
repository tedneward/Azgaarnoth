---
One or two weapons that you are holding are enveloped in small whirlwinds. For the duration, the weapons are magical if they weren't already, and they also have a +1 bonus to damage rolls. This effect is suppressed for a weapon while you aren't holding it.

In addition, if you use an affected weapon to make a weapon attack on your turn, the attack gains benefits based on whether it is melee or ranged.

**Melee.** The attack's reach is tripled, but it counts as both a melee weapon attack and a ranged spell attack if it is made outside the weapon's normal reach. 

**Ranged.** The attack ignores disadvantage caused by long-range, being underwater, or the effects of wind, and the weapon returns to one of your free hands at the end of your turn if it has the thrown property.
