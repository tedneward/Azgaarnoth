#### Hungering Curse
*4th-level transmutation* (Cleric,Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a troll's stomach)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Choose one target within range. That target must
make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the
spell fails and the target is aware someone
attempted to enchant it. If the target fails the saving
throw, it gains no sustenance from eating or
drinking. The target can eat or drink as much as it
likes, but it gains no benefit, and suffers the effects
of starvation as described in the Player's Handbook
(page 185). The target may repeat the Wisdom
saving throw each day at dawn. If it succeeds, the
target may eat normally that day. The spell ends
when the target successfully saves three times, or
dies.
