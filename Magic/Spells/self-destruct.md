#### Self Destruct
*2nd-level evocation* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (ash from a lightning strike)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
---
You touch a willing creature, instilling within it a dangerous and volatile energy. When the target creature is reduced to zero hit points, a blast of energy is released from it. Each creature within 20 feet of the target creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The target creature can choose to use its reaction to willingly release the energy blast, taking 6d6 lightning damage itself in the process.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
