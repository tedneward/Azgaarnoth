A chilling force swirls around your hand, ready to envelop the next creature that you touch in an icy prison. Make a melee spell attack against a creature; on a hit, you deal 5d8 + 10 cold damage to the target and if the target is Medium or smaller, the target is trapped in a shroud of ice until it succeeds on a Strength saving throw made whenever it starts a turn. While trapped, the target is incapacitated and its speed is 0.

Every time the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d8 cold damage. On a successful save, the target is no longer trapped and the space that it’s in, as well the area within 5 feet of its space, becomes difficult terrain from chunks of ice strewn about (unless the ice has been melted or otherwise destroyed).

While the target is trapped, it is completely covered by a barrier of ice that has AC 12, 50 hit points, and vulnerability to fire damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you increase the maximum target size category for the trapping effect is increased to Large (the ice’s hit points are increased to 80 in this case). When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the maximum target size category for the trapping effect is increased to Huge (the ice’s hit points are increased to 120 in this case).
