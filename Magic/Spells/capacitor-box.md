wooden box and choose a password. As long as the box is closed, the spell has no effect, but will still be detectable by detect magic.  If the box is placed on the ground, opened, and the password said aloud, the spell takes effect. For 10 minutes any creature that comes within 10 feet of the box without saying the password is hit by a bolt of lightning and must make a Dexterity saving throw. They take 6d6 lightning damage on a failed saving throw and half as much on a successful one. Destroying or closing the box ends the spell. You must complete a short rest before you can cast this spell again.
