By carefully molding magical forces and altering their visibility, you produce a hovering, intangible, invisible orb of magical force in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If a creature enters the space containing the orb, the orb will emit a momentary ï¬‚ash of light and detonate, producing an explosion of magical force in a 15-foot radius. Every creature within the affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 force damage and is pushed 10 feet from the origin of explosion on a failed save, and takes half damage on a successful save. If the orb is somehow hit with a spell attack or magic weapon (AC 10) or is within a magical area effect that would damage objects, it detonates prematurely.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
