#### Conduit
*5th-level enchantment* (Artificer,Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** Special
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (up to 2 missiles)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You can channel a spell into an arrow or other
missile for later use. Upon casting conduit, you can
cast a spell of 1st through 4th level into the missile
by touching the missile as the spell is cast. You
expend a spell slot, but none of the spell's effects
occur. Instead, the spell transfers into that missile
for later use. The spell imbued into the missile must
have a maximum casting time of 1 action, and it
must have an area of effect.

Any creature thereafter can make a ranged attack
using the missile, and the spell is cast when the
missile strikes an object. The spell is cast using your
spellcasting ability, and it is centered on the object
that the missile strikes.

When you create a conduit in this way, it must be
used within 8 hours. After that time, its magic fades
and is wasted. You can have a limited number of
conduits at the same time. The number equals your
Intelligence modifier.
