Many thousands of razor-edged petals made of solid magical force surge forth in a swiftly ï¬‚owing wave. This wave of petals is created in a 30-foot wide, 30-foot high, 60-foot long line originating from a point of your choice within range. If a creature is in the affected area when the spell is cast, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 15d8 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 7th.
