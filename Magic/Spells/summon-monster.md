# Summon Monster
*1st-level conjuration* (Druid, Ranger, Shaman, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 round

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a small, lit candle)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon one giant centipede to appear in an unoccupied space on a solid surface within range. The creature disappears, returning whence it came, when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The summoned creature is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creature, which has its own turn. The creature obeys any verbal command that you issue to it (no action required by you).

If you don’t issue any commands to it, the creature defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. The GM has the creature’s statistics.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a higher-level spell slot, you can summon more creatures or more powerful creatures, as shown on the following table. The GM might substitute a different creature of the same challenge rating depending on the environment in which you cast the spell. When you summon multiple creatures, you roll initiative once for the group and they take their turns together.
