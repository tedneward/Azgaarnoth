Choose either yourself, a willing creature within range that has less than half of its hit points remaining, or the body of a creature within range that was reduced to 0 hit points or killed within the last minute and that has not regained hit points since then. The target must have blood, or else the spell fails.

A wave of crimson energy surges out from the target. Each creature other than the target within 5 feet of the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

This is a Blood spell.
