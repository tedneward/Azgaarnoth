#### Shooting Stars
*8th-level evocation* (Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a wax candle lit and held for the duration)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Three fiery orbs appear and hover above you for the
duration. As part of the action used to cast the spell,
you can launch all the motes at targets you can see
within range. However, a target can attempt a
Dexterity saving throw to avoid the fiery motes. On
a failed save, the target takes 2d6 fire damage, and
the mote detonates. The target and each creature
within 10-feet of the burst must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 5d6
fire damage, or half as much on a successful one.
Targets within 45 feet of the caster have
disadvantage on the initial saving throw.
If a target makes the initial Dexterity saving
throw, the mote misses and flies to the extent of the
spell's range and then bursts with the same effects
described above. The caster can fire all the motes
the first round or use an action to fire the remaining
motes before the duration expires.
