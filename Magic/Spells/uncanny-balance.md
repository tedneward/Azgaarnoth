#### Uncanny Balance
*Transmutation cantrip* (Artificer,Druid,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You magically sense how to shift your weight from
step to step, staying atop a tricky surface. For the
rest of the turn, you have advantage on Dexterity
(Acrobatics) and Strength
(Athletics) checks made to
move, and you do not sink
when moving over soft or
brittle terrain, such as
dust, silt, mud, snow, or
thin ice (though you
cannot walk on actual
liquid with this effect).
While this spell is active,
difficult terrain of those
types does not require
extra movement.
If you are already
sinking into soft terrain
when you cast this spell,
the spell instantly moves
you up to 5 feet towards
the surface. When this
spell ends, if you are
standing in a place where
you would normally fall or
sink, you do so unless you
have some other means of
remaining there.
