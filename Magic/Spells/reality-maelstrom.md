- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a golden hoop no less than 1 inch across)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
With a crack of lightning and thunder, a 20-foot radius spherical rip in space and time appears, centered on a point you choose within range. All loose materials weighing under 100 pounds within the sphere are sucked into the center of the maelstrom and transported to a random plane of existence. Similarly, any creatures caught within the sphere must make a Wisdom saving throw or be pulled into the maelstrom and transported. All objects and creatures sucked into the maelstrom are transported to the same plane of existence.

The maelstrom has a secondary windstorm effect that extends 40 feet from the center of the sphere. All unattended objects weighing 50 pounds or less in the extended area are pulled 20 feet closer toward the maelstrom's center, and then sucked into the rift and transported. A creature within the extended area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pulled 20 feet closer to the center  of the sphere. Any creature pulled into the sphere must make the Wisdom saving throw, being transported to another plane on a failure.

Each time this spell is cast, roll on the following table to determine the destination for any objects or creatures transported to another plane.
