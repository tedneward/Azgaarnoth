You conjure a massive spear of oak and skewer your
foe with it. Make a ranged spell attack against one
creature within range. On a hit, the creature takes
6d10 piercing damage and must make a Strength
saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 30 feet
away from you. If the target ends this movement
adjacent to a solid obstacle (such as a wall), the
target is restrained until the end of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the piercing
damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above
4th.
