A vertical column of intense flame erupts from the ground in a 15-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is entirely consumed, leaving behind only ash.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each spell level above 4th.
