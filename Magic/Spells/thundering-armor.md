You infuse a creature's armor with pulsing energy,
increasing its protection and knocking a single foe
away with an intense reverberation.
Choose a friendly
creature within range
that is wearing armor.
The subject gains a +2 bonus to AC until the
end of its next turn. You can also choose a hostile creature within 5 feet of the ally. That hostile
creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a
failed save, it takes 2d8 thunder damage and is
pushed 10 feet away from your ally. On a successful
save, the target takes half damage and is not
pushed.
You cannot cast this spell on yourself. The sound
of this spell can be heard up to 100 feet away.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the thunder
damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
1st.
