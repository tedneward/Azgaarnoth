You touch a corpse that has been dead for less than
1 hour. While you are touching the corpse, you can
attempt to draw out and view a memory that the
corpse may possess. The corpse must have been
alive to create the memory. Make an Intelligence
check and add your proficiency bonus. If the result
is a 20 or above, you can view the memory with
perfect clarity. No one else can see or hear the
memory. For the duration, you can use an action to
repeat the roll, and try and view another memory. If
you fail three consecutive rolls, you fall unconscious
for 1 hour.
