#### Quivaelyn's Sharpening Palm
*1st-level transmutation* (Artificer,Cleric,Paladin,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a whetstone)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You run your palm along a blade, and the magic in
your hand gives it a preternaturally keen edge.
Touch one slashing melee weapon. For the
duration, attacks with that weapon inflict a critical
hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Once the weapon inflicts a
critical hit, the spell ends. If the weapon doesn't
inflict a critical hit during the spell's duration, the
spell ends with no effect.
After the spell ends, the weapon retains a keen
edge for the next 24 hours, as if an expert
swordmaster had sharpened it with a whetstone.
