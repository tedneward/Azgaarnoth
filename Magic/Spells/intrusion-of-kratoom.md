- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You invoke the curiosity of Kratoom, which manifests itself through your magic as three tentacles of solid magical force that lash out at enemies. Make three ranged spell attacks against the same or different creatures you can see. On a hit, a target takes 2d6 bludgeoning or piercing damage and 2d6 psychic damage, and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pushed 5 feet and becomes prone. Huge and Gargantuan creatures are not pushed or made prone by this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you increase the number of tentacles by one for each slot level above 4th.
