Your force of will teleports an object a short
distance away. You teleport one object you are
holding to an unoccupied space within range.
Alternatively, you can teleport the object to a
willing creature within range.
You can either cause the object to land at the
creature's feet, or you can give the creature the
option to grasp it with a free hand, which requires
the creature to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check
with a DC of 11. If the creature succeeds, it is
instantly holding the object. If the check fails, the
object falls to its feet.
This cantrip can only teleport objects that weigh
25 pounds or less. In addition, it cannot affect
objects that you are not already holding when you
cast the spell.
