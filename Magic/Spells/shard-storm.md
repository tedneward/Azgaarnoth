___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a crystal or piece of glass)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You fill a 20-foot radius sphere with ghostly shards
of force and the sound of breaking glass. Anyone in
the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. On
a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 force damage, or
half as much on a successful one. At the start of the
creature's next turn, the shards continue to dig
deeper, dealing half the damage they dealt the
previous round. The shards disappear after the
second round.
