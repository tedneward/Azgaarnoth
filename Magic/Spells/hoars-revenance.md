In a grueling ritual, you mark one humanoid with the symbol of Hoar, the ancient god of revenge. Twenty-four hours after the creature marked by this spell is slain, they rise as a revenant. The revenant will remember nothing of its former life, and be filled with an all-consuming desire for revenge on its killer. The revenant will kill family and friends if they attempt to stop it from getting revenge.
