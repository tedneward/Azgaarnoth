- **Duration:** Instantaneous 
---
You step through the realm of stars, teleporting yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within range.

Immediately after you appear, a blast of light and magical energy courses out of the portal you stepped through. Each other creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 force damage and 3d8 radiant damage, it is knocked prone, and it is blinded until the start of your next turn. On a success, a creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone or blinded.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also teleport one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. That creature doesn't roll the saving throw. It must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spelL and there must be an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your destination space for the creature to appear in; otherwise, the creature is left behind.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the radiant damage done increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.
