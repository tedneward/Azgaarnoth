#### Disperse Reserves
*2nd-level evocation* (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You split your reserves of magical energy to enable the fueling of a greater quantity of spells. You exchange one unspent 2nd level spell slot for three 1st level spell slots (roleplaying note: part of this energy is residue from the slot spent to cast this spell).

The spell slots gained from use of this spell disappear at the end of a short rest or long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you spend another spell slot of the same level as the slot spent to cast this spell, gaining three spell slots one level lower than the spell slot spent.
