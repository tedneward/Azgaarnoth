When you cast this spell, you must choose one
target you have already hit with a melee attack this
turn, otherwise the spell fails. You weave a deadly,
glowing symbol into your target's flesh that makes it
vulnerable to an element of your choice. Select one
of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire,
lightning, or thunder. Until the spell ends, at the
end of any turn in which the target took damage of
the type you chose, the target takes necrotic
damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability
modifier.
