# Tamara's Rebirth
*9th-level necromancy* (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Pale Master)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (diamonds worth at least 10,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Up to 24 hours

You touch a willing creature that has 1 or more hit points, infusing it with a blessing from Tamara, dragon goddess of life, light and mercy. If the target dies during the duration, for any reason except old age, the blessing is triggered. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life at the start of its next turn with hit points equal to half its hit point maximum. As a bonus action on the same turn, the target can expend as many of its hit dice as it chooses to heal itself. Roll each die spent, adding your Constitution modifier to each, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total.

This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.

The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists. The target then appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of where it died.
