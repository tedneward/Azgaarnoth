- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You renew your fighting spirit when you bring
down a foe. You regain hit points equal to 4d10 +
your spellcasting ability modifier. If the creature
you reduced to 0 hit points to trigger this spell was
marked by you (such as with a spell like hunter's
mark or marshal's mark, or with another marking
effect like the Unwavering Mark feature of the
Knight martial archetype), you can also spend one
or two Hit Dice, as if you had just finished a long
rest.
The next time you make a saving throw during
the duration, you can roll a d12 and add the number
rolled to the saving throw, and then the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing
increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.
