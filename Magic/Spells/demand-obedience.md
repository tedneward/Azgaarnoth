- **Range:** 15 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You utter a primal word of command, forcing
enemies to bow down while your allies better their
tactical positions. Choose up to five creatures you
can see within range. Each one must roll a Wisdom
saving throw, taking 5d10 psychic damage on a
failed save or half as much on a success. Creatures
immune to being charmed have advantage on this
saving throw. Each creature that fails the save also
falls prone, and if it stands up from being prone
before the end of your next turn, doing so provokes opportunity attacks from any creatures that have it
within their reach.
If at least one creature fails its saving throw, every
ally of your choice with range can immediately use
its reaction to move up to 15 feet.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.
