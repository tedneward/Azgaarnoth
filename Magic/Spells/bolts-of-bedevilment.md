You cast magical disrupting bolts that prevent a
creature from taking actions. Select a creature you
can see within range. The target must make a
successful Wisdom saving throw or be unable to
take any actions until after the end of its next turn.
Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again
on each of your turns as an action, though it must
be against the same target. This spell doesn't
prevent a creature from taking lair actions or
legendary actions.
