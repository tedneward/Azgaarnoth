You shroud one creature that you can see within range in a protective bubble of rubbery force that has hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier and lasts for the duration. If the target would take damage before the spell ends, the ward blocks that damage and takes the damage instead. The ward cannot block psychic or poison damage unless it is dealt by an attack. If the ward is reduced to 0 hit points, the target takes any remaining damage and the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the ward hit points increase by 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.
