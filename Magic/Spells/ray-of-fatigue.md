# Ray of Fatigue
*3rd-level necromancy* (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A purple coil of energy streaks from your hand toward a creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion, and until the spell ends, the target suffers the penalties for at least 3 levels of exhaustion at all times unless it is immune to exhaustion.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. Exhaustion caused by this spell is removed from a creature when it finishes a short or long rest with food and water to snack on.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
