#### Sphere of Ultimate Destruction
*9th-level conjuration* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust from a disintegrated creature)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure a 5-foot diameter featureless black
sphere of nothingness that disintegrates almost
anything it touches. The sphere appears in an
unoccupied space of your choice within range and
lasts for the duration.
Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of
the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The
target takes 12d6 + 60 force damage on a failed save,
or half as much on a success. If this damage reduces
the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated, as if by
the disintegrate  spell. A disintegrated creature and
everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic
items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The
creature can be restored to life only by means of a
true resurrection or a wish spell.
As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30
feet. When you move the sphere, it flies, and you
can move it any direction you wish. If you ram the
sphere into a creature, that creature must make the
saving throw against the sphere's damage. If you ram the sphere into a Medium or smaller object
that is not being held or carried, that object is
disintegrated. If you ram this sphere into a Huge or
larger object, it disintegrates the 5-foot cube area of
that object it strikes. If you ram the sphere into a
creation of magical force (such as the wall created
by a wall of force spell), it has the same effect on
that magical force that it would have on an object of
the same size. Magic items are not affected by this
spell.
Whenever you ram the sphere into a creature or
object, it uses up 10 feet of movement for every 5
feet it moves through the space occupied by that
creature or object. No object or creature can be
affected by the sphere more than once in the same
turn.
