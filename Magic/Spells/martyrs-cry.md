#### Martyr's Cry
*6th-level evocation* (Bard,Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take in response to an attack made by a creature within range that inflicts damage reducing you to half your maximum hit points or fewer
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You cry out in pain at your wounds, and your
suffering weakens the enemy who inflicted it. The
creature who damaged you takes 2d12 thunder
damage and must succeed on a Charisma saving
throw or become poisoned and restrained for the
duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target
can make another Charisma saving throw. On a
success, the spell ends on the target. It also ends if
you regain hit points that bring your current total to
higher than half your maximum.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the range increases
by 30 feet for each slot level above 6th.
