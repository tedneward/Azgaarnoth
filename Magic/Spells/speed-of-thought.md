- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You marshal psychic energies to move with speed
and acrobatic grace. When you cast this spell, you
gain two speed points.  For the duration, as a bonus
action on your turn, you can expend a speed point ,
granting yourself all of the following benefits until
the end of that turn:
* Your speed increases by 10 feet.
* You have resistance to falling damage.
* Difficult terrain does not reduce your speed.
* You have a climb speed equal to your walking
speed.
* Opportunity attacks against you are made with
disadvantage.
* You add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3
feet to your high jump distance.
* You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics)
and Strength (Athletics) checks.
* You can move up, down, and across vertical
surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while
leaving your hands free.
* You do not sink when moving over soft or
brittle terrain, such as dust, silt, mud, snow, or
thin ice. This effect does not allow you to move
over liquid surfaces.
* If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a
creature and then hit it with a melee weapon
attack on the same turn, that attack inflicts an
additional 1d4 damage.
At the end of the turn, the benefits fade entirely
until you spend another speed point . If these
benefits end while you are still on a vertical surface,
or anywhere else where you would normally fall or
sink, you immediately fall or begin to sink unless
you have some other means to remain there.
This spell ends when its duration expires, when
you cast this spell again, or when you have spent all
your speed points . When the spell ends, any unspent
speed points  are lost.
At Higher Levels.  If you cast this spell with a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage
you inflict with melee weapon attacks against
opponents when you move 20 feet increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st. In addition, if you cast
this spell with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you
gain one additional speed point for every two slot
levels above 1st.
