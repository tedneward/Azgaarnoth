#### Summon Primal Spirit
*9th-level conjuration* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute 
- **Range:** 60 feet 
- **Components:** V, S, M (a totem carved to represent a specific primal spirit worth at least 200gp) 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 
---
You commune with an ancient elemental or fey, the one that most resembles the totem you used for a material component as interpreted via ancient traditions. If you have not already become one of the spirit's champions, this spell only lets you mentally communicate with the spirit for the duration. You perceive this as a meeting with the spirit that occurs in the spirit's home realm. If you can convince it that you are worthy of being one of its champions before the spell ends (DM's discretion), you gain the ability to summon it using that totem as a material component when casting the spell.

If you are already one of the spirit's champions when you cast the speli you can instead choose to conjure that spirit as a powerful avatar to fight as your ally, taking the form of a creature of challenge rating 12 or lower in an unoccupied space within range. The avatar is also considered fey or elemental (based on which type the spirit is) and it can speak and understand Druidic. The avatar is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the avatar, which has its own turns. The avatar obeys any verbal commands that you issue to 
it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions. 

When the avatar drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends, the avatar disappears, and the spirit remains in its home realm. It is unharmed and unperturbed by anything that happened to the avatar during the spell
