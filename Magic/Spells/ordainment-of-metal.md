Your body transforms entirely into magical resonant metal for the duration. Choose one damage type out of bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or thunder. You gain the following benefits while transformed:

* You are immune to thunder damage and you have resistance to all damage except lightning damage. 
* You ignore the effects of disease, exhaustion, and poisons. Any poisons or diseases already in your system are suspended, not neutralized.
* You gain a +2 bonus to AC, and your AC can't be less than 18, regardless of what armor you are wearing. 
* You are five times as loud, and any creature that sees you can hear you as if you were only 10 feet away. 
* You are immune to the [silence](silence.md) and [howling void](howling-void.md) spells, and to the effects of being in an environment with high or low pressure. You cannot be prevented from speaking or providing verbal components. 
* When a spell you cast deals damage of the chosen type, it ignores resistance to that damage type, and it deals extra damage of that type equal to 10 + twice the spell's level. A spell can't deal this extra damage to any creature more than once per turn.
