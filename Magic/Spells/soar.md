# Soar
*5th-level transmutation* (Artificer, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (an arrow or dart)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 120 feet for the duration. Until the spell ends, the target's flying movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and while flying it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, saving throws made to resist being pushed or pulled, and ability checks made to resist the effects of air currents.

When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature in range for each slot level above 5th.
