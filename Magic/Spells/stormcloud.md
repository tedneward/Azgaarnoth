You conjure a massive, swirling storm cloud overhead. The cloud takes the shape of a horizontal circle with a 100-foot radius, centered on a point you choose within range. The cloud is 5 feet thick and opaque.

Whenever an airborne creature comes within 50 feet of any part of the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, a bolt of lightning strikes out from the cloud at the creature. Such a creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d10 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature becomes airborne while within this area, it too must save against this spell's damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.
