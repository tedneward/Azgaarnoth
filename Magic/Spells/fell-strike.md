---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise, the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and the towering fury you display commands your foe to kneel. You can use your bonus action this turn to force the target you hit to roll a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 1d6 psychic damage, and if it is Large or smaller, it falls prone. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 force damage to the target, and the psychic damage the target takes on a failed save increases to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th level and 17th level.
