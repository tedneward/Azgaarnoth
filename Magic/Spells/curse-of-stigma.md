#### Curse of Stigma
*5th-level enchantment* (Bard, Cleric, Paladin, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 60 feet 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 
---
One creature you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be cursed for the duration. While the target is cursed, creatures cannot be charmed by it, and other creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw upon seeing or hearing the target. 

On a failed Wisdom saving throw, a creature dislikes the target and regards the target as unwanted until the spell ends, no matter how positively it normally feels about the target. This spell doesn't affect those who already have stronger negative feelings towards the target, such as those who hate the target or wish the target harm. When the spell ends, the creature is aware that its feelings were magically altered. On a success, it is unaffected by this casting of the spell. 

When you cast the spell, you can choose any number of creatures that you can see. Those creatures and any creatures that can't be charmed automatically succeed on the Wisdom saving throw. 

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 24 hours.
