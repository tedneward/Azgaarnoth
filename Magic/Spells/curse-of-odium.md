___

- **Range:** 60 feet 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 
---
You place a curse on one creature you can see within range to be violently hated. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become cursed until the spell ends. While the target is cursed, any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage on the roll if the creature is an ally of the target. On a failure, a creature must move toward the target and then use its action on that turn to make a melee attack against the target if the target is within its reach. 

When you cast the spell you can choose any number of creatures you can see. Those creatures, frightened creatures, and any creatures that can't be charmed all automatically succeed on the Wisdom saving throw.
