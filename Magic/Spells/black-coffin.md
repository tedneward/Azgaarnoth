The air itself becomes thick and heavy as a solidifying box of crackling black energy and magical force completely entraps a Large or smaller creature within range; intense gravitational and spiritual forces within the box converge to crush the engulfed creature’s body and soul. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw and a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed Constitution save, the creature takes 10d6 + 10 force damage, or half damage on a success. On a failed Wisdom save, the creature takes 10d6 + 10 psychic damage, or half damage on a success. If the creature fails one or both of the saving throws, it is restrained until the start of its next turn. Whenever the creature starts a next turn, it must repeat the same saving throws. If the creature succeeds on both its saving throws, the spell ends.

The box has an AC of 30, 250 hit points, and is resistant to all damage except for force damage and bludgeoning/piercing/slashing damage from magic weapons with a minimum enhancement bonus of +5.

A creature that is killed by this spell has its physical body crushed beyond recognition. The creature must immediately make a Charisma saving throw upon death or be reduced to remnants of spiritual force, unable to maintain its consciousness or be resurrected. Every 24 hours afterwards, the creature must make another Charisma saving throw, re-assembling into an intact soul on a success. After three Charisma saving throw failures following the initial Charisma saving throw (72 hours later), the creature’s soul is lost forever unless somehow brought back by extraordinary means such as a magical artifact or divine intervention.
