As part of the casting of this spell, you swing a melee weapon that you are wielding at the ground within your currently occupied space. A wave of magical force then erupts and rushes outward from the ground strike, threatening creatures in its path, in a 5-foot wide, 30-foot line. Every creature in the waveâ€™s path must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 force damage on a failed save, and half damage on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
