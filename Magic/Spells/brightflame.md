___

- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 8 hours
---
You enhance the elemental energy of a nonmagical ﬂame you can see, no larger than a 5-foot cube, causing it to burn longer and more brightly. The fire becomes magical and can not be extinguished except by magical means for the duration. The fuel for the ﬂame will not be spent but objects set on fire with the ﬂame will burn normally and nonmagically outside of the original 5-foot cube occupied by the ﬂame. The ﬂame will shed bright light in a 40-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 40 feet. When the spell ends, the ﬂame returns to being nonmagical, spending its fuel normally.
