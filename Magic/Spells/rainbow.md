You conjure a shortbow or longbow (your choice) made of multicolored light into one of your hands, which sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet and lasts for the duration. The weapon is a solid object that you can use to make attacks as normal.

It is magicai and instead of one bowstring it has seven different bowstrings made of light, with each made of a different color. When you pull one back, a magical arrow made of light of the same color appears upon the bowstring, ready to fire. The arrow disappears when it hits a target. Thus, this weapon doesn't require ammunition to make attacks. 

When you make a ranged weapon attack using this weapon, you choose one of the following bowstrings. Your attack deals damage of a different type based on that color instead of its normal damage type, it gains the benefits described for that color, and it deals an extra 2d6 damage on a hit.

**Red.** The attack deals fire damage. On a critical hit, the target is lit [ablaze](../Conditions/Ablaze.md) if it is flammable or it is a creature. 

**Orange.** The attack deals acid damage. On a critical hit, if the target does not have resistance or immunity to acid damage, it grants attackers advantage on attacks made against it and it doesn't benefit from any damage resistances until the end of your next turn. 

**Yellow.** The attack deals lightning damage. On a critical hit, the target is unable to take reactions and has its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.

**Green.** The attack deals poison damage. On a critical hit, the target is poisoned until the end of your next turn.

**Blue.** The attack deals cold damage. On a critical hit, the target is restrained until the start of its next turn, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute if it doesn't have resistance or immunity to cold damage.

**Indigo.** The attack deals necrotic damage. On a critical hit, the target gains one level of exhaustion. This attack has no effect on targets that can't be petrified.

**Violet.** The attack deals force damage. On a critical hit, you teleport the target up to 30 feet to an unoccuÂ­pied space that you can see. This attack has no effect on targets that can't be paralyzed.

In addition, while you are wielding this weapon, you can use an action to pull back and release all seven bowstrings at once, ending the spell and releasing a wave of multicolored light and harmonic sound in a line 60 feet long and 15 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 6d6 radiant damage and it is blinded and deafened until the end of your next turn. On a success, a creature takes half damage and isn't blinded or deafened.
