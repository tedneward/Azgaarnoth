___

- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
In a moment of quiet reflection, you touch a
creature and can take its pain or anguish onto yourself, temporarily suppressing one condition
afflicting it. The condition can be blinded,
deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. When you
suppress the condition, the creature is no longer
afflicted with it, but you immediately suffer the
same condition yourself for duration, even if you
would normally be immune to it. At the end of your
next turn, you can make a Constitution saving
throw against your own spellcasting DC. If you
succeed, the condition ends early for you, but it
remains suppressed for the original creature until
the spell ends. If you fail, you can make the saving
throw again at the end of each of your turns until
you end the condition early or the spell ends.
When this spell ends, any suppressed effect
resumes for the creature that originally suffered it,
provided that its duration has not expired in the
meantime.
