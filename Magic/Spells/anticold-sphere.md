This spell creates a comfortably warm 10-foot radius sphere centered on the spellcaster. Friendly creatures within the sphere are immune to cold damage. In addition, creatures made of ice or cold can't enter the spell's area; if such a creature is within the sphere when the spell is cast, it is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the sphere.
