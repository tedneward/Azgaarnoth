An intangible, hovering orb of light with crackling tendrils of lightning swarming all over its surface appears above one creature you can see. The orb follows the target wherever it moves. If the target takes any action that would harm you or another creature, the orb fires a bolt of lightning at the target. The target must then make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage. On a successful save, the target takes half damage. If the target teleports or is more than 100 feet away from you, the orb above it disappears and the spell ends.

If the orb would be subjected to a damaging magical effect or hit with a magic weapon (AC 10), it is destroyed. If the orb is destroyed, the spell ends.

If a target touches the orb or hits it with a metal weapon, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage. On a successful save, the target takes half damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a slot of 5th level or higher, then you increase the number of targets by one for each slot level above 4th.
