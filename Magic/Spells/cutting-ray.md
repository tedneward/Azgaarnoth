#### Cutting Ray
*2nd-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A ray of slashing magical force is shot from your hand, and it lingers just long enough for you to brieï¬‚y make a slicing motion with it. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature, object, or structure. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 force damage and 3d6 slashing damage. Objects and structures take double damage from the ray.

If the ray deals damage to an unattended nonmagical object or structure, the ray produces a 1/4-inch diameter gash through the object or structure, with 1 inch of depth for every 5 points of total damage dealt.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you increase the slashing damage by 2d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
