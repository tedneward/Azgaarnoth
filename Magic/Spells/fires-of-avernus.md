# Fires of Avernus
*5th-level evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (60-foot cone)

**Components**: V, S, M (a chunk of basalt)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Crackling hellish flame and acrid smoke pour forth from your hands, engulfing a 60-foot cone area of your choice. Creatures within the area of effect must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or take 10d6 fire damage and become incapacitated until the end of their next turn, as their lungs fill with the poisonous smoke. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t incapacitated. Creatures immune to poison are immune to the incapacitating effects of this spell.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
