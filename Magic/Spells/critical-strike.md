#### Critical Strike
*1st-level divination* (Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take in response to hitting a target with a melee weapon attack
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
When you cast this spell, it takes effect after you hit
with the triggering attack but before you roll
damage. Whenever you hit with a melee attack
before the end of your next turn (including on the
triggering attack), your weapon inflicts an extra die
of its normal damage, and you score a critical hit on
a roll of 19 or 20.

For example, if you rolled a 19 to hit an enemy
with a longsword, you could cast critical strike  as a
reaction, and make the attack a critical hit. You
would then roll an amount of slashing damage
equal to 4d8 + your Strength modifier (the spell
increases longsword damage from 1d8 to 2d8, and
that is doubled again due to the critical hit).

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the weapon
damage increases by 1 die for every two slot levels
above 1st.
