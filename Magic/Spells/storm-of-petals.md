___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet

You cause thousands of tiny, ﬂoating, petal-shaped shards of magical force to appear in a 30-foot radius sphere at a point of your choice you can see. The petals proceed to whirl around the sphere’s center, harming creatures in the affected area with their razor sharp edges. Every creature in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d8 slashing damage on a failed save, and half damage on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.
