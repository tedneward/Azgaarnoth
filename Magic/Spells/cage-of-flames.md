You construct a prison of ﬂames that appears around one or more creatures you can see within a vertically-oriented 10-foot radius, 20-foot long cylinder. The cylinder can be set on a solid surface with no ﬂoor.The creature(s) is surrounded on all sides by bars made of ﬂames, with 3-inch spaces between. If a creature is too large to fit into the prison, the spell ends. The prison disappears when the spell ends. The prison remains fixed in space for the duration even if created in midair. The prison does not have a ﬂoor if oriented upon the ground.

If a creature attempts to enter or exit the prison, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, and half damage on a success. In addition (regardless of the save result), the creature is set on fire, taking an additional 2d6 fire damage whenever it ends its turn unless it succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check made as an action to put out the ﬂames on its body .The prison sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

If cast as a ritual, the spell’s material component is replaced by a ruby worth at least 50 gp, which is consumed in the casting. The prison becomes permanent until dispelled and no longer requires concentration to maintain if the spell is cast as a ritual. Additional castings of the spell as a ritual can further expand the size of the prison instead of creating new prisons. If cast as a ritual, you can establish a spoken password to enable the prison to form an opening large enough for Large or smaller creatures to enter and exit the prison; the same password closes the opening.
