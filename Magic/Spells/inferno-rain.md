#### Inferno Rain
*8th-level conjuration* (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 200 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure a swirling cloud of fiery wrath 
overhead, which rains down fire selectively on your 
enemies. The cloud is a 5-foot-thick horizontal disk 
with a 100-foot radius centered on a point you can 
see within range at least 20 feet above you. The spell
fails if there is not enough room to accommodate 
the cloud, although the cloud can spread around 
corners, and weak barriers (such as windows) are 
destroyed and broken through as it appears.

When the cloud appears and as an action on each 
of your turns until the spell ends, streams of fire rain
down on a number of points beneath the cloud up 
to your spellcasting ability modifier. A creature 
struck by a stream of fire must make a Dexterity 
saving throw, taking 10d8 fire damage on a failed 
save or half as much damage on a successful one.
