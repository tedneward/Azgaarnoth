- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Choose one creature within range, which must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect. On a failure, the next time the target tries to cast a spell, it backfires horribly. The target takes 1d8 fire damage for every level of the spell slot use to cast it (or for every level of the spell itself, if a spell slot is not used).
