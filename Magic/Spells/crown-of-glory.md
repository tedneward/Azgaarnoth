#### Crown of Glory
*8th-level enchantment* (Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
When you cast this spell, the magnificence of your
deity emanates from you in an aura that makes you
appear larger than life and bolsters nearby allies.
For the duration, any creature friendly to you
(including you) gains immunity to being frightened
and advantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and
saving throws while it is within 10 feet of you. If a
creature friendly to you is within 10 feet of you
when you first cast the spell, it also gains 10
temporary hit points.
The aura is centered on you, but if you move
more than half your speed in a single turn, the spell
ends early.
