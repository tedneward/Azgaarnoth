You evoke brilliant explosions of light coupled with loud bursts of noise. For the duration, on each of your turns, you can use an action to produce a single explosion of light of any color you desire, with a radius you desire from 10 feet to 30 feet, in any location within the affected area; the light is accompanied by a thunderous sound. Any Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of a point that you designate for an explosion must make two Constitution saving throws, one for the light and one for the sound. On a failed save for the light, the creature is blinded until the start of your next turn. On a failed save for the sound, the creature is deafened until the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a slot of 6th level or higher, you can create an additional explosion on your action for each slot level higher than 5th.
