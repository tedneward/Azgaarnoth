You create three ﬂoating rings of intangible luminescence that ﬂow in constant orbit around your body and move with you.

This spell applies the following effects while active:

* The rings produce bright light out to 30 feet, and dim light for another 30 feet.
* If a creature makes a melee attack (except with a reach weapon) against you, grapples you, or shoves you, it must make a Constitution saving throw; the creature takes 2d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save.
* If a creature ends a turn while grappling you, it must make a Constitution saving throw; on a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage. The creature takes half damage on a successful save.
* You can use a bonus action to brieﬂy expand the orbit of the rings before they immediately contract to their original orbit. Every creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw when you do this. A creature takes 2d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one.
* If you step into an area of magical darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the darkness is suppressed within a 10-foot radius of you.
