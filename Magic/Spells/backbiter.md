---
You place a dark curse on an enemy that causes its own weapons to work against it. Choose a creature you can see within range. The creature must roll a Wisdom saving throw. It takes 2d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. In addition, if the creature failed the saving throw, it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The first time the creature makes a weapon attack and misses before the end of its next turn, it inflicts the same damage on itself that it would have inflicted on its target.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
