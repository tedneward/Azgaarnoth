appears in your hand. Any time during the spells
duration you can use an action to throw the orb at
any point within range. The orb burst and a 15 foot
diameter cloud of acidic vapors fills the area. The
cloud moves around corners. The cloud lasts for one
minute and does not require concentration, or until
it is dispelled by a strong wind. Its area is heavily
obscured. Any creature that moves into the cloud or
starts its turn there must make a Dexterity saving
throw. Creatures take 5d6 acid damage on a failed
save, and half as much on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d6 for each spell level above 3rd.
