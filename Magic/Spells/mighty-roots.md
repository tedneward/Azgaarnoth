___

- **Range:** 60 feet 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
---
You conjure up to three thick and powerful plant roots, sprouting from the ground in unoccupied spaces you can see within range. The roots are Large and last for the duration, acting like giant tentacles. 

Each root is an object with AC 16 and 120 hit points that can't be pushed or pulled out of its space. Each root has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 18 (+4). If a root drops to O hit points, it is destroyed. If all the roots 
are destroyed, the spell ends. 

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can choose to cause one of the following effects with each of the roots. The roots do not have to perform the same actions as each other. If a creature is in the area of multiple effects, you choose which root it is affected by.

**Grab.** The root attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller target within 15 feet of it, using its own statistics. If the target is Large or smaller, the root has advantage. At the start of each of your turns, you can choose to deal any target grabbed by the roots Sd6 bludgeoning damage. 

**Slam.** The root slams into the ground. Each creature in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from the root must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 7d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. 

**Sweep.** The root sweeps along the ground in an arc. Each creature on the ground in a 30-foot cone emitted from the root must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. 

**Throw.** The root hurls whatever it has grabbed up to 60 feet in a direction of your choice. The thrown target is knocked prone, and if it strikes a solid surface, it also takes 7d6 bludgeoning damage. If it was thrown toward a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take the same bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
