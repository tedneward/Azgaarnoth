You produce a momentary burst of light that intensifies to blinding levels for creatures of your choice within 30 feet that you can see. Each affected creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until the end of your next turn. The light produced lingers brieﬂy as it fades, shedding bright light from your location out to a 60 feet radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet until the start of your next turn. This is treated as magical light. If any of this spell’s area overlaps with darkness created by a spell of 4th level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.
