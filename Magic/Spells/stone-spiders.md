You cast this spell on three small stone pebbles in
range, no two of which can be more than 30 feet
apart. The pebbles grow and turn into constructs
that look like stone spiders. The constructs can
grow up to huge in size. However, all the constructs
must be the same size. The constructs you create
with this spell are friendly to you and your
companions. They obey any verbal commands that
you issue to them (no action required by you). If
you don't issue any commands to them, they defend
themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise
take no actions. Each stone spider has the same
statistics as a giant spider , with the following
exceptions.
* Its natural Armor Class increases by 6
* It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage from nonmagical weapons and
immunity to poison and psychic damage
* Its poison save DC is equal to your spellcasting
