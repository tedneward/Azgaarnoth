---
As part of the casting of this spell, you make a ranged weapon attack with an unloaded bow or crossbow. As you aim the weapon, you create an arrow or bolt of solid magical force that is loaded to the weapon before you make the attack. If the attack is interrupted, the ammunition disappears and the spell is wasted.The ammunition deals the same damage die and damage type as the standard nonmagical ammunition, except the arrows and bolts created by this spell are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity.

If you miss on the attack, choose a point you can see within 10 feet of the target. Every creature within 10 feet of the target (on a hit, including the target) or the designated point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 force damage on a failed save, and takes half damage on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you increase the force damage by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
