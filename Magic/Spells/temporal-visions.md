# Temporal Visions
*6th-level divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a ruby gem worth at least 50 gp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Looking through the ruby gem, you gain a glimpse of the future. You can see (but not hear, smell, taste, or use any of your other senses) your current location through the ruby, for a number of hours into the future equal to the value of the ruby divided by 50. 

The information you gain is in the form of simple visions, so while you can understand that bugbears might be congregating at your location, you aren’t given specific information as to why they will be there. Due to the nature of the fl ow of time, creatures viewing their own future naturally change the outcome, and so the caster and any other creatures near the caster aren’t included in the visions. Casters of the spell understand that the information is symbolic and not literal.
