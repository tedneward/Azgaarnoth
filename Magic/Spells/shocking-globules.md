When a creature moves onto the affected area, it must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half damage on a successful save.The globules produce bright light out to 10 feet, and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can place globules onto another 10-foot square within range for each slot level higher than 1st. The squares can be overlapped; the damage taken on overlapped squares is 2d6 plus 1d6 for each additional square beyond the 1st.
