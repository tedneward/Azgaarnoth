___

- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a ball bearing)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You summon a 4-foot-diameter ball of crackling electrical energy that bounces around the battlefield.

When you cast the spell, you launch the ball at a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save.

At the start of the targeted creature's turn, the ball changes direction to launch itself at the nearest other creature within 30 feet. The new target must save against the spell's damage. This process repeats for the duration of the spell.

If two creatures are tied for the nearest, the new target is selected randomly from among them. If no new target is in range, the ball waits until a creature comes within 30 feet and then launches.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
