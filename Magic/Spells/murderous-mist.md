#### Murderous Mist
*4th-level conjuration* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, and up to 1 minute
---
You create a 30-foot radius by 20-foot high cloud of
scalding hot steam within range that moves away
from you in a straight line at a speed of 10 feet per
round.
A creature that starts its turn in the cloud takes
2d6 fire damage, and suffers from the blinded
condition for the duration of the spell. A successful
Dexterity saving throw halves the damage and
negates the blinded condition. A blinded creature
can attempt a Constitution saving throw at the end
of each of its turns, and on a success, the blinded
condition ends.
In addition, the area within the mists is heavily
obscured. Wind does not affect the cloud's direction
or speed. However, a moderate wind disperses the
cloud in 4 rounds.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the amount of fire
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
4th.
