A gentle, green ﬂame sheathes your hand but does not burn it. The ﬂame also does not burn anything made out of plant material.As an action, you can launch the ﬂame from your sheathed hand/weapon at a creature or object you can see within 60 feet. In this case, make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, you deal 2d6 fire damage to the target, unless it is a plant or made from plant material (plant-based armor, barding, or covering may count at the DM’s discretion). When you deal the fire damage, the ﬂame is extinguished immediately afterwards, but you can re-sheathe your hand/weapon with a bonus action.

Aberrations and undead do not benefit from resistance or immunity when damaged by this spell, and take an additional 2d6 fire damage on a hit.The sheathed hand emits bright light in a 20-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you increase the damage by 1d6 for each slot level higher than 1st.
