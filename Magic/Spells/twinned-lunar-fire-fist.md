# Twinned Lunar Fire Fist
*5th-level evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You pull the energies of the moon, channeling it into your fist, igniting it with blue cosmic fire, as you deal a damaging blow to your enemies. You make this attack at super speeds and are able to make a two punch combination. Make two melee spell attacks against one or two targets. You have advantage on each attack roll if the target is undead, or if the spell is cast under a night sky. On a successful hit, the target takes 3d8 radiant damage, and it must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone on a failed save.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every slot level above 5th.
