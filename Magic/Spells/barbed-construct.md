---
You hurl a small knot of inscribed barbed wire, which grows and springs to life, attacking your foes and protecting you from harm. The [barbed guardian](/Creatures/Guardian.md#barbed) you summon appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. It disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The barbed construct obeys any verbal commands you issue to it. Roll initiative for the barbed construct, which has its own turns. If you don't issue any commands to the construct, it defends itself from hostile creatures and uses its Shield reaction to protect you but otherwise takes no actions.
