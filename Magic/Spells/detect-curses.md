# Detect Curses
*4th-level divination* (ritual)

**Casting time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Your eyes take on a deep purple color as you gain the ability to perceive dark magic. For the duration, you know whether any creature or object you can see is cursed. If you spend 1 minute carefully examining a cursed subject within 10 feet of you, you learn the nature of the curse, how it works, and how it can be broken. You need not directly interact with the subject to gain this information.
