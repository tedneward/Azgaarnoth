Choose one creature within range. That creature
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If they succeed,
they experience a sudden chill, but no other effect.
If they fail, every creature they see looks like
grasping, clawing zombies. The target is frightened
of every creature it can see. If the target failed the
save by 5 or more, it is rendered unconscious.
