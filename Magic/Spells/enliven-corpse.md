---
You force an electric charge into a Small or 
Medium corpse, forcing it to move according to your
will. The corpse is not conscious and does not act on
its ownâ€”it's more like a puppet than an undead 
creature.

As part of casting this spell, and as an action on 
each of your turns thereafter, you can force the 
subject to move with a speed of 30 feet and make a 
melee attack with one of its limbs. This attack uses 
your spell attack bonus. On a hit, it deals 2d8 
lightning damage.

The corpse has an AC equal to your spell save DC. 
It has no hit points, but whenever it takes damage 
you must make a Constitution saving throw to 
maintain concentration as though you had taken the
damage. The corpse automatically fails all saving 
throws and ability checks.
