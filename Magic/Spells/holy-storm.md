___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a flask of holy water)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You select a point within range, and a loud and
blinding rain pours down in a 20-foot radius by 40-
foot high cylinder centered on that point. The area
becomes lightly obscured, and all ranged attacks
made by creatures within the spell's area, or made
against those creatures, are made with
disadvantage.
The rain automatically extinguishes unprotected
flames and has a 50% chance of extinguishing
protected flames such as lanterns. In addition, the
rain causes 2d6 radiant damage to any undead
creature that starts its turn within the area.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the amount of
radiant damage to evil creatures increases by 1d6 for
each slot level above 3rd.
