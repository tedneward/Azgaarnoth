# Curse of Combustion
*5th-level enchantment* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a fire-blackened chunk of quartz)

**Duration**: 1 hour

You place a magical command on a creature within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature understands you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 1d10 fire damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once per minute. A creature that canâ€™t understand you is unaffected by the spell.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases by one hour for each slot level above 5th.
