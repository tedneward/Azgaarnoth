___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, M (a musical instrument)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
The music created by this spell draws upon the
sadness, guilt, and despair of those around you.
Each creature in a 60-foot cone has disadvantage on
Wisdom (Perception) checks related to hearing
until the end of your next turn, and it must make an
Intelligence saving throw. A creature that fails the
saving throw takes 3d10 psychic damage and is
poisoned until the end of its next turn, as it calls to
mind memories of all its lost loves and
disappointments in life.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
