#### Conflagration
*9th-level evocation* (Warlock)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a wax doll)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You select a creature you can see within range, and
it bursts into flame. The target must make a
Constitution saving throw at the beginning of each
of its turns for the duration. The target takes 2d8
fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. All unattended objects
within 10 feet of the target catch on fire from the
intense heat.
In addition, if a creature ends its turn within 10
feet of the target, it must make a Dexterity saving
throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.
If the target dies while under the effects of this
spell, it is consumed by fire and turns into a fire
elemental under the spellcaster's control, which
requires concentration and lasts for up to 1 minute.
The fire elemental disintegrates when the spell
ends.
