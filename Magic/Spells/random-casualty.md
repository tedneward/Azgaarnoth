#### Random Casualty
*3rd-level transmutation* (Bard,Warlock)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction (after you or an ally has been struck by an enemy)
- **Range:** 50 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
As an enemy strikes your ally, you gesture and your ally is unharmed, but one of your enemies jerks as if struck.

When an enemy within range has struck one of your allies, but before they roll for damage, you may use your reaction to force them to make a Wisdom saving throw. If they fail the damage is applied to one of their allies. Determine which ally randomly. The ally must be within 30 feet of the target. If the target has no allies, the spell fails.
