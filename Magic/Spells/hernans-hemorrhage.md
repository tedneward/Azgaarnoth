# Hernan's Hemorrhage
*4th-level transmutation* (Druid, Ranger, Pale Master)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a target's previously healed battle scars to rupture as blood begins exit from these opened wounds. Select a creature within range to make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 slashing damage on a failed save. Additionally, roll a d8 for every two hit dice belonging to the creature. If this number is higher than the target's total hit points at the end of its next turn, it falls to 0 hit points. Temporary hit points do not count towards this total. If the target saves on the initial save, this spell has no effect.
