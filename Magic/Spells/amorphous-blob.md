#### Amorphous Blob
*7th-level transmutation* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a glass orb filled with the blood of a black dragon and squid ink, which is consumed by the spell)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You shake the glass orb as the noxious mixture inside starts to bubble and smoke. You hurl the orb at a point you can see within range. When the orb reaches that point it shatters, releasing a sickening form of ooze, a [black pudding](../../Creatures/BlackPudding.md). The black pudding turns into a disgusting puddle of sticky tar when it's reduced to 0 hit points or the spell ends.

The pudding is friendly to you. Roll initiative for the ooze, which has its own turns. The pudding follows your verbal commands (this does not require an action) to the best of its ability. If you don't give the pudding any commands it will move up to 20 feet towards the nearest creature that isn't you and attack.
