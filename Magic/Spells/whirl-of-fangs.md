You create an immobile curtain of snapping, serpent-fanged jaws shaped of magical force. The barrier appears within range, standing on a solid surface, and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the barrier up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The barrier blocks line of sight.

When the barrier appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 8d6 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save (rounding up).

The barrier is difficult terrain. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the barrier on a turn, or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 8d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one (rounding up).

You can move through or remain within your own whirl of fangs without taking damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level of higher, both types of damage increase by 1d6 for each slot level above the 6th.
