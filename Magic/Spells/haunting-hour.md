#### Haunting Hour
*8th-level necromancy* (Cleric, Pale Master, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 60 feet 
- **Components:** V, S, M (a chunk from a gravestone) 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour 
---
You call out to all the restless souls in the world, and six specters rise from the ground and appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. If you cast this spell on desecrated ground or in a location of spiritual upset or old death, such as a graveyard, a serial killer's home, a haunted castle, or the site of a dark rituaL you summon eight specters instead.

The specters are friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the specters as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures and attack the nearest living creature. Each specter disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. 

If your concentration is broken, the specters don't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the specters, they become hostile toward you and your companions, and they might attack. An uncontrolled specter can't be dismissed by you, but it disappears on its own 1 hour after you summoned it.
