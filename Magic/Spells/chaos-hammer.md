A shimmering hammer made of multicolored light
appears above you and slams into the ground,
exploding into a terrifying energy blast. Every
creature within range must make a Dexterity saving
throw. Creatures that are not of chaotic alignment
take 8d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much
on a success. Creatures of chaotic alignment do not
take damage equal to the total rolled; instead, such
creatures only take damage equal to the highest
number rolled on any one of the damage dice, or
half that much on a success.
Creatures that are not of lawful or chaotic
alignment (such as neutral or unaligned creatures)
have resistance against all damage from this spell.
Immediately after you roll dice for the damage of
this spell, you count the total number of those
damage dice that roll an even number. That total
determines the type of the damage, as follows:
At Higher Levels. You can cast this spell using a
5th level or higher spell slot. It does an extra 1d8
damage for every spell slot above 4th.
