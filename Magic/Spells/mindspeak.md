#### Mindspeak
*Divination cantrip* (Bard,Druid,Sorcerer)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You send a telepathic message to one creature
within range. The target (and only the target)
receives the message as your voice whispering in
their mind. They can send a telepathic message
back in reply. This ability to communicate lasts
until the start of your next turn. You can't
communicate with an unwilling creature.
Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less
aren't affected by this spell. You don't need to share
a language with a creature for it to understand your
telepathic utterances, but the creature must
understand at least one language in order to
communicate this way. If you cannot see or hear the
target, you must be familiar with the target and
know its approximate location with range. If the
creature is not within range, the spell fails.
