# Dimensional Reach
*2nd-level conjuration* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a miniature pair of tongs)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a small dimensional opening next to you, with a second one at any point you can see within 60 feet. Each portal is a single flat disk, up to 6 inches in diameter. You cannot move or change the facing (or size) of the disks once established. Any creature (or part of a creature), or object that enters either portal, passes through and exits through the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each other; and can then interact normally with anything within range of the other disk. Any creature (or part of a creature), or object that is still within either portal when the spell ends, takes 6d6 force damage and is immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space to the entry disk.
