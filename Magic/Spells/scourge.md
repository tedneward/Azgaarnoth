You touch a target with the tip of your finger, transferring a dark green energy that flows through your finger and infects the target. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage and suffers disadvantage on a single Constitution saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.

This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
