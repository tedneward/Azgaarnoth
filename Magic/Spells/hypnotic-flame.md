#### Hypnotic Flame

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
Choose a flame you can see within range, such as a torch or a fireplace. Each creature of your choice that can see the flame must make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature that is immune to being charmed succeeds automatically, and a creature that is fighting you or your allies has advantage on the save.

If the flame poses a clear threat (such as if the  building you're in is on fire), then all viewers have advantage on the save.

On a failed save, an observer becomes incapacitated and has its speed reduced to 0 as it stops to watch the flame for the duration. The effect ends for a creature if that creature takes any  damage, is attacked by a creature it can see, or can  no longer see the flame.
