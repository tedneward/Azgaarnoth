#### Wall of Darkness
*5th-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___

- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of blackened charcoal)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
A pitch-black wall of magical darkness appears at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free ﬂoating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight, but creatures and objects can pass through it. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.

Until the spell ends, you can use an action to make the wall form an opening within it from one side to the other (closing the opening takes another action).

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with light created by a spell of 5th level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
