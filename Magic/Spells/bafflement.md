You must make eye contact with a target creature that you can see within range. As you speak to the creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw.

Creatures that cannot be charmed are immune to this spell. On a failed save, the target can't speak coherently for the duration, nor can it cast spells with verbal components.

An affected creature can make a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.
