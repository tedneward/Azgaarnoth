---
A line of frigid wind 120 feet long and 15 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell's duration. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the line, that creature takes 5d8 cold damage and must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 30 feet away from you in a direction following the line.

Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.

The wind disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes all nonmagical flames in the area, even protected flames such as those of lanterns. Magical flames in the area are immediately dispelled.

As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.
