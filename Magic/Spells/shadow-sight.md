An inner light flares in your eyes, allowing you to
briefly see hidden things and gaze into even the
deepest darkness. Until the end of your next turn,
you can see normally in darkness, both magical and
non-magical, to a distance of 60 feet. For the same
duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as
if they were visible, and you can see into the
Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects
appear ghostly and translucent.
