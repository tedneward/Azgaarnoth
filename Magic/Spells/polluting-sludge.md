You conjure toxic gray sludge to coat the ground and all the liquid surfaces in a 60-foot cube within range. The sludge is 6 inches high and lasts until the spell ends. A creature moving through the sludge must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. 

Each creature that starts its turn in the area or enters it for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 4dl0 poison damage, and it is poisoned and can't move until the start of its next turn. Creatures that are prone and creatures that can't be prone because of the shape of their body have disadvantage on the saving throw.
