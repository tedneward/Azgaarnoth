This spell bolsters your ability to create and control
undead. For the spell's duration, the effectiveness of
your animate dead  spells is doubled. For example, when you cast the animate dead
spell at its base level (3rd), you can animate two
undead creatures, or reassert control over up to
eight. Likewise, when you cast animate dead  using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate or
reassert control over four more undead creatures
for each slot level above 3rd.
