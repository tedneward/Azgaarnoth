# Positive Foundations
*1st-level enchantment* (Shaman, Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: S, M (a personal, treasured childhood possession)

**Duration**: 10 minutes

You select a single creature within range and, with a smile and some gentle, neutral gestures, influence their emotions just enough to  put them at ease in your presence. This is not a charm, it merely reduces suspicion, and enhances their willingness to be receptive to your positive interactions. The target creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become indifferent toward you (if they were hostile) and open to dialogue. For the duration, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks, but disadvantage on Charisma (Deception) checks. This spell grants you no influence on the creature but removes social and emotional impediments to interaction. If you act in ways counter to the targetâ€™s interests or natural inclinations, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
