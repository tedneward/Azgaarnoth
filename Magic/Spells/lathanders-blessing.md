# Lathander's Blessing
*4th-level abjuration* (Cleric, Paladin)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Up to 1 minute

You invoke the blessing of the god of birth and renewal to aid you in your quest by protecting you against being slain by your foes. For the duration, if a single attack would knock you unconscious or kill you outright, you are instead lowered to 1 hit point and may roll 4d6 and receive that many temporary hit points.
