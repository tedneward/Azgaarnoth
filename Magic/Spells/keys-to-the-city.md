---
You know how to say the right things to get the best
reaction from the right people, especially when
those people are city officials. The next time you
make a Charisma (Performance or Persuasion)
check during this spell's duration, you have
advantage on the d20 roll. If you are within 100 feet
of any settlement that has a population of at least 25
humanoids when you make the Charisma check,
you can also reroll one of the dice once. As soon as
the Charisma check is resolved, the spell ends.
