---
You become magically attuned to the earth and ground around you, enabling you to traverse it like a fish in water.

Until the spell ends, you have [tremorsense](../../GameNotes.md#tremorsense) that extends out to 60 feet around you, you gain a [burrowing speed](../../GameNotes.md#burrow) of 60 feet, and you can hold your breath for 10 times the normal limit.

While burrowing using this spell you can use an action on your turn to make a melee spell attack against another creature that is above the ground within 5 feet of you. On a hit, if the target doesn't have a burrowing speed, you pull the target's legs (or similar appendages) beneath the ground, causing them to become grappled (escape DC equal to your spell saving throw DC) and restrained while grappled, though it is not a magical effect, and they are grappled by the earth, not a creature or spell.

If this spell ends while you are still underground and you lack a burrowing speed, you become trapped underground until you are excavated or you manage some way out on your own. The effects are as if you had a [living burial](living-burial.md) spell cast on you to completion, described here:

> A creature that is fully buried under the ground by this spell suffers the following effects:
> * The target is blinded, deafened, and cannot use blindsight.
> * The target cannot breathe or provide somatic components. If the target normally needs to breathe, it also cannot speak or provide verbal components, it has disadvantage on Concentration checks, and it must hold its breath or suffocate.
> * The target is grappled (escape DC equal to your spell saving throw DC) and restrained (by the ground/earth, not any creature or spell).
> * The target has total cover from every direction, and everything has total cover from the target, since the target is surrounded by densely compressed earth on all sides.
> * At the end of each of the target's turns while the spell lasts, it takes 6d6 nonmagical bludgeoning damage.
