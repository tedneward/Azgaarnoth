You blast one creature or object that you can see within range with a spiraling beam of thundrous sound that crashes over the target, bursting and spraying beyond it. You make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 12d4 thunder damage.

In addition, hit or miss, the blast sprays around the target, creating a 60-foot cone of electric spray originating from the space just in front of the target. The cone is facing away from you and must include the target in the area. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 12d4 lightning damage, or half as much damage on a successful saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.***When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the acid damage dealt (for both parts) increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 7th.
