# Glacious
*2nd-level evocation* (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The ground freezes in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature that starts its turn or moves into the area for the first time must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 cold damage and gain one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not suffer exhaustion. Creatures resistant or immune to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
