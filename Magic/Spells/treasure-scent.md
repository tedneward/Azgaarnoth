You can smell any copper, silver, gold, electrum,
platinum, or gems within 30 feet of you. If you are
more than 5 feet away from the treasure, you only
gain a sense of its direction. Once you are within 5
feet, you can determine what types of valuables
(copper, gold, opals, etc.) are present, and the
treasure's exact location. This spell is blocked by 1
inch of metal, 1 foot of stone, or 3 feet of earth or
wood.
