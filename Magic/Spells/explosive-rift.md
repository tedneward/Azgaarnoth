You clap your hands together, sending out a wave of explosive gas and flames that blast outward in a wall emanating out from you in a direction you choose. The wall lasts until the spell ends. It is 5 feet wide, 30 feet tall and up to 90 feet long, but you can choose a shorter length. The wall's space is lightly obscured and difficult terrain. Any ranged weapon attacks that pass in or out of the wall's area have disadvantage.

Each creature within 5 feet of the wall when it appears must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make this saving throw when it starts its turn in the wall or enters the wall for the first time on a turn. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 8d10 fire damage and is pushed 20 feet away from the wall and knocked prone. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone.

This spell ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried, and the ground in the area is smashed by the spell's initial blast. If any ground in the area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-square portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the fire damage dealt increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 7th.
