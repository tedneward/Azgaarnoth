# Decelerating Slash
*4th-level transmutation* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 5 feet

**Components**: V, M (a weapon)

**Duration**: 1 minute

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, its speed is reduced by 5 feet for the duration, and it cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a miss, the target takes psychic damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1), and the spell ends.

For the duration, the target makes an Intelligence saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success. If it fails the save, the creature cannot take reactions, bonus actions, or the Dash action. This spell ends early if you are incapacitated or if you die. 

In addition, each time a creature fails its saving throw against this spell, its speed is reduced by 5 feet, and one ally of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you or the target can move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
