# Spare the Living
*Necromancy cantrip* (Pale Master, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You feed off the lingering fragments of life-force from the dying. Select a humanoid that has 0 hit points and is not stable that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Death saving throw. On a failure, the creature inches closer to death and you gain 1d4 temporary hit points.

Alternatively, you can target a humanoid corpse that has died within the last minute to gain this benefit. You cannot use the same corpse more than once.

You gain one additional 1d4 temporary hit points at 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
