- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You conjure a spectral spirit avatar of a massive blooming sunflower out of the ground at a point that you can see within range. The flower gives off bright light for 30 feet and dim light for another 30 feet. The light from this spell is sunlight.

The flower is insubstantial and cannot be touched or dealt damage, and it does not occupy space. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on your turn to mentally order the flower to blast either an area or a single target with sunlight. 

If you choose to blast an area, choose either a 15 foot radius cylinder with height 100 feet centered on the flower, a 40 foot cone originating from the flower, or a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide originating from the flower. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this roll. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 6d6 radiant damage, or half as much damage on a successful saving throw.

If you choose to blast a single target, make a ranged spell attack originating from the flower against a target within 150 feet of the flower that you can see. On a hit, a creature takes 6d6 radiant damage, or half as much damage on a miss. You have advantage on this attack roll against undead and oozes.

When the spell ends, the spectral flower vanishes into petals and pollen on the wind.

***At Higher Levels.***When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
