#### Cacophonic Burst
*5th-level evocation* (Bard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You give a high-pitched scream that erupts into a thunderous 20-foot radius burst at a point you choose within range. Each creature in the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw or take 10d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell fails if cast into an area affected by silence. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area. The sound of this spell can be heard up to 900 feet away (or farther with a successful Wisdom (Perception) check as determined by your DM).

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
