# Attract Projectiles
*1st-level abjuration* (Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Paladin, Ranger)

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within range is targeted with a ranged weapon attack, but before the attack roll

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a spiked bracelet)

**Duration:** 1 round

You weave warding magic that attracts weapon projectiles such as arrows, javelins, or sling stones to strike at your defenses. The attack that triggered your reaction targets you instead of your ally, but you gain 2d6 temporary hit points, and while you are wielding a shield you gain a + 1 bonus to AC. This bonus and temporary hit points only apply to ranged weapon attacks and last until the start of your next turn.

Until the start of your next turn, your magic enables you to continue attracting projectiles. You can choose to make any ranged weapon attacks that target a creature you can see within 30 feet target you instead even if the attacker cannot see you. Projectiles attracted by this spell are pulled toward you around corners and obstacles, avoiding cover if possible.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the temporary hit points gained increase by 2d6 for each slot level above 1st.
