# Grimlore's Calamity
*9th-level necromancy* (Pale Master, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a shadowy pool centered on a flat surface that you can see within range. The pool is 30 feet in diameter and connects your plane to the Shadowfell. A spectral hand rises from the center of the pool and remains there for the duration of the spell. The spectral hand does not occupy its space.

When a creature enters the pool for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 10d12 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a success. Any creature that is reduced to 0 hit points while in the pool sinks to the bottom and is immediately transported to the Plane of Shadow, becoming trapped there.

Additionally, as a bonus action on your turn, you may command the spectral hand to beckon a creature within 120 feet of it. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or have an enchantment placed upon it, causing it to approach the spectral hand. The creature must spend its turns trying to move as close to the spectral hand as it can, using the Dash action.

A creature enchanted in this manner can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the enchantment ends and the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. If it fails its save three times, it becomes stunned and the enchantment ends. The spectral hand can only enchant one target at a time in this manner.
