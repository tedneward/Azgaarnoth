Your eyes cloud over completely and glow with a fierce silver light for the duration. Until the spell ends, you can see souls like colorful auras around each creature that has one. You can see a creature's soul through barriers and obstacles, even if that creature is invisible. 

If you can see a creature's soul, you can't be surprised by it, it can't hide from you, and you have advantage on attack rolls made against it and on Wisdom (Insight) checks made to understand it. You can see it even if it is invisible. You can see its alignment, its type, its challenge rating or leveL and whether it is charmed, frightened, or unconscious. You can also tell whether the creature is hostile, friendly, or neutral towards you, and you can discern its true emotional state regardless of its actions. 

In addition, when a creature with a soul dies, you can see its soul leave its body, and you can see incorporeal undead, such as ghosts, wraiths, or souls that have been removed from their bodies, even if they are invisible or on the Ethereal plane. 

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 3 feet of stone, 6 inches of any metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 6 feet of wood or dirt.
