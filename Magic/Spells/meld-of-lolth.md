This spell can only be cast on a willing target. For
the duration, the caster and the target have a shared
pool of hit points. Any damage done to either
character is subtracted from this combined pool. A
spell that effects that damages both the target and
the caster deals damage to the pool is treated as if
each character is using their own hit points. They
each make saving throws as normal and apply the
damage to the hit point pool as normal.
The caster may use their action to completely
control the target. The target may resist this part of
the spell with a successful Wisdom saving throw. If
they fail, you may use your action to take control of
the target like they were the target of a dominate
person. If the target wishes to end the spell for any
reason, it may make a Wisdom saving throw at the
end of their turn. The spell ends on a success.
