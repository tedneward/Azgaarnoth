- **Components:** V, S, M (the bark of a tree that fell on its own)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You touch a Large or Huge non-creature plant and fill it with animating magic. Until the spell ends, the target is a creature and uses a [treant](../../Creatures/Treant.md)'s statistics, except that it can't speak, it lacks the Animate Trees ability, and it has Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1. The spell ends when the treant drops to O hit points.

When the spell is cast, the target uproots, gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, and so forth, grows to size Huge if it was smaller, and gains senses similar to a human's. It is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the treant, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you} If you don't issue any commands to the treant, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

When the spell ends, the target stops being a creature and becomes inanimate once again, returning to its original size in the process. The plant then takes root in its current location if possible.
