#### Hell's Own Blade
*6th-level evocation* (Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bladed weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You hurl the weapon in your hand, which is then
animated to bury itself in the flesh of a distant foe
before exploding in flame. Make a melee spell
attack against a target you can see within range. On
a hit, the target takes 8d6 magical damage of the
same type that the weapon would inflict, and the
weapon erupts, forcing the target and every
creature within 10 feet of it to make a Dexterity
saving throw. A creature takes 6d8 fire damage if it
fails the saving throw, or half as much on a success.
The weapon appears to be destroyed in the
explosion, but whether you hit or miss, it
immediately reappears your hand.
