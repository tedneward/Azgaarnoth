You step into a fire and are immediately teleported
to another fire within range. Both fires must be the
size of a large campfire, a torch or even a small
fireplace will not be large enough. The caster must
have an idea of where the fire is and what its
surrounding are like. If there is no suitable fire within range, then the spell fails, and the caster
takes 1d6 fire damage.
