You make a melee spell attack against one creature you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 5d8 + 20 necrotic damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it gains two levels of exhaustion and is cursed with a dark malady. On a success, it is poisoned until the end of its next turn but suffers no other effects.

While cursed by the spell, the target is afflicted by an ever-changing medley of diseases that can't be cured or ended, causing it to be poisoned, blinded, and unable to regain hit points or reduce its exhaustion level. Also, if the target has blood, it has disadvantage on any saving throws it makes to maintain concentration. 

At the end of every 7 days, if the curse remains, the target takes 5d8 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion, and it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, it ends the curse on itself. 

Undead and constructs are immune to the spell, and it can't increase a creature's exhaustion level above five.
