You beckon the heavens to flood the land around you. Water rises from the lowest ground point within range. As the water rises and covers more ground, it begins to rise from any ground in the area that is lower than the water levei covering lower ground before higher ground. 

The water rises 20 feet each round until the spell has conjured an amount of water equal to 20 feet of rainfall averaged across the area, and then stops rising. While the water rises, it does not spill or flow like normal and stays within the spell's area. Once the water has stopped rising, it flows with gravity and spills onto the terrain outside the area as appropriate. 

When the spell ends, the water stops rising and starts to vanish, disappearing over 5 minutes. Living things do not receive nourishment from the water because it will quickly disappear from their bodies.

The spell fails if the caster is indoors or underground when it is cast, and any ground that is indoors or underÂ­ground is excluded from the spell's area.
