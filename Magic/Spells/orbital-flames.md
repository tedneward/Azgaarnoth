You create dozens of Tiny ﬂoating constructs of ﬂame that ﬂy in constant orbit around your body and move with you. This spell applies the following effects while active:

* The ﬂames produce bright light out to 20 feet, and dim light for another 20 feet.
* If a creature makes a melee attack (except with a reach weapon) against you, grapples you, or shoves you, it must make a Dexterity saving throw; on a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 fire damage, or half damage on a successful save.
* If a creature ends a turn while grappling you, it must make a Constitution saving throw; on a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 fire damage. The creature takes half damage on a successful save.
* You can use a bonus action to brieﬂy expand the orbit of the ﬂames before they immediately contract to their original orbit. Every creature within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw when you do this. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one.Flammable objects that touch the orbiting ﬂames will be ignited.
