You cause a small hovering fist made of fire to
appear at a point you can see within range, which
lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell
again. When you cast this spell, you can make a
melee spell attack against a creature or object
within 5 feet of the fist. On a hit, the target takes
fire damage equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability
modifier. If the fist hits an unattended flammable
object, the target catches on fire, taking 1d8 fire
damage at the start of each of your turns for the
duration.
As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can
move the fist up to 20 feet and repeat the attack as
described above.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage
from the fist's attack increases by 1d8 for every two
slot levels above 4th.
