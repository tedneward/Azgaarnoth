#### Marshal's Mark
*1st-level enchantment* (Artificer,Paladin,Ranger,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you hit a creature within range with a weapon attack roll
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Empowering your
voice and weapon with
unwavering authority,
you impose the full force
of your will on your foe.
You mark the target of
the triggering attack
until the end of your next turn.
This effect ends early if someone else marks the
creature, or if you mark another creature. While it is
within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has
disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target
you, and your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4
psychic damage to that creature on a hit.
For the spell's duration, whenever you hit a
creature with a weapon attack, you can mark that
creature until the end of your next turn.
Once before the spell ends, when you mark a
creature during your turn, you can use a bonus
action to cause the marked creature to become
restrained until the end of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can concentrate
on the spell for up to 8 hours. With a slot that's 5th
level or higher, you can concentrate for up to 24
hours
