You cause a layer of frost to form on a solid surface you can see, which grows almost instantly into a crushing ice formation. This wave of ice is created in a 20-foot wide, 20-foot high, 40-foot long line. The top of the ice formation is difficult terrain, and the formation remains until it melts or is otherwise destroyed.If a creature is in the affected area when the spell is cast, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 cold damage and 4d8 bludgeoning damage, is pushed to one side of the ice, and falls prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and is pushed to one side of the ice.

The ice is an object that has AC 12, 20 hit points per 5-foot cube section, and is vulnerable to fire damage. Nonmagical ï¬‚ames within the affected area are extinguished by the wave.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
