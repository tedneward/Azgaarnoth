You cause a teleportation spell to go awry, rerouting all targets being teleported to a new location. If a conjuration spell is cast within range, you can choose a new destination for the spellâ€™s target. The new destination must be a valid destination for the spell, as though you had cast the original spell. The affected spell needs to have a destination for creatures conjured, or creatures that are otherwise relocated, by the spell otherwise the target spell remains unaffected.
