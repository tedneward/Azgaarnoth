You alter the structure of your hand so that it becomes as hard and sharp as a blade. Until the spell ends, your unarmed strikes inflict magical slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and you make unarmed strikes with a magical +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

For the duration, once during each of your turns, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you use a spell slot of 3rd, 4th, or 5th level to cast this spell, the magical bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell slot of 6th or higher, the bonus is +3.
