# Dire Radiance
*Evocation cantrip*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 round

Make a spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 radiant damage, and a shaft of brilliant, cold starlight lances down from above, bathing your foe in an excruciating radiance that grows brighter and deadlier when the target approaches you. Until the start of your next turn, if the target willingly moves closer to you, it immediately takes additional radiant damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1), and the spell ends.

This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels.At 5th level, the additional radiant damage for moving closer to you increases to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d4 when you reach 11th level (becoming 3d4 and 2d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier, respectively). At 17th level, the additional radiant damage for moving closer to you increases to 3d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
