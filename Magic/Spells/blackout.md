# Blackout
*1st-level illusion* (All Except Paladin)

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a lit candle, which the spell puts out)

**Duration:** 1 minute

Until the spell ends, nonmagical sources of light are suppressed while you are within 20 feet of them, causing them to generate no light. This spell does not block light that originates from sources outside the range of its effect.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the range of the effect increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st. At 2nd level, light created by a cantrip-level spell is also surpressed. At 3rd level, lights created by 1st-level spells are supressed, etc.
