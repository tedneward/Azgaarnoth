- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You summon the strength and horrific majesty of a
terrifying princess of the Nine Hells to wreak havoc
upon your enemies. As part of the action used to
cast this spell, you can move up to 30 feet. For each
5 feet you move, you can choose one creature
within 5 feet that you haven't yet attacked as a part
of this spell, and make a melee spell attack against
that creature. On a hit, the target takes 8d6 necrotic
damage, and you push it 5 feet away from you.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the number of feet
you move as part of this spell is increased by 10 feet
for each slot level above 7th.
