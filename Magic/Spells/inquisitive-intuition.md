You create a magical memory palace, a mnemonic device that focuses all the information in your mind and allows a sudden flash of future insight. Once during the duration, when you make an Intelligence (Investigation, Nature, or History) check or Wisdom (Insight, Perception, or Survival) check and dislike the result, you can choose to resolve that check as if you had rolled a 20 on the die. When you do so, the spell ends. This spells ends early if you cast it again, or if you are reduced to 0 hit points.
