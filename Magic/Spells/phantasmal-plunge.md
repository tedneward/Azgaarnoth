# Phantasmal Plunge
*5th-level illusion* (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose up to 6 creatures that you can see within range. You fabricate a vivid illusion around each of them that your magic has broken the ground under them apart. They feel all the sensations of a sudden, horrible fall to one's death, though it only lasts a moment or two. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a target takes 5d10 psychic damage, it falls prone, and it can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.

On a successful saving throw, a target takes half damage and suffers no other effects from the spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can choose an additional target for each slot level above 5th.
