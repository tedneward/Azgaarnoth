___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a speck of glass or obsidian)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You cause a grasping, clawed arm of living molten
earth like that of a magmin to erupt from the
ground as grasp your enemy. Choose a Medium or
smaller creature within range. The target takes 2d6
fire damage, has its speed reduced by half until the
end of its next turn, and must make a Dexterity
saving throw. If it fails, it takes additional
bludgeoning damage equal to the fire damage
and becomes restrained. Creatures with
resistance or immunity to fire damage have
advantage on the saving throw.
While restrained by this spell, the target takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A
creature restrained by the grasping claw or one that
can touch the creature can use its action to make a
Strength check against your spell save DC. On a
success, the target is freed.
When a target begins its turn restrained by this
spell, all flammable objects in its space that aren't
being worn or carried are ignited.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can choose an
additional target for each slot level above 1st.
