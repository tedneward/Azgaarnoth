# Last Breath
*1st-level conjuration* (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a vial of water)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You raise your hands in a grasping gesture around a creature's neck and begin to fill their lungs with water. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 cold damage, and on your turn(s), you can use your action to deal 1d8 cold damage to the target automatically.

While the target is affected by the spell, it is considered to be holding its breath. The target can hold its breath for 1 + its Constitution modifier minutes (minimum of 30 seconds), then begins choking. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else or the target moves more than 30 feet away from you or dies. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.

This spell has no effect on creatures who don't need to breathe or can breathe underwater.
