# Blood to Flame
*9th-level (Blood) transmutation (Sorcerer; Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a vial of blood mixed with pitch)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You point at one creature that you can see within range and attempt to transform the blood inside their body into searing flame. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 8d6 fire damage and 8d6 necrotic damage and is set internally ablaze until the spell ends. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage and is not set internally ablaze.

At the start of each of its turns while internally ablaze, the target takes 8d6 necrotic damage and 8d6 fire damage and becomes poisoned until the end of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, it is incapacitated A creature set internally ablaze by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails saves three times, it instantly takes 8d6 necrotic damage, the spell ends, and the transformation becomes permanent - a magical effect lingers inside the target's body. It will be incurably poisoned and take 8d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns until it dies. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind

A *dispel magic* spell can end the permanent effect only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell

Creatures that do not have blood are immune to this spell A creature who dies while affected by this spell or by the permanent magical effect burns to ash.
