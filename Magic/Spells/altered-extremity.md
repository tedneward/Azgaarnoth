---
With a sickening sound as your bones stretch
beneath your skin, one of your arms extends,
becomes unnaturally long and wiry. Until the end of
your next turn, your reach with all melee attacks
increases by 5 feet, and you have advantage on all
rolls to make or escape a grapple.
Before the spell ends, you can give yourself
advantage on one melee weapon attack
roll. On a hit, that attack deals an extra
5d4 damage of the same type as the
attack.
For the spell's duration, you also
suffer disadvantage on Charisma
(Persuasion) checks.
