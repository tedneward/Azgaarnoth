# Ruin
*5th-level evocation* (Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a maelstrom of fire and brimstone in a 20-foot radius sphere at a point you can see within range. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d8 fire damage or half as much on a success. Constructs and structures automatically fail the save and the spell deals maximum damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
