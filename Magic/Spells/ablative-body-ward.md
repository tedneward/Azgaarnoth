*3rd-level abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (gem dust worth 50+ gp, which the spell consumes)

You are imbued with a sheen of glittering dust that guards against fatal blows. While the spell is active, when damage reduces you to zero hit points, you can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 minute for each slot level above 3rd.
