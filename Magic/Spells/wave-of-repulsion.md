#### Wave of Repulsion
*3rd-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You evoke a directional wave of invisible, repulsive force. This wave of force is created in a 30-foot cube, centered on a point you can see. If a creature is in the affected area when the spell is cast, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 30 feet from one side of the cube (you must choose the same side for all affected creatures). On a successful save, the creature is pushed 10 feet. The amount of forced movement is halved for Huge creatures, and Gargantuan creatures are immune to this spell.

If the creature’s or object’s forced movement is interrupted by impact with an obstruction such as a wall, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it still had yet to be pushed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you increase the distance of the push by 10 feet for each slot level higher than 3rd.
