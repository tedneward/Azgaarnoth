#### Bone Break 
*2nd-level necromancy* (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 30 feet 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** 1 round 
---
Dark magic suffuses your hand in an attempt to crush the bones of one creature that you can see within range. 

The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 necrotic damage, and until the end of its next turn, its speed is halved and it has disadvantage on weapon attacks. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. 

If the target is undead, it has disadvantage on the saving throw, the spell ignores resistance to necrotic damage, and it knocks the target prone on a failed save. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by ld6 for each slot level above 2nd
