You emit a brilliant directed burst of light, and every creature in a 30-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is blinded until your next turn. The burst of light brieﬂy sheds bright light in a 120-foot cone as well as within 30 feet of the cone’s sides, and dim light for an additional 120 foot extension of the cone as well as between 30 feet and 60 feet of the cone’s sides.
