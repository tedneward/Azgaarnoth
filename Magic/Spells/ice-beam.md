___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (an oblong bead of blue glass)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A beam of pale blue light forming a line 30 feet 
long and 5 feet wide flashes out from your 
outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each 
creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving 
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 cold 
damage, and until the beginning of your next turn 
its speed is halved and it can't take reactions. On a 
successful save, a creature takes half as much 
damage and does not suffer the other effects.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage 
increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
