---
You create a small time bubble that surrounds you and allows you to assault a target relentlessly. Onlookers see nothing but a blur of movement and uncountable strikes against the target. 

Make 20 melee attacks against a creature within range, treating the first attack roll as if you had rolled a 1 on the d20, the second as if you had rolled a 2, the third as if you had rolled a 3, and so on with up to 20, triggering any critical attack results if applicable. The target is partially caught in the time bubble leaving it able to defend itself, but it gains no extra actions or turns.
