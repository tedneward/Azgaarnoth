You conjure magical chains of elemental energy that lurch toward your foes to shackle them. Choose up to five creatures that you can see within range, and choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. 

Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a target is restrained until the spell ends. At the end of each of your turns while the spell lasts, you can choose to pull any number of targets resÂ­trained by this spell up to 20 feet closer to you. 

A creature restrained by the chains takes 6d8 damage of the chosen type at the start of each of its turns. In addition, it can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to one additional creature for each slot level above 7th.
