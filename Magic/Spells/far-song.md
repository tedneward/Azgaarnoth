#### Far Song

___

- **Range:** Self (5-mile-radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You warm up your voice or play some chords on a musical instrument as part of the casting of this spell. For the duration, whatever song or musical piece you perform (except for magical songs or pieces) will be heard by all creatures within 5 miles of your current location as if you were 30 feet away, except for listeners within 30 feet who hear you normally.

This spell can not be used to deliver sounds that would be directly harmful to creatures listening to it nearby. Any attempt to do so fails and causes the spell to end.

Any creature that hears the song or musical piece will be able to discern the direction from which it is being transmitted, but not how distant the source is.
