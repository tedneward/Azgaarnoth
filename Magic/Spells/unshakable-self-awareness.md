# Unshakable Self Awareness
*5th-level enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a mirror)

You select one creature within range, and positively fortify their self-image and self-awareness. For the duration, all effects of the charmed condition that the target creature is under, are suspended. The target creature is immune to the charmed, frightened and stunned conditions, and makes all ability checks with advantage. Additionally, they gain inspiration if they do not already have it, which can be used at any time during this effect.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th.
