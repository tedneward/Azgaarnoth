You touch a creature and impart it with specific
knowledge that you choose. The knowledge appears
as images accompanied with phrases from your
memory or from your own knowledge. There are
two different durations depending on the
knowledge you impart. For simple conveyance of
information, the duration is instantaneous and the
creature you touch can learn information that you
know about a specific person or subject.
Alternatively, the creature you touch can
temporarily learn one skill that you are proficient with; for 1 hour, the creature is also proficient with
that skill.
