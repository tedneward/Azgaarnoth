Make a ranged spell attack against a creature in range. 

If you hit, the creature must repeat their movement action from the last turn. For example, if the creature moved 15 feet forward and 15 feet to the right during its last move action, then it will immediately move 15 feet forward and 15 feet to the right.

The creature will not move into an area that is dangerous or fatal. The spell will end if the creature would be forced into those areas.
