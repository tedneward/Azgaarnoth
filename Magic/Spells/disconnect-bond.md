**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You disrupt the bond between a summoner and their conjured creatures. Choose a creature within 30 feet that was conjured. It must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or obey you as though you were the creature that summoned it. At the end of each of your turns, make a Charisma saving throw against the summonerâ€™s spell save DC. On a failure, this spell ends.
