---
A beam of red-orange light streaks towards a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 fire damage. On a critical hit, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has one level of exhaustion applied to it until the start of your next turn. This exhaustion does not stack with exhaustion caused by other sources of heat or fire damage.Large creatures have advantage on the saving throw. Huge and Gargantuan creatures, as well as creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage, are exempt from making the saving throw (they do not have exhaustion applied to them by this spell).

***At Higher Levels.*** This spellâ€™s damage increases to 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.
