#### Waterspout
*7th-level conjuration* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure a 5-foot radius by 80-foot high
cylinder-shaped vortex on a body of water, centred
at a point you can see within range. Any creature
that contacts the vortex must immediately make a
Dexterity saving throw or take 3d8 bludgeoning
damage from the high winds in the vortex. In
addition, if the creature is Medium sized or smaller,
it is sucked into the vortex and becomes restrained.
On a successful save, a creature takes half the
damage, and isn't sucked into the vortex or
restrained.
A creature that starts its turn restrained within
the vortex takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is
drawn 10 feet higher. A creature that reaches the
top of the vortex is ejected from the waterspout and
thrown 3d20 feet up into the air. A creature thrown
from the vortex takes falling damage as normal.
Waterborne creatures that come within 10 feet of
the vortex must make a Dexterity saving throw or
be sucked into the vortex and suffer its effects.
You can use a bonus action on each of your turns
to move the waterspout up to 30 feet and cause any
creature that contacts the vortex to make a
Dexterity saving throw or take the vortex's full
damage and suffer its effects. A creature takes half
the damage on a successful save and doesn't suffer
the vortex's effects.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, both the
bludgeoning damage for contacting the vortex and
for creatures restrained within increases by 1d8 for
every slot level above 7th.
