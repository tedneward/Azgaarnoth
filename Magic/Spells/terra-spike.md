Choose a creature or object that you can see which is adjacent to a surface within range, like a floor, wall or ceiling. The surface doesn't have to be made of a single contiguous materiaL but it must be mostly made of earth, sand, stone, metal crystal or another suitable earthen or stone-like materiaL and it must be at least 6 inches deep, or else the spell fails. 

You summon a solid spike out of the surface material to impale the target, which must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 3dl0 nonmagical piercing damage, or half damage on a success. If the target is flat against the surface, such as a prone target being spiked from the ground, the target is imperiled, giving it disadvantage on the saving throw and increasing the damage dealt from 3d10 to 3d12. The spike crumbles to dust after the saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 or 1d12 if the target is imperiled for each slot level above 2nd.
