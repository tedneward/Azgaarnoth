# Blade of Flickering Shadows
*4th-level necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You temporarily become a creature of shadow, flickering in and out of a demiplane on the borders of the Shadowfell, as your weapon ripples with dark magic. Until the spell ends, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and your melee weapon attacks inflict an additional 3d4 necrotic damage on a hit.

Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in a shadowy reflection of it, which lies somewhere on the planar boundary between your current location and the Shadowfell (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are in the shadowy reflection of your current plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.

While in the shadowy reflection, you can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything is lightly obscured, and you can't see anything more than 30 feet away. You are not truly in the Shadowfell, nor in your previous location during that time, but somewhere in between the planes. Whenever you are in the shadowy reflection, you can only affect, or be affected by, creatures with resistance or immunity to necrotic damage.
