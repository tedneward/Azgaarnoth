- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S

---
A ray of piercing magical force is shot from your hand. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature, object, or structure. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 force damage and 3d6 piercing damage. Objects and structures take double damage from the ray.

For every 5 points of total damage the ray deals to an unattended nonmagical object or structure, the ray produces 6 inches of length for a 1-inch diameter tunnel through the object or structure.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you increase the piercing damage by 2d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
