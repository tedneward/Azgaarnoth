# Light Lance
*3rd-level evocation* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a magnesium strip)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A scintillating line of searing light, 100 feet long and 5 feet wide, bursts forth from your hands in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail their saving throw also become sheathed in scintillating sparks until the end of their next turn, granting advantage to all attacks made against them.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radiant damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
