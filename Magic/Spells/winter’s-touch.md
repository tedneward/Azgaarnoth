You generate a continuous chill from your hands and/or feet, chosen when you cast this spell. For the duration, you gain the following benefits, depending on whether you choose to have the spell affect your hands, feet, or both (you can also choose just a single hand or foot).

* Your unarmed attack deals an additional 1d4 points of cold damage on a hit.
* A creature takes 1d4 cold damage when it ends its turn while being grappled by you.
* You can freeze the liquid in a container that you are in contact with, up to no more than a 1-foot cube of liquid. You must be in contact with the container or liquid for at least 1 round.
* You can turn liquid (with possible exceptions such as lava) into ice under your bare feet, producing a surface that you can brieﬂy move on. If you do not move during your next turn after entering a space by grounded movement over a body of liquid, you will sink into the liquid.

***At Higher Levels.*** This spell’s additional damage on unarmed attacks and damage to grappled creatures each increase to 2d4 at 5th level, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 17th level.
