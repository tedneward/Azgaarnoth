#### Chains of Force
*5th-level evocation* (Cleric, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You cause translucent chains of solid magical force to appear and wrap around a Large or smaller creature you can see. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained for the duration. When the creature starts a turn, it can choose to make a Strength saving throw or Dexterity saving throw in an attempt to slip out of or loosen the chains. After making two successful saves against this spell while restrained, the spell ends. You can use an action on your turn to reinforce the chains if the creature is within 30 feet of you, applying disadvantage on the creatureâ€™s next saving throw. If the creature takes damage from an attack or area effect originating from a source other than the creature itself, the spell ends.

The chains themselves are immune to all damage and shed bright light out to 5 feet, and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can use the spell on a Huge creature.
