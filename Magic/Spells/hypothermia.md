You select a creature that you can see within range
as you evoke swirling cold mists around it; the
creature must make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, it takes 2d10 cold damage and
suffers one level of exhaustion. On a successful save,
the creature takes half the cold damage, and doesn't
suffer from exhaustion.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the cold damage
increases by 1d10 for every slot level above 4th.
