#### Virtuous Strike
*Evocation cantrip* (Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee weapon attack against a
creature within range, otherwise the spell fails. On a
hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects,
and divine light invested in your weapon fills you
with resolve. If the target forces you to make a saving throw before the start of your next turn, the
target takes an additional 1d6 psychic damage, you
gain a bonus on the saving throw equal to the
psychic damage inflicted, and the spell ends.
The spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an
extra 1d6 radiant damage to the target, and the
psychic damage the target takes for forcing you to
make a saving throw increases to 2d6. Both damage
rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th level and 17th level.
