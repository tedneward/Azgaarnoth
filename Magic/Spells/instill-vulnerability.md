---
You select a target within range. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is vulnerable to the energy type you select (acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder) for the duration of the spell. If the saving throw is successful, the spell ends.

If a creature is immune to the selected damage type, but fails its saving throw, it is affected, and it is no longer immune to that damage type. Instead, it has resistance to the damage type for the duration of the spell.
