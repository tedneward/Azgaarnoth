#### Dread Mercy
*2nd-level enchantment* (Bard,Paladin,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you reduce a creature within 60 feet to 0 hit points with a weapon attack
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You offer an opponent mercy in exchange for its
cooperation. Choose one creature within range that
you have just reduced to 0 hit points with a weapon
attack. You instead reduce that creature to 1 hit
point and immediately command its surrender. It
must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure,
the creature is frightened of you, but rather than
fleeing, the frightened creature stays where it is and
does not move unless you tell it to.
For the duration, the creature (that failed its save)
will not attack you, and it fearfully obeys any
instructions it can hear and understand that will
not directly harm it (for example, it will not
knowingly drink poison or walk off a cliff).
While affected, the creature will not deliberately
say anything to you that it believes to be a lie,
though it can simply remain silent if you do not ask
any direct questions.
Whenever you or one of your allies attempt to
harm the creature, or if you give it instructions that
would harm it or force it to make a saving throw
against another effect, it repeats its Wisdom saving
throw against this spell, ending the spell on a
success. You always know if a creature has
succeeded or failed on a saving throw against this
spell. When the spell's effect ends, a creature that
never succeeded on any saving throws against this
spell is unaware it was magically influenced,
believing its fear of you was merely natural.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration is
increased to 1 hour. If you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration is
increased to 8 hours.
