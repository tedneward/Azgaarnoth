A beam of pale blue light ﬂashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of frigid air that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes cold damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.

If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to burst in a freezing explosion. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.

The air spreads around corners. It extinguishes nonmagical fires that it engulfs and freezes unattended liquids. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
