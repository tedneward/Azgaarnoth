___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
From your body erupts a wave of shadowy void crackling with purple lightning, engulfing everything nearby before the void quickly fades. Each creature within 20 feet must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 necrotic damage and is necrotized until the start of your next turn. A creature takes half damage on a successful save. A creature that is killed by this spell can not be resurrected for 24 hours, and it corpse takes half as long to turn into an undead.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you increase the necrotic damage by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
