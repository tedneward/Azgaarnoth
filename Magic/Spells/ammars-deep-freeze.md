---
You freeze the liquid inside one creature that you can see within range. The target is paralyzed until the spell ends, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 7d10 + 30 cold damage, or half as much damage on a success. Water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage and are never immune to this paralysis. The target makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.

This spell has no effect on creatures that are immune to cold damage, constructs, or undead. 

A creature killed by this spell is transformed completely into ice.
