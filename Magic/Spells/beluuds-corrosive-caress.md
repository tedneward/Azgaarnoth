#### Beluud's Corrosive Caress
*1st-level conjuration* (Artificer, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You attempt to touch a creature as you conjure magical acid into the palm of your hand. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 5d4 acid damage, and nonmagical armor worn by the target is partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative -2 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.

Armor that is affected or destroyed by this spell can be fully restored with the [mending](mending.md) spell or through the use of appropriate tools.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.
