---
You share in the pain of your enemy, risking your
own sanity, but gaining insights into how to defeat
it. For the duration, whenever a creature within 30
feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction
to take psychic damage equal to half the amount of
damage taken by that creature. This damage cannot
be reduced or redirected in any way. Whenever you
do so, all attacks against that creature are made at
advantage until the end of your next turn.
