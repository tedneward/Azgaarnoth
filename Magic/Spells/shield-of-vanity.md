With a barked word you call attention to and magically glaze the front of a shield (which must be used as materials for the spell) to a polished enchanted reflection. For the duration of the speli your shield gives off bright light for 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet, and grants you an extra + 1 bonus to AC.

In addition, while the spell is active, each enemy within 10 feet of you that can see you must make a Charisma saving throw when it starts its tum. On a failed saving throw, that creature cannot move further away from you, make an attack that does not target you, or cast a spell that targets other creatures but does not target you, lasting until the start of its next turn.

Creatures that cannot be charmed that are blinded that have less than 6 Intelligence, or that have no reflection are immune to the effects of this spell.

If you stop holding the shield the spell ends immediately. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the saving throw effect, the bright light, and the dim light increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st, and the bonus to AC  increases by 1 for every three slot levels above 1st.
