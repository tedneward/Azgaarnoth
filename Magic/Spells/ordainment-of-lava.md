Your body transforms entirely into magical lava for the duration, granting you the following benefits: 

* You are immune to fire damage and you have resistance to all damage except cold damage. 
* You ignore the effects of disease, exhaustion, and poisons. Any poisons or diseases already in your system are suspended, not neutralized 
* When a creature ends its turn while grappling you or being grappled by you, it takes 8d8 fire damage. 
* You can use an action to try to grapple a creature with a free hand made of magic lava. Make a melee spell attack against one creature. On a hit, the target takes 8d8 fire damage and it is grappled by you and restrained while it is grappled The grapple's escape DC is equal to your spell save DC. 
* When another spell you cast deals fire damage, it ignores resistance to fire damage, and it deals extra fire damage equal to 10 + twice the spell's level. A spell can't deal this extra damage to any creature more than once per turn.
