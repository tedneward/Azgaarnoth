You chant a maddening incantation that sears your
enemy's thoughts, blinding it to a looming threat.
Choose a target within range to make a Wisdom
saving throw. On a failed save, choose a second
creature within range, which becomes invisible to
the target for the duration. At the end of each of the
target's turns before the spell ends, the target must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 5d12
psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell
ends.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 6th.
