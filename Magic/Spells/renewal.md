*Transmutation cantrip* (Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Druid)

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M ( clean water and dressing)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You gently apply vital magic to one creature that you touch, causing its body to accelerate its natural healing. The target can expend hit dice and regains hit points as if it had done so during a short rest. The minimum number of hit points the target regains from each hit die expended this way equals your Spellcasting modifier.

The maximum number of hit dice a creature can expend through this spell before it finishes a long rest is equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), no matter how many times the spell is cast or who casts it.

At 5th levei the limit on hit dice expended per long rest is increased by one hit dice. At 11th level it is increased by one more hit dice, and at 17th level it is again increased by one.
