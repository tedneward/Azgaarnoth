You cause all light in a 60-foot-radius centered on a point you can see to be drawn and condensed into a tiny orb of light at the center, leaving most of the affected area in non-magical darkness. The exterior of the affected area appears to be a pitch-black sphere of darkness. The orb itself leaks bright light in a 10-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Only creatures inside the affected area can see the orb at the center. The light leaked by the orb is not considered magical light.
