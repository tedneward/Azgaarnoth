# Simbul's Spell Sequencer
*7th-level enchantment* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, M (pieces of amber worth a total of 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: 1 year

You use several pieces of ancient amber to create a matrix that contains spells you cast, frozen in time until you need them. Once the matrix is created, for the next minute, you can choose a command word and then cast up to three spells into the matrix. All three spells must be of 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level and must have a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action. After the end of that minute, when the command word is spoken for the first time, the first spell you cast into the matrix takes effect, and you gain two legendary actions, which can only be used at the end of a creature’s turn (including your current turn). When you use the first of these two legendary actions, the second spell cast into the matrix immediately takes effect, and when you use the second legendary action, the last spell in the matrix immediately takes effect, and the spell ends. Otherwise, the spell ends at the end of your next turn.

Whenever a spell is unleashed from the matrix, you immediately make all decisions for that spell (targets, area, etc.) that you would normally make as the caster.

You can never have more than one *Simbul’s spell sequencer* active at a time.

When you create the sequencer, you reduce your maximum Hit Dice by a number equal to the total combined levels of the spell slots used to cast the spells you place in it. Your maximum number of Hit Dice does not return to normal until the spell ends. Also, you cannot regain any spell slots used to cast spells into the matrix until the Simbul’s spell sequencer spell ends. If the duration expires and you did not speak the command word, or if you choose to dismiss the spell as bonus action during your turn, the spell ends. When the spell ends, any unused spells in the sequencer are lost.
