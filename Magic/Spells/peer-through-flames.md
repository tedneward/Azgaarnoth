You gain the ability to pass your senses into distant flames, allowing you to spy or communicate.Upon casting this spell, you become aware of the location of every nonmagical flame within 100 miles.

As an action, you can pass your consciousness into any one of those flames. When you do so, you can see and hear as though you were in the selected flame's location, but you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. You can continue to observe through the flame until the spell ends, until you switch to a different flame as an action, or until you resume your normal senses as an action.

While you are observing through a flame, you can choose to speak through it as well. Doing so causes the flame to take on the rough shape of your face, and maintains this visage until you are no longer present in that flame.
