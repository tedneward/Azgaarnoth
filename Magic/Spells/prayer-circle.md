#### Prayer Circle
*5th-level evocation* *(ritual)* (Cleric, Paladin)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of casterâ€™s blood and chalk)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
As part of casting this spell, you draw a 10-foot radius circle of sacred symbols and glyphs on a solid surface. You complete the spell with a drop of your own blood, activating the magical circuit of the circle with the divine energy coursing through you. If you or a friendly creature casts a spell that causes a creature to regain hit points while on the circle, the dice rolled for the hit points are maximized. If you add holy water as a spell component (consumed in the casting), every creature entering or on the circle gains the benefit of the protection from good and evil spell until they exit it.
