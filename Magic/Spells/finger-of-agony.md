*4th-level necromancy* (Pale Master,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gaff hook)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You reach out with a magically empowered metal hook, which magically extends and twists to tear your victim's organs apart inside its body. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 magical slashing damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. The agony is unbearable, and a target that fails its Constitution save is also poisoned until the end of its next turn.

Whether or not the target fails its saving throw, on each of your turns for the duration, you can use a bonus action to try to slash the same target again. Each time you use your bonus action to do this, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 magical slashing damage on a failed save or half as much on a success, but suffering no other effects. The spell ends early if the target succeeds on three saving throws against this spell.
