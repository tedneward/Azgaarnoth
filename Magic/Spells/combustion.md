You become a locus for the primal force of combustion itself. Until the spell ends, the following effects occur within 90 feet of you and are not blocked by total cover: 

* Objects in the area have vulnerability to fire damage. 
* Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried are automatically on fire. 
* Fire in the area cannot be doused, extinguished, or smothered and doesn't require air. 
* Each creature that enters the area or starts its turn in it is lit [ablaze](../Conditions/Ablaze.md). 
* Metal objects in the area are heated. A creature in physical contact with a heated object takes 2d8 fire damage at the end of each of your turns, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks while holding or wearing a heated object unless it is immune to fire damage. 
* When another effect in the area rolls a 1 or a 2 on a damage die for fire damage, the die is rerolled and must use the new rolL even if the new roll is a 1 or 2. 

When you cast the spelL you can choose any number of creatures and objects to be completely unaffected by the spell.
