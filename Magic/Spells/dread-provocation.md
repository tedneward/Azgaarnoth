#### Dread Provocation
*1st-level enchantment* (Paladin,Warlock)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
After a feint and an attack against your foe, you
appear defenseless, but otherworldly power
disguises your cunning readiness to capitalize on
their next move. As part of the action used to cast
this spell, you must make a melee attack with a
weapon against one creature within the spell's
range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target
suffers the attack's normal effects and takes an
additional 1d10 psychic damage, and until the start
of your next turn, you and the target have
advantage on attack rolls against each other, but
disadvantage on attack rolls against all other
creatures.
In addition, the next time the target attacks you
before the start of your next turn, it provokes
opportunity attacks from you and any other allies of
yours within 5 feet of it.
