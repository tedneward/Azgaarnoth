___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the
spell fails. On a hit, you channel the battlefield
discipline of past heroes to choose one of the
following benefits:

* The next time you make an attack roll before the end of your next turn, you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to your attack roll.

* The next time an ally of your choice within 5 feet of you is attacked before the end of your next turn, it can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to its Armor Class against that attack.

* As part of the action used to cast this spell, you can move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals
extra force damage to the target equal to your
spellcasting ability modifier. This extra force
damage increases to 1d10 + your spellcasting ability
modifier at 11th level, and 2d10 + your spellcasting
ability modifier at 17th level.
