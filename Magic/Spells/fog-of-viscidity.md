*2nd-level conjuration* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You conjure dense, white fog that fills a 30-foot
sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The fog is thick and clings to anyone in its
area of effect, causing the speed of any creature that
is within the fog's area, enters it, or starts its turn
there, to be reduced by half until the start of its next
turn.

The fog obscures all vision, even darkvision. Any
creature within the fog is heavily obscured to
creatures more than 5 feet away, and lightly
obscured to creatures within 5 feet.
