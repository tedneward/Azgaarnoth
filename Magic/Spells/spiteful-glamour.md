For a moment, you cause the mere sight of you to
be painful to an enemy. Choose one creature you
can see within range that can also see you. The
target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or
take 1d8 psychic damage. If the target is not missing
any of its hit points, it instead takes 1d12 psychic
damage.
The spell's damage increases by one die when you
reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d12), 11th level (3d8 or 3d12),
and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).
