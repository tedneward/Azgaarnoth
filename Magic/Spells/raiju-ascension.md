___

- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 4 hours
---
You transform yourself in a being of pure lightning
with terrible power. You retain your size category 
and general shape, as well as your existing features 
and abilities, and for the duration you gain the 
following benefits.

You glow with a yellow or blue light (your choice),
shedding bright light out to a 30-foot radius and dim
light for an additional 30 feet. You gain a flying 
speed of 60 feet, and can choose to pass through 
solid objects, although you take 2d10 force damage if
you end your turn inside a solid object.

You have immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and 
slashing damage. You are also immune to lightning 
damage, and any effect that would deal lightning 
damage to you instead grants you that many 
temporary hit points. Any creature that hits you 
with a melee attack takes 4d12 lightning damage.
You can cast lightning bolt as a 3rd-level spell 
without expending a spell slot. All your spells and 
abilities ignore other creatures' resistance to 
lightning damage.
