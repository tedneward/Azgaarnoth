You wrap your weapon with ghostly, translucent white ﬂames as you strike with it. As part of the action used to cast this spell, you make a melee weapon attack against a creature. If the target is on the Border Ethereal or incorporeal, you attack it normally and ignore damage resistance or immunity for your weapon damage. If the target is not native to the plane that you’re on, you deal an additional 1d6 radiant damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** The spell’s additional damage increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.
