# Duplicate Soul Object
*Conjuration cantrip* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour

If you are a [Soulbinder](/Classes/Wizard/Soulbinding.md), you create a translucent copy of your [soul object](/Classes/Wizard/Soulbinding.md#soulbond), constructed from force. The duplicate has an AC of 10 and 1 hit point. The duplicate serves as a material component for several spells (see below), and you are aware of its approximate direction and distance from you as long as it remains on the same plane. You may only have one duplicate at a time. If you cast this cantrip again before the first expires, the older duplicate is replaced by the newer one.

If you are not a [Soulbinder](/Classes/Wizard/Soulbinding.md), this cantrip has no effect and serves no purpose.
