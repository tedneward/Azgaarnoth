# Animate Cranium
*1st-level necromancy* (ritual) (PaleMaster)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a humanoid skull)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You infuse a skull with dark energy, granting it the foul mimicry of life. The skull is an object that has AC 5 and 1 Hit Point. When you cast this spell, you can speak a phrase of up to 10 words, which are memorized by the skull. Whenever a creature other than yourself or of your choosing enters an area within 15 feet of skull for the first time, the skull speaks the phrase exactly as it was taught.

For the duration, if the skull is destroyed while the spell is active, the dark energies seep out the remains. Every creature within a 15-foot radius circle around the skull must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 necrotic damage. You can only animate one cranium with this spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the other animated cranium is destroyed, dealing the necrotic damage.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the Duration is 24 hours. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the Duration is 10 days. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the Duration is 30 days. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.
