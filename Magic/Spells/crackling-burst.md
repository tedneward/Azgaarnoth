#### Crackling Burst
*4th-level evocation* (Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You blast a creature or object with lightning, 
which then arcs to a number of other targets up to 
your spellcasting ability modifier within 30 feet of 
the primary target.

Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 5d10 lightning damage on a failed save or half
as much damage on a successful save. If the primary 
target is wearing heavy armor made primarily of 
metal or is a creature made primarily of metal (such 
as an iron golem) then the secondary targets have 
disadvantage on their saving throws.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
