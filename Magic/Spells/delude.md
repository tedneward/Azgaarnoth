---
You attempt to enchant the senses of one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target's senses are magically altered until the spell ends. One creature or object of your choice that the target can see when the spell is cast appears to be different to all its senses, and the target does not notice the transformation, only that things have changed.

If you choose a creature, then that creature - including its clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on its person - can be made to appear different to the target's senses. You can have it seem 1 foot shorter or taller and have it appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change its body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. This does not alter what the chosen creature appears to do or say, but does change how it looks and sounds.

If you choose an object, you may have it appear as any creature or object of the same size category, but it will not appear to move or act as a living creature unless the object itself already does so.

The target makes an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful saving throw, it realizes that its senses have been deceived, and the effect ends for it.

***At Higher Levels.***When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them, and they all perceive the same alterations to the same subject.
