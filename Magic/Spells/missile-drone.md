You create a glowing, ï¬‚oating, intangible sphere of magical force in an unoccupied space of your choice you can see. The sphere moves with you, and you can use a bonus action on your turn to mentally command the sphere to fire a missile of magical force at a creature of your choice you can see within 120 feet. The missile hits the creature automatically, dealing 1d4 +1 force damage; the missile is treated as if created by the spell [magic missile](../magic-missile.md), for the purpose of effect interactions. The sphere sheds bright light in a radius of 20 feet, and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you create an additional sphere for every two slot levels above 3rd. Up to all of the spheres can be simultaneously commanded to shoot missiles, but they can only shoot at the same creature.
