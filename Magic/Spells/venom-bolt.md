A beam forming a 5-foot wide by 100-foot line of
caustic green energy blasts from your eye, mouth,
fingertip, or tail tip in a direction you choose. Every
creature in the affected area must roll a Dexterity
saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage on a failure
or half as much on a success.
In addition, the blast poisons the area it struck
with toxic energy and nauseating fumes for the
duration. When a creature enters the affected area
for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it
must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8
poison damage and become poisoned for the
duration. If it succeeds, it takes half the damage.
A creature that is poisoned by this spell but is no
longer within the affected area can make a
Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its
turns. On a success, it is no longer poisoned.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the acid damage
increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
