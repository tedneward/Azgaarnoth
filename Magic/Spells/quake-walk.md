- **Range:** Self (15 feet) 
- **Components:** V, S

---
You begin stomping and grinding your feet, causing the ground around you to temporarily deform like rubber under your earthen magic. Each other creature within 15 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature is knocked prone. 

Until the spell ends, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for other creatures. In addition, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns after the first to stomp the ground, forcing all other creatures within the area to repeat the saving throw, falling prone on a failed save.

This spell can't affect creatures that aren't on the ground, and only functions while you are on the ground or in the ground and you aren't incapacitated.
