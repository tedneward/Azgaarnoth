You evoke a fiery torrent to erupt from a solid surface you can see. This wave of ﬂames is created in a 20-foot wide, 20-foot high, 40-foot long line. If a creature is in the affected area when the spell is cast, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 9d8 fire damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage.The fire spreads around corners. The spell damages objects in the area and ignites ﬂammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
