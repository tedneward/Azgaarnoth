With a subtle gesture, you carve a slice of shadow from the air around you and cast it toward your foe. It wraps around the creatureâ€™s neck and squeezes the life from it.

Make a ranged spell attack on a creature within range. On a hit the target take 1d6 Necrotic Damage and it can't speak until the start of your next turn. If the target is in dim light or darkness you may apply sneak attack damage dice to this spell's damage roll. All of this damage is Necrotic.

The spells damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and at 17th level (4d6)
