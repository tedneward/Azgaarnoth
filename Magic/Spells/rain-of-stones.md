You create ten small stones, no larger than your fist, in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spellâ€™s duration. When you cast the spell, and as a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns, you can send from 1 to 4 of the stones streaking towards a target or targets of your choice, within 120 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack against each target for each stone you send forth. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 bludgeoning damage for each stone that hits it. When the spell ends, any remaining stones disappear. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can create two additional stones for each slot level above 3rd.
