*Conjuration cantrip (Sorcerer)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a creature within 5 feet of you uses the Disengage action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round

As part of the reaction used to cast this spell, you
must a melee attack with a weapon against the
triggering creature, otherwise the spell fails. On a
hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects,
and if the target is more than 5 feet away from you
at the start of your next turn, you can immediately
use a bonus action to teleport up to 30 feet to an
unoccupied space adjacent to that creature. After
you make the choice of whether or not to use your
bonus action to teleport, the spell ends. After this
spell ends, until the end of your next turn, your
speed is halved and you cannot benefit from any
bonus to your speed.
