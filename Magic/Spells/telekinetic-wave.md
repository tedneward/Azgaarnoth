- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Invisible, repulsive force erupts with a dull rumbling sound from your body, pushing creatures and unattended, unsecured objects away from you. Every creature within a 5 foot radius of you must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 20 feet from you. On a successful save, the creature is pushed 10 feet. If the creature’s or object’s forced movement is interrupted by impact with an obstruction such as a wall, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it still had yet to be pushed.The amount of forced movement is halved for Huge creatures, and Gargantuan creatures are immune to this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you increase the radius by 5 feet for each slot level higher than 2nd.
