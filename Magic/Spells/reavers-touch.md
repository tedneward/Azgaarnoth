# Reaver's Touch
*Necromancy cantrip* (Cleric, Druid, Pale Master, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

The touch of your hand drains a target’s life energy, allowing you to sacrifice animals, or sometimes other creatures, to make their vitality your own. Make a melee spell attack against a conscious living creature within range. You have advantage if the target is a beast. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt (rounded up).

The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
