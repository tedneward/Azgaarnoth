As part of the action of casting this spell you must stab an unconscious celestial with the dagger. The celestial must be one you have hunted and defeated through combat, and it must have been reduced to 10 hit points or fewer. It cannot be one you have summoned through magic. The celestial must have a CR equal to half your level or greater. 

The celestial is immediately slain and you gain +4, to a maximum of 22, to one ability score for the duration. The evil of this spell sticks to you like a miasma, residents of the Upper Planes and their servants will find you uncomfortable at best and react violently at worst.

***At Higher Levels.***  You can cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher. The duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 5th.
