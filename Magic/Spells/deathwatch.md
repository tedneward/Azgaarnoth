#### Deathwatch
*1st-level necromancy* (Artificer,Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You grant yourself a heightened sense for the
energies of life and death. For the duration, you
always know whether each creature within range
that is not behind total cover is near death (at 0 hit
points) or fragile (less than 25% of their hit point
maximum). You also know if a creature is undead,
alive, or neither (an unliving construct, for
example).
If something appears to be a creature, but is not,
or if it is something that has never been alive (such
as a statue), you sense that as well.
This spell does not penetrate illusions (causing
illusory creatures to appear alive), and if a creature
is under the effects of a feign death spell or a similar
effect, you detect it as being dead. If a creature is a
construct but also alive (such as a warforged), you
detect it as being alive.
