# Veiled Blade
*3rd-level illusion* (Bard, Ranger; Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Make a ranged spell attack against one target you can see within range as you hurl an invisible and nearly silent projectile of sharpened magical force at it. You have advantage on the attack roll if the creature does not have blindsight or truesight and cannot see invisible objects. On a hit, the target takes 10d4 force damage, or half as much damage on a miss. If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, they do not make a sound as they fall.

Also, if you have the sneak attack class feature and you hit with this spell attack, you can trigger your sneak attack off of the attack as if it were a ranged weapon attack that dealt piercing damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 3rd.
