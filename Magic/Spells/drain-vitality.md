A grey, skull-shaped cloud rises over your foe to sap
its heath. The target must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or gaining 1 level of exhaustion.
Until the spell ends, once during each of your
turns you can use your action to force the target to
make another Wisdom save. On a failure, it gains
another level of exhaustion. When the target makes three successful Wisdom saves, or when it has four
levels of exhaustion, the spell ends.
