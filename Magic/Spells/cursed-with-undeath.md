# Cursed with Undeath
*1st-level necromancy* (Pale Master, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a humanoid creature that has at least 1 hit point, placing a curse upon it for 1 minute. If the creature dies while the curse is active, it is raised as a zombie under your control (the DM has the creature's game statistics). A [remove curse](/Magic/Spells/remove-curse.md) spell ends this effect when cast upon a living creature. 

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (issuing the same command to each one if you control multiple creatures).

The creature is under your control for 1 minute, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it.
