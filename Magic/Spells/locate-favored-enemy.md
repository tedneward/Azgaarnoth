# Locate Favored Enemy
*5th-level divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour

You become aware of the presence, number, general direction, and distance of favored enemies within 1 mile of you. You can tell how many of your favored enemies are present at each location, their distance from your present location, and the direction and speed of their current movement. This spell does not allow you to discern whether a specific creature is present within range, but only if favored enemies in general are present.
