You create a bolt of energy made of moonlight that
streaks from your hand unerringly towards one
target within range.
A living creature struck by a moon bolt takes
radiant damage equal to 4d4 + your spellcasting
ability modifier. In addition, the target must make a
Constitution saving throw, or it has disadvantage on
Strength ability checks and saving throws for 1
minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the Strength
sapping effect on a success.
An undead creature struck by the moon bolt
takes radiant damage equal to 8d4 + your
spellcasting ability modifier. In addition, the
creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, or it is
knocked prone and incapacitated for 1 minute. The
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the incapacitated condition
on a success. Afterwards, it can stand but has
disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom saving
throws for the spell's duration.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the amount of
radiant damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level
above 4th.
