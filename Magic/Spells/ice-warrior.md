- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You conjure a medium creature made of magical ice in the shape of a humanoid warrior. The ice warrior appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. It is considered an elemental.

The summoned warrior is friendly to you and your companions. The warrior acts immediately after you in the initiative order. It obeys any verbal commands you issue to it (no action required by you), but its abilities are limited (see below). If you don't issue any commands to the warrior, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

The ice warrior cannot take any actions except the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. It has the statistics of a [veteran](../../Creatures/Humans.md#human-veteran) except that it cannot speak, its longsword attack is always one-handed, it deals an extra 1d4 cold damage on a hit, and it lacks the shortsword and crossbow attack options. Additionally, it has vulnerability to fire damage and immunity to cold, necrotic, and poison damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you can summon more warriors: two warriors with a 5th-level slot, three warriors with a 7th-level slot, and four warriors with a 9th-level slot.
