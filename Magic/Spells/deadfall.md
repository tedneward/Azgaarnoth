#### Deadfall
*8th-level conjuration* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You summon a 20-foot radius by 40-foot high
towering pile of wood and branches that collapses
to the ground at a point you choose within range. A
creature caught in the area when the pile collapses
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature takes 12d10 bludgeoning damage,
is knocked prone, and is restrained under the pile.
On a successful save, the creature takes half the
bludgeoning damage, isn't knocked prone, and isn't
restrained.
A restrained creature can attempt to free itself by
using an action on its turn to make a Strength check
against a DC of 20. Another creature can spend its
actions every round for 1 minute to clear the rubble
around the trapped creature. The area affected by
this spell is considered difficult terrain until it is
cleared.
