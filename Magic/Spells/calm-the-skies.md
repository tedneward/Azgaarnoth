Waves of calming energy erupt from your location, dispersing the weather in the local region, if only for a brief while. When you cast this spell, the clouds in the sky above the land around you out to 5 miles in every direction dissipate (producing a clear sky), all wind within 5 miles becomes a gentle breeze, and all temperatures within 5 miles become mildly cool or mildly warm (at the caster’s choice). The conditions applied by the spell last for at least 1 hour, but may naturally last longer depending on the natural weather conditions around and within the affected area (for example, it might take some time for clouds to reappear over the affected area).

If this spell’s area overlaps with the affected area of an 8th level or lower spell that affects weather, the other spell is suppressed for 1 hour (though the duration continues to run out as normal).
