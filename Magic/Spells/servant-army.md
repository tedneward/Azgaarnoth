---
You create a number of invisible, mindless, shapeless forces that perform simple tasks at your
command. Roll 3d4 to determine how many
servants you create. Each servant obeys any verbal
commands that you issue (no action required by
you). However, if you don't issue any commands, a
servant does nothing as it awaits your next
command.
Once you give a command, each servant performs
its task to the best of its ability until its task is
completed. It then waits for your next command.
Your servants can run and fetch things, open
unstuck doors, and hold chairs as well as clean and
mend. A servant can also be used for common
laborious tasks, if you carefully direct it. The
servants are no better or faster at tasks than a basic
or unskilled commoner would be.
The servants can serve food or wine at a banquet,
help dig earthworks, row a ship, act as porters, fold
clothes, or assist in a farmer's fields. Each servant
can perform only one activity at a time, but it
repeats the same activity continuously if told to do
so. This allows you to command one servant to
perform a repetitive task and then turn your
attention elsewhere if you remain within range.
Servants can open only normal doors, drawers, lids,
and so forth. They have an effective Strength score
of 2 (so they can carry 30 pounds, and push, drag, or
lift 60 pounds). They can trigger traps and such, but
they can exert only 60 pounds of force, and that is
not enough to activate certain pressure plates and
other devices. A servant's speed is 15 feet.
The servants cannot attack in any way, and are
never allowed to make an attack roll. The servants
have an Armor Class of 10 and 6 hit points. The
servants cannot be killed, but they dissipate after
taking 6 points of damage. (They do not make
saving throws). If you attempt to send a servant
beyond the spell's range (measured from your
current position), that servant ceases to exist.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you create 1d4
additional servants for every slot level above 5th.
When you cast it using a spell slot of 7th level or
higher, the spell's duration increases to 8 hours.
