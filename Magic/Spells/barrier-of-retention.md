You create a hemisphere 10 feet in diameter anywhere within range. Creatures moving into the warded area are unhindered., but creatures trying to leave the warded area are stopped by an invisible barrier. Treat creatures trying to leave the area as it was surrounded by a wall of force. Once a creature is trapped in the warded area, no physical or spell attack can pass through the wall. A disintegrate spell will destroy the barrier. The barrier will not stop someone from teleporting, or a similar effect, out of the area.
