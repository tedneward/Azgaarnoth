#### Knocking Pulse
*1st-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You send a ï¬‚ow of kinetic energy into the ground, which curves upwards toward a Medium or smaller creature of your choice you can see; the target must be on a surface connected to or in contact with the ground that you are currently on. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 30 feet upwards and must make a DC 15 Dexterity check to avoid falling prone on the landing.

If the creature impacts with a surface on the way up before it completes the entire 30 feet, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the impact for every 10 feet that was subtracted from the rising movement, and half damage on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can add one more target for each slot level higher than 1st.
