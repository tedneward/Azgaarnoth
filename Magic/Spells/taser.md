You send a pulse of electricity through a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 lightning damage and is incapacitated until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not incapacitated.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
