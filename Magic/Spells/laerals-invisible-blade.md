#### Laeral's Invisible Blade
*8th-level evocation* (Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a metal-bladed weapon that is consumed by the spell)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create an invisible sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. Because the sword is invisible, you have advantage on all attack rolls with the sword against creatures that can't see invisible objects. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.
