# Beckon Closer
*6th-level conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You beckon a creature that you can see within range.

The target creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be teleported to another point of your choosing within range, that is closer to you. The act of teleporting the creature in this way causes both you and the target to become disoriented and drop your guard, immediately provoking opportunity attacks by hostile creatures against you, as well as against the target creature at its new location.
