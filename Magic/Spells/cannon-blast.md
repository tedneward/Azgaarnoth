___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** Self (60 feet) 
- **Components:** V 
- **Duration:** 1 turn 
---
You release a blast of flame behind you that rockets you into the air. You fly up to 60 feet in a straight line and stop at the first creature you contact. You can choose to make a melee spell attack against the creature, hitting it with a magic barrier. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage and 2d6 force damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. On a miss, the target takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. 

For this turn, your barrier grants you resistance to damage from falls, and falls do not knock you prone upon landing. Upon finishing the movement and attack caused by this spelL you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the force damage dealt increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
