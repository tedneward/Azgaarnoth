___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A sun-like 10-foot diameter sphere of light
appears, centered on a point you can see
within range that is at least 20 feet above
you. The spell fails if you can't see a point
in the air where the sun could appear
(for example, if you are in a room that
can't accommodate the required
height).
When you cast the spell, choose a
point you can see within range, which is
stuck by a blinding ray of light from the
false sun. Make a ranged spell attack,
ignoring cover. On a hit, the target takes
2d6 radiant damage. If the target is undead,
roll d8s for this damage instead of d6s. A
target that takes this damage must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is blinded
until the end of your next turn.
The false sun vanishes at the end of the turn, but
until then it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius
and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
At Higher Levels.  You can cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, increasing the
damage by 1d6 (1d8 against undead) for each spell
level above 1st.
