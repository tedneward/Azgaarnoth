#### Static Shock
*Abjuration cantrip* (Artificer,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 15 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within
range. If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d4
lightning damage and it is charged with crackling
arcane energy until the spell ends. If the target
makes an attack roll before the end of its next turn,
it takes force damage equal to your spellcasting
ability modifier. If the attack hits, the damage the
attack inflicts is reduced by an amount equal to the
force damage dealt by this spell. Either way, the
spell ends after the attack is resolved.
At 5th level, the lightning damage from the
ranged spell attack increases by 1d4, and the force
damage dealt to a target who attacks equals 1d4 +
your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damages
increase by 1d4 at 11th and 17th level.
