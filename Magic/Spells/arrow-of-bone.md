#### Arrow of Bone
*7th-level necromancy* (Cleric,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny sliver of bone and a drop of magic oil)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You touch one nonmagical thrown weapon and
transform it into an identical item made of bone.
The affected weapon is considered magical.
A creature struck by the weapon takes the
weapon's normal damage and must also make a
Constitution saving throw. The target takes 10d10
necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. Once the weapon is
thrown, its magic fades, whether the attack hits or
misses.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the necrotic
damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above
7th.
