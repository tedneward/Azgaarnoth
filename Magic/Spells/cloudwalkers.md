When you cast this spell, you select up to six
creatures within 5 feet of you. Small puffs of cloud attach themselves to the feet of each one, and the
creature gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the

A creature can end the effect by shaking the
cloud puffs off its feet. The spellcaster can dismiss

once.
