You cause small, indestructible spikes of solid, translucent force (of varying lengths from 6 to 12 inches) to emerge from a relatively vertical surface, in an area up to as large as a 30-foot square, originating from a point of your choice you can see. For the duration, the space within 5 feet over the surface is difficult terrain, and any creature that falls against it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, and half damage on a success. The spikes vanish when the spell ends. If a creature is in contact with the surface when you cast this spell, it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 piercing damage on a failed save, and half damage on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can use an action to make the spikes shoot outwards, ending the spell. Every creature within 30 feet on a direct line perpendicular to the affected surface must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 piercing damage on a failed save, and half damage on a success. This damage increases by 1d6 for every slot level above 5th.
