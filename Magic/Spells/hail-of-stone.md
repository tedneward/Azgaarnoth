When you cast this spell, choose a spot within
range. A 10-foot radius by 40-foot high cylinder
centered on that spot is pummelled by falling rocks.
Each creature caught within the cylinder must
make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 5d4 bludgeoning damage, or half as
much on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the bludgeoning
damage increases by 1d4 per slot level above 2nd.
