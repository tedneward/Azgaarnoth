You point at a creature you can see within range, and a powerful gust of wind blows in and carries it away. You push the creature up to 60 feet in any direction, includÂ­ing off the ground and into the air. Until the spell ends, the creature is restrained by the swirling wind. While restrained in this way, the target does not fall; instead it takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage at the end of each of its turns, and you can use a bonus action on each of your turns after the first to push the target up to 60 feet in any direction, including through the air. 

The target can use its action to attempt to escape. It makes a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC, with advantage if it has a flying speed. On a success, it frees itself. Once a creature is no longer restrained by the spelL it falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.
