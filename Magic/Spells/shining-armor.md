You wreathe yourself in weightless magical armoring crafted from plates of pure light. Until the spell ends, you shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an extra 20 feet. You also gain the following benefits for the duration: 

* When a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the plates burst with beams of light. The attacker takes 3d6 radiant damage, and other creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you take half that damage. 
* Attacks made against you have disadvantage. 
* You have resistance to radiant damage. 

In addition, if you are critically hit before the spell ends, you can use your reaction to end the spell causing the plates to explode in a protective blast of light. The attack misses, and the attacker as well as each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of your next turn. 

When the spell ends, the magical plates vanish.
