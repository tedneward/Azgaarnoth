A hovering 40-foot radius circle of glowing glyphs appears up to 60 feet from a point you can see on a solid surface, and lightning bolts rain down from it towards the surface. If a creature enters or starts its turn in a 40-foot radius, 60-foot long cylinder between the circle and the surface, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 lightning damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage.

The circle of glyphs produces bright light out to 30 feet, and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
