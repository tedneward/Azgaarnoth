You fling a needle of stinging poison at one creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage and 1d4 poison damage. If the target isn't missing any hit points or it is poisoned, you roll the poison damage twice and use the higher result. 

If the target is not immune to the poisoned condition, it also has disadvantage on any saving throws made to maintain concentration caused by the spell's damage. 

The piercing damage and the poison damage each increase by ld4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
