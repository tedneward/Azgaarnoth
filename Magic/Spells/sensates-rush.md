You channel your hunger for new experiences into a
special state of mental focus. For the duration,
whenever you attack with a weapon you have not
attacked with since the last time you rolled
initiative, you roll 1d6 and add the result to the
attack roll. You gain the same bonus when you cast
a spell requiring an attack roll that you have not
cast since the last time you rolled initiative.
