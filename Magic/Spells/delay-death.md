---
You choose one creature you can see within range
to benefit from this spell. If the affected creature's
hit points are reduced to 0, it remains conscious
and can act normally until the start of your next
turn. However, if the recipient
takes damage from a single
blow or source equal to its
Constitution score while it
has 0 hit points, then it
immediately falls
unconscious and misses it
first death saving throw.
Likewise, if the spell ends
while the recipient's
current hit points are 0,
then it falls unconscious
and misses its first death
saving throw.
If the creature dies
while under the effects of
this spell, it can be raised
from the dead by normal
means.
