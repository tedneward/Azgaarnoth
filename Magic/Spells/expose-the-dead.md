As you cast his spell any undead within range must
make a Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail are
surrounded by ghostly white flames for the
duration. These flames do not deal damage, but
they are impossible to miss. Even undead that are
shrouded by illusion, invisible, or obscured within
range are easily visible. An undead may repeat the
Wisdom saving throw at the end of their turn to
escape the flames.
