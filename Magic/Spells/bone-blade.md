#### Bone Blade
*8th-level transmutation* (Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bladed weapon and a bone from any creature)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You touch a bladed weapon and transform it into an
identical weapon made of white ivory. After the
transformation, the weapon has the exact damage,
size, and weight of the original, but has the
following special properties:
* It is unbreakable, though it crumbles to dust
when the spell ends.
* It is considered magical.
* The blade inflicts an extra weapon die of
damage against undead.
* An undead creature struck with the weapon
takes an additional 1d4 necrotic damage each
round for the duration.
* Once per turn, you can force an undead
creature you hit with the bone blade to make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature is disintegrated. If an undead creature
disintegrated by this weapon has a CR of 4 or
more, the blade also crumbles to dust.
