#### Earthen Pillar
*1st-level transmutation* (Druid,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You call forth a column of dirt to rise out of the ground in a space you can see within range. The pillar has a diameter of 5 feet, a height of 20 feet, an AC of 10 and 15 hit points.

If the pillar is created under a Medium or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity save or be lifted by the pillar. Large creatures make the save with advantage. Huge or bigger creatures are unaffected as the earthen pillar is unable to be created under the creature's weight. A Large or smaller creature can choose to fail the save.

If the pillar is prevented from reaching its full height due to contact with another solid surface, a creature on the pillar takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained. The restrained creature can use an action to make a strength or dexterity check (creature's choice) against the spell's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move or fall off the pillar.

***At Higher Levels.***When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can increase the height of the pillar by 5 feet and the potential damage it deals by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
