___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S, M (a ranged weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You infuse a rune-inscribed projectile with magic,
making it deliver an impact that belies its size. As
part of the action of casting this spell, you must
make a ranged weapon attack, otherwise the spell
ends. If that attack hits, the target takes an
additional 4d12 force damage, and it is pushed 15
feet away from you and knocked prone.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the force damage
increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 4th.
