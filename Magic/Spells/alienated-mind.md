---
You garble your own thought processes into maddening chaos, then force those thoughts onto everyone around you. Each living creature (not a construct or undead) within a 15-foot sphere originating from you must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 psychic damage, and until the end of your next turn it forgets any languages that it knows and is incapable of meaningful communication. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage but suffers no other effects.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
