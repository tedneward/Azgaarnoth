---
You transform yourself into a being of pure flame. 
You retain your size category and general shape, as 
well as your existing features and abilities, and for 
the duration you gain the following benefits.
You glow with an orange light, shedding bright 
light out to a 30-foot radius and dim light for an 
additional 30 feet. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet.

Whenever a creature moves to within 10 feet of 
you, starts its turn there, or hits you with a melee 
attack, that creature takes 5d10 fire damage. You 
have immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, 
and fire damage.

You can cast fireball as a 3rd-level spell without 
expending a spell slot. Whenever you roll fire 
damage for a spell you cast, roll dice that are one 
step larger than normal. For example, a spell that 
normally deals 8d6 fire damage would deal 8d8 fire 
damage instead.
