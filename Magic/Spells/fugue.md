- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature violin bow made of platinum worth at least 250 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You select a point within range, and a discordant
melody plays eerily to all creatures within a 30-foot
radius. Each creature that starts its turn within the
area must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature takes 4d6 psychic damage, and
can't take reactions. On a successful save, the
creature takes half the damage, and doesn't lose its
reaction.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
4th.
