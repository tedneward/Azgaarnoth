Your touch corrupts your victim's very soul,
damaging some of its mental characteristics. Make a
melee spell attack against a creature within your
reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage
and has disadvantage on Wisdom checks, Wisdom
saving throws, Charisma checks, and Charisma
saving throws. At the end of the target's next turn, it
must make an Intelligence saving throw. If it
succeeds, the spell ends. If it fails, it may make
another Intelligence saving throw 1 minute later. If
it succeeds, the spell ends. If it fails, the spells
effects last for the duration.
This spell can also be ended with greater
restoration , heal, or wish. However, the caster of a
greater restoration or heal spell must choose to
affect either the Wisdom or Charisma of the target
of this spell. Only the effects of this spell on ability
checks and saving throws for the selected ability are
affected. Thus, it requires two castings of greater
restoration  or heal (or one of each) to remove all the
effects of this spell.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
5th.
