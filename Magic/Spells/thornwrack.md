#### Thornwrack
*5th-level transmutation* (Druid,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a thorny vine)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Thorns sprout from your target's bones. The thorns
dig into your target's body, making movement
tremendously painful. Your target must make a
Constitution saving throw, take 6d10 piercing
damage on a failure, and half as much on a success.
On a success, the spell ends, but on a failure, at the
end of each of the target's turns for the duration,
the target takes 2d10 magical piercing damage if it
moved during its turn, as the thorns grind into the
target's joints. If the target took the Dash action
during that turn, the damage is doubled. The target
can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end
of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.
