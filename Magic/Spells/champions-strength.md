Choose five willing humanoid creatures within range, and designate one as the champion. The other four people may sacrifice some of their strength and combat prowess to the champion. The choice of whether to do so must be made immediately when the spell is cast.

If at least one creature chooses to make the sacrifice, for the duration, it gains disadvantage on attack rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws, but the champion gains advantage on those same rolls. If more than one creature chooses to make the sacrifice, each of the other sacrificing creatures also gains disadvantage on attack rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws, for the duration but the champion inflicts an extra 1d12+5 force damage on melee attacks and attacks with thrown weapons for each creature that made the sacrifice beyond the first.

All penalties and bonuses granted by this spell last until it ends, regardless of whether any or all of the targets remain within range or change their minds.
