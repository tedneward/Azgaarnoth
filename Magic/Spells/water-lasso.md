# Water Lasso
*3rd-level conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a rope at least 20 feet long)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a lasso made of water. Make a ranged spell attack against a target that you can see within range. On a hit, the water lasso wraps its watery coils around the target, and the target is restrained. The creature can make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC at the end of each of its turns to break free from the lasso. On each of your turns, if the target is still restrained by the water lasso, you can pull the target up to 10 feet in a straight line toward you.
