#### Living Burial
*7th-level transmutation* (Druid,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bone taken from a grave)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
The ground opens beneath one creature on the ground that you can see within range. The target must make a Strength saving throw as magically fluid earth sucks it downward into the ground. On a failed saving throw, it takes 7d8 bludgeoning damage and it is pulled 10 feet under the ground and [buried](../Conditions/Buried.md) until the spell ends. On a success, it takes half as much damage and it isn't pulled or buried. 

Until the spell ends, at the end of each of the target's turns while it is still buried, it takes 4d8 nonmagical bludgeoning damage. It can use an action on its turn to attempt to dig upward, making a Strength check against your spellcasting DC. If it succeeds or if the spell ends early, the target makes it up to the surface and is only 
partially stuck in the ground.

While partially stuck, a creature is restrained by the ground itself. It can use an action on its turn to attempt to escape the ground. It makes a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself, falling prone on the ground.

If the spell lasts its full duration, the target remains buried permanently, until it escapes or is rescued.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 7th.
