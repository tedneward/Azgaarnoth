*Conjuration cantrip* (Pale Master,Wizard)
___

- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S, M (an empty vial)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You pull shadows into a swirling mass inside an empty vial you possess. As long as the vial is open, you are able to use its new contents as 1 ounce of pitch-black ink. If the vial is stoppered, or 1-hour passes, the ink dissipates back into shadow; any writing that has already been made with the ink is unaffected.
