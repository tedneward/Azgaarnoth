#### Gravity Ward
*2nd-level transmutation* *(ritual)* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 day
---
You ward a two-dimensional area up to five consecutive 5-foot squares, with a gravity ward. Unless a creature knows the password, any creature touching the surface of the ward is affected by the increased gravity of the area. Affected creatures must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have their movement speed reduced by half. The area of the ward is also considered difficult terrain for affected creatures. Triggering the ward does not dispel it, and dispel magic can remove five 5-foot squares.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can ward an additional five 5-foot squares, and the effect lasts an additional day, for each slot level above 2nd. If you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, the effect lasts until dispelled.
