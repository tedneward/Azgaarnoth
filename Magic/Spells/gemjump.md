This spell links two specially prepared gems. One of
the gems is usually kept at a safe location, and the
other one carried until it is needed. Once you cast
this spell, you can be transported to the location of
one of the gems by holding the other one in your
hand and speaking its command word as a bonus
action.

You can transport up to six willing Medium size
or smaller creatures with you, none of which can be
carrying gear in excess of their carrying capacity.
Once you transport yourself with this effect, the
spell ends.
