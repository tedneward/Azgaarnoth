You conjure a 20 foot by 20 foot wall of grey fog.
Hungry faces appear in the fog whenever a
spellcaster gets within 10 feet. The first creature to
come into contact with the wall is hit with a 3rd
level dispel magic as if it was cast by the same caster
who conjured the wall. Once a creature has come
into contact with the wall, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
5th level or higher spell, you may increase the level
of dispel magic by one level for every spell level
above 4th.
