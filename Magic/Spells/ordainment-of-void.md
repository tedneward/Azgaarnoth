Your body transforms entirely into magical thought for the duration, granting you the following benefits: 
* You are immune to force damage and you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. 
* You ignore the effects of disease, exhaustion, and poisons. Any poisons or diseases already in your system are suspended, not neutralized.
* You cannot be grappled, restrained, or touched. You can touch others, but you cannot grapple creatures or hold objects. You can enter the spaces of other creatures and stop there. 
* All attacks against you are made with disadvantage. 
* You can use a bonus action on your turn to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. 
* You are invisible, make no sound, and leave no smell However, when you cast a spell that uses somatic components, light flashes in your space, and when you cast a spell that uses verbal components, a howling sound can be heard from your space. Any objects you are carrying are also invisible, silent, and undetectable so long as they fit within your space. 
* When a spell that you cast deals psychic damage, it ignores resistance to psychic damage, and it deals extra psychic damage equal to 10 + twice the spell's level (18). A spell can't deal this extra damage to any creature more than once per turn.
