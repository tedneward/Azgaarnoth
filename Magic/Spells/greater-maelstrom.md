You create a 120-foot wide by 60-foot deep swirling
vortex that forms in a water source you can see
within range. If the water source isn't at least the
size of the vortex, the spell fails. A creature in the
water that is caught within 60 feet of the vortex
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature is sucked into the vortex's
swirling waters.

A creature that starts its turn within the vortex's
swirling waters must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6
bludgeoning damage, and it is sucked 10 feet closer
to the vortex's center. On a successful save, the
creature doesn't take damage, and isn't sucked
closer to the vortex's center. In addition, the
creature can use its action to make a Strength
(Athletics) check to swim away from the vortex's
center. On a success, the creature can swim at half
its speed, unless it has a swimming speed, in which
case it can use this full movement. On a failed
check, the creature doesn't make any progress.

A creature that starts its turn in the vortex's
center, must make a Strength saving throw. On a
failed save, the creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning
damage and it is sucked 10 feet below the water's
surface. A creature that reaches the vortex's bottom,
60 feet below the surface, is ejected a further 20 feet
from below the vortex's center.
