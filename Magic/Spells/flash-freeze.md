You cause a sudden, extreme dip in temperature that freezes everything within an isolated area. Every creature within a 50-foot cube centered on a point you can see must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 cold damage, has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws, grants advantage to attacks made against it, and has its speed reduced by 25 feet until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

Nonmagical fires in the affected area are extinguished and unattended liquids are frozen. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a slot of 8th level or higher, then you increase the damage by 1d6 per level higher than 7th.
