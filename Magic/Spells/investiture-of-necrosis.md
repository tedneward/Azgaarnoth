# Investiture of Necrosis
*6th-level transmutation* (Pale Master, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Necrotic energies race across your body, shedding dim light in a 60-foot radius for the spell's duration. The necrosis doesn't harm you. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits:

* You are immune to necrotic damage and resistant to poison damage.
* Any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 1d10 necrotic damage.
* You can use your action to create a line of necrotic energy 15 feet long and 5 feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
