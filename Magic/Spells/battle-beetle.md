You a summon fey spirit, which takes the form of a huge [beetle](/Creatures/Beetle.md) (stats as a Mammoth but gains 30 ft. fly speed) that appears in unoccupied space that you can see within range. The beast is considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creature is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands, it will defend itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

Up to 5 creatures of medium size or smaller can mount the beetle at a time, but it only responds to commands given by you.
