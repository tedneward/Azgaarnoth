---
You grant an undead servant the ability to cast a
spell you know one time. Choose a spell you could
cast using a spell slot. You sacrifice the spell slot
you would use to cast it, and the undead creature
you touch gains the ability to cast that spell once
before the next time you finish a long rest. You
cannot force the undead to cast the spell unless you
have some other means of controlling it.
