You create a whip made of psychic energy, which sparks pain but also fortifies will. It counts as a simple melee weapon that you're proficient with, and you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using it. It deals 2d4 psychic damage, and has the reach property.

Until the spell ends, in addition to using the whip normally as a weapon, you can also use the whip on a willing creature as a bonus action. When you do so, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your proficiency bonus plus your spellcasting ability modifier, which cannot be reduced by any means. However, the next time that creature rolls a saving throw before the end of its next turn, it makes the saving throw with advantage.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a 2nd or 3rd level slot, the damage is 3d4. If the spell slot is 4th or 5th level, it's 4d4. If you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, it's 5d4.
