With a word, you call positive energy into the target's body to heal and ward it. The target regains a number of hit points equal to 4d10 + 30. It also gains temporary hit points equal to half that amount and resistance to all damage, both lasting until the end of your next turn.

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the healing increases by 2d10 for each slot level above 7th.
