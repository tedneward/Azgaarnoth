___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a glass bead, consumed by the spell)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You touch the surface of an open surfaced body of liquid, freezing the top part to produce a ﬂoor of ice out to a 120-foot radius from where you touched the liquid (certain types of liquid, such as lava, may be unaffected). The ice is 2 feet thick, has an AC of 12, and 60 hit points per 10-foot square section. Large and smaller creatures can travel on the ice without breaking or sinking it, at least within the first few minutes (the DM’s discretion applies in this case).

Alternatively, when you cast this spell, you can have the ice spread out over a 25-foot wide, 1,000-foot-long line originating from the point of contact.

Every creature within the affected area as the ice freezes must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained in the ice. A restrained creature can use an action for a DC 15 Strength check (+3 bonus per size category beyond Medium) to pull itself out of the icy restraint (damaging the surrounding ice will reduce the DC). Huge and Gargantuan creatures, as well as creatures small enough to be encapsulated in the ice, automatically fail the saving throw.
