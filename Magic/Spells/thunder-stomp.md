For the duration, you produce a thunderous boom every time you take a step. Whenever you travel 5 feet while moving on a solid surface with your feet, every creature within 5 feet must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 thunder damage and becoming deafened until the start of your next turn on a failed save. In addition, you gain resistance to thunder damage, advantage on Constitution saving throws made against effects that cause the deafened condition, and immunity to the damaging and deafening effects of this spell until the spell ends.
