At your touch, maggots begin writhing out of your enemy's flesh. Make a melee spell attack. If you hit, the target takes 4d10 necrotic damage and must make Wisdom save. On a failure, it is frightened of you for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, it can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it is no longer frightened.
