You fill the area with overwhelming electrical power.

Each creature which enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 lightning damage and is [stunned](../../Conditions/Stunned.md) until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not stunned.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can  change the direction of the spell's area.
