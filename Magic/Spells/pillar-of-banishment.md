A brightly glowing image of two rotating circles of glyphs appears, then a vertical column of disorienting violet luminescence erupts from one circle to the other. Each creature in a 10-ft. radius, 40-foot cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature is blinded on a failed save, and must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness while a failed save transports the creature to another plane of existence and also ends the blindness. (If the creature was not on its home plane, it will typically be banished home, while other creatures will be sent to the Astral or Ethereal planes.)

If a creature banished by this spell is native to the plane of existence you are currently on, it can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the creature returns to the same location where it was banished, or the closest unoccupied space if the original location is occupied.
