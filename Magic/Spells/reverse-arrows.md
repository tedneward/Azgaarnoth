___

- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Ranged attacks with nonmagical missiles have
disadvantage to hit you for the duration. If a missile
misses you due to this disadvantage, then the
missile is turned back upon your attacker. If that
happens, you can use your reaction to make a
ranged spell attack against the attacker. On a hit,
the target takes the normal damage that ranged
weapon would inflict, substituting your spellcasting
ability modifier for Strength or Dexterity for the
damage roll.
In addition, you have resistance to damage from
nonmagical missiles for the duration.
