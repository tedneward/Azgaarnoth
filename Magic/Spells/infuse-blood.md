- **Duration:** 8 hours
---
You touch a willing creature with blood and infuse its blood with magic and vitality. The target has advantage on saving throws against nonmagical disease until the spell ends.

In addition, the first time the target takes damage that reduces its hit points to less than half of its maximum hit points, it bursts with light and energy, ending the spell early. It gains 4d6 temporary hit points which disappear after 1 minute, and each creature of the target's choice within 10 feet of the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 2d6 radiant damage.

***At Higher Levels.***When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the temporary hit points gained increase by 2d6 and the radiant damage dealt increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
