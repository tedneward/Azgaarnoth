A hooked chain of magical force blasts forth from your hand to strike a creature and drain magic from its body. This spell will fail if the target is not a spellcasting creature within one size category of you that uses spell slots. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 force damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save, you take one unspent spell slot from the creature at the highest spell level that it can use from 1st level to 3rd level.The spell slot granted using this spell remains usable until you take a short rest or long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
