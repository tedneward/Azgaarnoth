Each creature within range, other than you, must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage as you cause the blood within the veins of surrounding creatures to slow and curdle. Creatures without blood automatically succeed on the saving throw. Saving throws made to maintain concentration as a result of the spell's damage have disadvantage.

The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
