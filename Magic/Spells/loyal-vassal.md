When you cast the spell, select up to six creatures
within 5 feet of you. You touch each of these
creatures as part of the action of casting this spell.
Until the spell ends, each chosen creature gains
advantage on Wisdom saving throws against
enchantment spells, effects that would cause them
to become charmed or frightened, and effects that
would force them to obey another creature's
commands. If a subject of this spell is already under
the influence of such an effect, it can immediately
attempt another saving throw against that effect
when you cast this spell.
