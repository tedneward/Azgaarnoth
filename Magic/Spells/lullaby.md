This spell sends a creature into a magical slumber. Roll 3d4; this is the amount of hit points this spell can affect. Compare this amount to the hit points of a creature you can see within range of the spell. If the total equals or exceeds the target's hit points, it falls unconscious until the spell ends, the target takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If the total is less than the target's hit points, it has disadvantage on Wisdom based skill checks until the spell ends or someone takes a hostile action against it.

The amount of hit points this spell can affect increases by 2d4 when you reach 5th level (5d4), 11th level (7d4), and 17th level (9d4).
