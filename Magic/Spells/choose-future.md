___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (two grains of sand and a rose petal)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You alter the luck of a creature you touch. The
creature gains three d20 luck dice to use before the
duration expires. The creature can roll a luck die
after rolling a d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or
saving throw, but before the Dungeon Master says
whether the result was successful or not; the
creature can choose which result to use. Only one
luck die can be used per attack roll, ability check, or
saving throw.
