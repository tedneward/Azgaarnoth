You evoke a spherical orb of unstable elemental energy that ﬂoats above your hand and lasts for the duration. You need a free hand to maintain the orb; the orb is dismissed if you use the hand for any other purpose, but you can evoke the orb again as a bonus action.When you cast this spell, roll 1d6. The result determines the initial damage type of the elemental orb.

* **1** - Acid (corrosive liquid)
* **2** - Cold (frigid air)
* **3** - Fire (burning ﬂame)
* **4** - Lightning (crackling lightning)
* **5** - Thunder (distorted air)
* **6** - Bludgeoning (ﬂoating stones)

You can use an action to make a ranged spell attack with the orb against a creature or object of your choice you can see within 120 feet. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 damage of the type rolled for the orb. After making the attack, the orb immediately returns to you.When you end your turn, roll again for the orb’s damage type. If the result is different, the orb’s damage type changes to the new result.

If the orb’s damage type is fire or lightning, it sheds bright light in a 20-ft. radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every slot level above 3rd.
