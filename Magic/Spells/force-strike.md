As part of the action used to cast this spelL you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one target within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. Your reach for this melee attack is the range of the spell instead of its normal reach and the attack also counts as a ranged spell attack.

Your weapon projects a wave of magical force in the shape of the blow toward your target. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, except the weapon deals force damage for this attack instead of its normal damage type. 

This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th leveL the attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage. At 11th level this increases to 2d8 bonus damage, and at 17th level the bonus increases to 3d8.
