---
You channel your own most horrific memories to emit a field of painful psionic energy that disrupts attempts at magical spying. 

For the duration, any creature that attempts to cast a divination spell that targets a creature within 30 feet of you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 6d6 psychic damage on a failure, and half as much on a success.

Whether or not the creature fails the saving throw, if the divination spell it attempted to cast is 3rd level or less, then that spell also automatically fails, as if it had been countered with [counterspell](counterspell.md).
