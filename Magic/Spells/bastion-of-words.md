When tensions erupt into battle, you can exclaim a
magically empowered warning that distracts your
foes, giving you time to move somewhere safer. Roll
7d8 and add the results together, then make a
Charisma (Deception) check and add your result to
that total. The final total is how many hit points of
creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within
range of you that are hostile to you are affected in
ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring
unconscious creatures and creatures that cannot see
or hear you).
Starting with the creature that has the lowest
current hit points, each creature affected by this
spell is incapacitated and restrained until the end of
the current turn. At the beginning of your next
turn, each affected creature becomes incapacitated
and restrained again until the end of that turn, at
which point the spell ends.
Subtract each creature's hit points from the total
before moving on to the creature with the next
lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be
equal to or less than the remaining total for that
creature to be affected. If you attack one or more
affected creatures, harm one or more of them with a
spell, or force one or more of them to make a saving
throw, this spell's effects end immediately. Undead,
constructs, and creatures immune to being charmed
aren't affected by this spell.
