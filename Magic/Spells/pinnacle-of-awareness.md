You enchant your mind and senses, becoming a
master of observation and deductive reasoning. For
the duration, you can't be surprised, ranged attack
rolls made against you cannot benefit from
advantage, and whenever you hit with an attack
roll, you deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to one
target of that attack. In addition, until the spell
ends, you have advantage on all of the following
rolls:
* Dexterity saving throws
* Dexterity checks for initiative
* Intelligence (Investigation, Nature, or History)
checks
* Wisdom (Insight, Perception, or Survival)
checks
After the spell ends, you have advantage on all
ability checks to accurately recall anything you saw
or heard while the spell was active.
This spell ends early if you hit the same creature
with an attack roll more than once.
