Invisible, repulsive force explodes with a dull rumbling sound from a point you can see in a 20-foot radius sphere, pushing away creatures and unattended objects. Every creature in the affected area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 40 feet from the point of origin and must make a DC 10 Dexterity check to avoid falling prone. On a successful save, the creature is pushed 10 feet.The amount of forced movement is halved for Huge creatures and objects as well as creatures and objects weighing more than 2,000 lb. Gargantuan creatures and objects as well as creatures and objects weighing more than 20,000 lb. are immune to this spell.If the creature’s or object’s forced movement is interrupted by impact with an obstruction such as a wall, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it still had yet to be pushed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you increase the distance of the push by 10 feet for each slot level higher than 3rd.
