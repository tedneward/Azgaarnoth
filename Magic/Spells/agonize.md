___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 60 feet 
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 
---
You wrack one creature that you can see within range with agonizing magical pain. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or else become stunned for the duration. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success. 

When a creature that has blood and less than half of its hit points fails the saving throw, it takes 1d6 psychic damage. This damage can't reduce it below 1 hit point. Creatures that can't be charmed have advantage on the saving throw. This spell has no effect on constructs and undead.

This is a Blood spell.
