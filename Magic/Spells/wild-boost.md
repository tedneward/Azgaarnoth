This is one of the most reckless spells in the history of magic, researched by a mad mage who had been studying the unpredictable surges of wild magic sorcerers. You can not cast this spell while concentrating on a spell. By applying disruptive energies into your body, you gain a temporary boost of raw magical power. When you cast another spell before the end of your next turn, the new spell is cast as if it were cast with a spell slot two levels higher, this spell ends, and you must roll once on the sorcerer class’ Wild Surge table. The effect that you rolled is activated by you. If you roll a result of 99-00, reroll the result unless you actually have expended sorcery points. If you cast the new spell in a wild magic zone, roll twice instead for the wild surge and activate both results.If you take damage from an attack or an area effect before you cast another spell, this spell ends and you must roll once on the sorcerer class’ Wild Surge table.
