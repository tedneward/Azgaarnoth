---
You inflict a wound upon yourself and sculpt the flowing, crimson blood into a blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it splatters blood in a 5-foot radius and the spell ends. Each other creature in the radius must make a Dexterity saving or suffer 1d6 necrotic damage.

You can use you action to make a melee spell attack with the crimson blade. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 necrotic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn.

While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest route available on its turn, unless there is nowhere to move.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or 6th level, the damage increases by 2d6 for every two slots above 2nd.

***Blood Magic.*** When you cast this spell, you must expend 2 hit dice plus an additional 2 hit dice for every two slots above 2nd. At the end of the duration, gain one level of [exhaustion](../../Conditions/Exhaustion.md). This level of exhaustion lasts until you finish a short rest.
