Creatures within a 10 foot radius 30 foot high cylinder centered on a point you choose within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 poison damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful one. The ground under the cylinder becomes a sticky morass as the earth and stone dissolve. The area covered by the cylinder becomes difficult terrain for 10 minutes after he spell is cast.

***At Higher Levels.*** You can cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher. You can increase the radius of the cylinder by 10 feet or the damage by 1d6 for each spell level above 4th.
