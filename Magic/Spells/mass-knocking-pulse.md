You send a ï¬‚ow of kinetic energy into the ground, which curves upwards toward every Medium or smaller creature within 15 feet of you; the target must be on a surface connected to or in contact with the ground that you are currently on. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 30 feet upwards and must make a DC 15 Dexterity check to avoid falling prone on the landing.

If the creature impacts with a surface on the way up before it completes the entire 30 feet, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the impact for every 10 feet that was subtracted from the rising movement, and half damage on a success.
