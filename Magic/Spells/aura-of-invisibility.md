Choose up to six willing creatures you can see within range. Until the spell ends, you are [invisible](../../Conditions/Invisible.md), and each target is invisible while it is in range. While an affected creature is invisible, anything it is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the creature's person. At any time, it can choose to be visible until the start of its next turn. You and each target can see through the invisibility.
