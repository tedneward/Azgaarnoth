#### Storm Tower
*7th-level abjuration* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
A 20-foot radius by 100-foot high tower of storm
winds surrounds you. The swirling winds nullify any
lightning effects that contact the barrier. In
addition, ranged attacks through the barrier are
impossible. A creature that tries to pass through the
barrier must succeed on a Strength saving throw;
otherwise it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage from
the high winds, and it makes no progress. A
creature can make more than one attempt to cross
the barrier on its turn, but it receives one level of
exhaustion for each unsuccessful attempt beyond
the first.
Once the storm tower appears, it is stationary for
the duration, but you can move normally inside it.
