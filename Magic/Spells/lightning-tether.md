#### Lightning Tether
*8th-level evocation* (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (strands of glass filigree)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You cause tendrils of lightning to spring forth out 
of the ground, walls, ceilings, or other sturdy 
surfaces to grasp and hold your enemies. A number 
of creatures you can see up to twice your 
spellcasting ability modifier must each succeed on a 
Dexterity saving throw or be affected by the spell. A 
creature more than 20 feet from any solid surface is 
unaffected.

An affected creature is leashed by animated 
lightning and instantly pulled to its anchoring 
surface. The creature's speed becomes zero. At the 
beginning of an affected creature's turn, that 
creature takes 5d12 lightning damage.

A creature can break free by spending an action 
and succeeding on a Strength check against your 
spell save DC. Regardless of whether the check 
succeeds or fails, the creature takes 5d12 lightning 
damage as it strains against the tether.

If a tethered creature casts a spell, it must make a Constitution saving throw as though concentrating. On a failed save, the spell is wasted with no effect.
