#### Dreadful Warrior
*3rd-level conjuration* (Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You call forth the spirit of warrior
who shared your zealous faith in
life and returns now to harry your
foes. The spirit appears in an
unoccupied space you choose
within range and lasts for the
duration or until you cast this
spell again. Creatures of your
choice within 5 feet of the spirit
take a -2 penalty to Armor Class,
and you and creatures and
friendly to you treat the spirit as
an ally for the purposes of traits,
spells, and class features (such as
a rogue's sneak attack). Creatures
hostile to you cannot move
through the spirit's space. When a
creature leaves a space within 5
feet of the spirit, you can use your
reaction to make a melee spell
attack against that creature. On a
hit, the target takes psychic
damage equal to 1d10 + your
spellcasting ability modifier. On a
miss, the target still takes psychic damage equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the
warrior up to 30 feet to any unoccupied space.
The spirit shares your race and wears armor of a
past age. Clerics of deities who are associated with a
particular symbol or weapon (such as the black
hand of Bane or the flaming sword of Tempus)
usually conjure a dreadful warrior bearing that
symbol or weapon.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level of or higher, the damage
increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 3rd.
