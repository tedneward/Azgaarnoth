*Enchantment cantrip (Artificer,Bard,Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against a
creature within range, otherwise the spell fails. On a
hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects,
and your enchanted strike shows an ally of your
choice within 5 feet of either you or the target how
to hit your foe where it hurts. That ally has
advantage on the next attack roll it makes against
the target before the start of your next turn. If that
attack hits, it inflicts an extra 1d6 radiant damage
and the spell ends.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, your melee attack deals
an extra 1d6 radiant damage to the target, and the
extra radiant damage from an ally's strike increases
to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th
level and 17th level.
