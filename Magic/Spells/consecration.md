# Consecration
*2nd-level abjuration* (Cleric, Paladin)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch (15-foot-radius circle)

**Components:** V, S, M (a holy symbol, vial of holy water and incense worth 20 gp, which is consumed)

**Duration:** 1 minute

Divine energy spreads outwards from a point you touch on the ground to fill up to a 15-foot-radius circle for the duration. The energy spreads around corners. For the duration, creatures of your choosing within the circle have advantage on Wisdom saving throws and skill checks. An undead creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to willingly enter the area, and suffers disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and skill checks while inside the area.

When the spell ends, the area is blessed by positive energy and becomes consecrated ground. If the area contains an altar, shrine, or other permanent fixture devoted to a deity, pantheon, or higher power with ideals vastly different from those represented by the holy symbol used in the casting, it is destroyed.
