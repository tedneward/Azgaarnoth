Every creature in the path, a 60-foot long, 5-foot wide line, must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or none on a successful save.At the end of the ring’s ﬂight path, the ring explodes in a 5-foot radius. Every creature in the explosion’s area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save.
