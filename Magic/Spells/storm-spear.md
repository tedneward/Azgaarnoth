#### Storm Spear
*7th-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 120 feet 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 
---
You form lightning into a crackling spear of energy, which you use to either make one melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of you or one ranged spell attack against a target that you can see within range. Then the spear vanishes. 

On a hit, the target takes 6d8 + 20 lightning damage, and if it isn't immune to the damage, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it falls prone and becomes paralyzed and stunned for the duration. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. On a miss, the target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects from the spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 7th.
