---
You sever a hand from your body and grant it sentience. Your hand becomes a [crawling claw](/Creatures/Crawling-Claw.md) with the creature's game statistics, except that it gains proficiency in the sleight of hand and stealth skills, and has advantage on checks made with these skills.

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command it if the crawling claw is within 1 mile of you. You decide what action the crawling claw will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command. If you issue no commands, the crawling claw only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the crawling claw continues to follow it until its task is complete.

You can use a bonus action to reattach the crawl claw to your body, returning your hand to normal. The crawling claw is under your control for 24 hours, after which you must reattach it to your body or it dies. If the crawling claw dies by any means, it cannot be reattached to your body unless by magical means (such as a [regenerate](./regenerate.md) spell).

***At Higher Levels:*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the crawling claw is under your control for 10 days. If you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the crawling claw is under your control for 90 days. If you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the crawling claw is under your control for a year and 1 day.
