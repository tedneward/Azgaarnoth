You evoke ammunition of solid magical force into your hand as you nock your bow or aim your crossbow. For the duration, whenever you make a ranged weapon attack with a bow or crossbow, the ammunition for the attack is automatically loaded with arrows or bolts of magical force. The ammunition deals the same damage die and damage type as the standard nonmagical ammunition, except the arrows and bolts created by this spell are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity. The ammunition disappears at the start of your next turn.
