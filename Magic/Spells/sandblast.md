# Sandblast
*1st-level conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (15-foot cone)

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of sand)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

Sand sprays from your outstretched hand with enough force to pierce flesh and scour surfaces. Each creature within a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The sandblast deals the same damage to objects and structures in its area.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
