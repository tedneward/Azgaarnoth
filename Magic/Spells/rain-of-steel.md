You enter a trancelike state of mystical combat awareness, sensing the approach of enemies and protectively whirling your weapon around to strike them with supernatural speed. 

When you cast this spell, until the start of your next turn, when a creature starts its turn within 5 feet of you, it takes 1d8 force damage.

Until the spell ends, whenever a creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to reactivate this effect, causing the triggering creature and any other hostile creature that start its turn within 5 feet of you until the start of your next turn to take 1d8 force damage.
