**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Special

This spell can be cast in conjunction with a 1st level spell that has a casting time of 1 action and a duration of instantaneous, allowing you to break the restrictions on casting two spells on the same turn. It augments the second spell, allowing it to have maximum impact with regards to any variable component or effect of the spell, such as the number of damage dice rolled. A 1st level *emparadweomer* can only affect a 1st level spell.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can increase the level of the augmented spell by 1 for each slot level above 1st.
