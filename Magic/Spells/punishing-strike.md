#### Punishing Strike
*Necromancy cantrip (Druid,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make an unarmed strike or melee weapon
attack against one creature within the spell's range,
otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers
the attack's normal effects. In addition, a black web
of necrotic energy radiates across its skin from
where it was struck until the start of your next turn.
If the target willingly takes a reaction before then, it
immediately takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and the
spell ends.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an
extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target, and the
damage the target suffers for taking a reaction
increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8
at 11th level and 17th level.
