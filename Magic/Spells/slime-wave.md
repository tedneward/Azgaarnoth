#### Slime Wave
*7th-level conjuration* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a few drops of stagnant pond water)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
A 20-foot radius area you can see within range is
chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Each
creature in the area is also covered in a patch of
green slime. A creature moving through the area
must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw for every
5 feet travelled to avoid being covered in a patch of
green slime.
You can use an action to cause the area of slime
to move in a wave up to 10 feet in a direction you
choose. Any creatures in the area of the wave are
covered in a patch of green slime. Any creature that
was previously covered by the slime, but no longer
in its area, must still deal with the green slime as
normal.
