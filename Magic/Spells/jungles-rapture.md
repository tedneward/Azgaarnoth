---
Spitting, you curse a creature, causing its body to
become more rigid, and whorls of wood grain to
appear on its skin as it begins a slow transformation
into a tree. Choose a creature within your range
that is not undead or a construct, which must make
a Wisdom saving throw . On a failure, you curse the
creature with a hardening of the limbs and skin as
its flesh slowly turns to wood, inflicting the
following effects upon it for the duration :
* Any speed it has becomes 5 feet, unless the
speed was lower.
* It has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and
Dexterity saving throws.
At the end of each of the target's turns, it must
make a Wisdom saving throw. After succeeding on
three of these saving throws, the creature defeats
the curse, and the spell ends. After failing three of
these saving throws, the creature stops making
these saves, and it becomes a tree, replacing the
previous effects of the curse with the following,
which last for the duration :
* Its creature type becomes plant
* It is restrained
* Its size becomes Large unless it was already
larger
* Its reach with melee attacks increases to 10 feet
* It has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and
Charisma checks
* It cannot speak any language
* It is indistinguishable from a normal tree unless
it moves
Every morning at dawn, the creature must make
another Wisdom saving throw. Whenever it
succeeds, it regains the ability to speak until the
next time it fails the saving throw. If it succeeds on
two of these saving throws in a row, the spell ends.
A greater restoration  spell can also end this spell.
