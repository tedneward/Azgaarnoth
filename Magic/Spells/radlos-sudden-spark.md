# Radlo's Sudden Spark
*1st-level evocation* (Artificer, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you hit with a melee weapon attack or are hit by a melee weapon attack 
- **Range:** Self 
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You electrify the attacker's weapon as it strikes its target. The spell deals a creature 2d6 lightning damage on a failed Constitution saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful save. If the attack was a critical hit, the damage increases by 1d6.

The spell's target is determined by who made the triggering attack: 

* **Defensive.** If you were hit by the triggering attack, the attacker rolls the saving throw, with disadvantage if it used a metal weapon to make the attack. On a failed saving throw, it also drops the weapon used in the attack. 
* **Offensive.** If you made the triggering attack, the target of your attack rolls the saving throw, with disadvantage if it is wearing armor made of metal. On a failed saving throw, it also can't take reactions until the start of your next turn. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
