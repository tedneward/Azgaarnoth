You make a creature highly susceptible to attacks.

that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, all attacks against the target are
made with advantage. The affected creature can
make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of
each of its turns. On a successful save, the spell
ends. This effect can't be dispelled, but a remove
curse negates it.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
