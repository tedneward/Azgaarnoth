___

You conjure a spectral whip that sparkles with
crimson colored darkfire. As part of the action used
to cast the spell, and by using an action on each of
your turns, you can make a melee spell attack
against a creature of your choice within 10 feet. On
a hit, the creature takes 5d4 necrotic damage, and if
it is a living creature, it must make a Strength
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature drops
whatever it is holding as it is wracked with
excruciating pain.
Alternatively, you can lash out with the whip and
make a melee spell attack against up to three
creatures that are within 10 feet of you and who are
adjacent to each other. Make one melee spell attack
and compare the result to each target's AC. On a
hit, the creature takes 2d4 necrotic damage, and if it
is a living creature, it must make a Strength saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature drops whatever
it is holding due to the excruciating pain.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the necrotic
damage increases by 2d4 against a single target or
1d4 against multiple targets for every two slot levels
above 5th.
