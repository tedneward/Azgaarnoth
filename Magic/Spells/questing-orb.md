---
You construct a tiny, glowing, hovering orb of spectral force in your space that you can mentally command to ﬂy in any direction of your choice. The orb has a speed of 60 feet and can pass freely through creatures, objects, and solid obstructions, but can not travel more than 100 feet away from you. You can use a bonus action to move the orb, and you don’t need to see it to move it. You are aware of where the orb is at all times (though you can’t see or hear through it) and know if it is passing through a creature, object, or solid obstruction (or vice versa).

You can use an action to make the orb explode, damaging creatures and objects nearby in a 10-foot radius sphere. Every creature within the affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 force damage on a failed save, and takes half damage on a successful save. The orb can explode only if it is completely in unoccupied space.The orb sheds bright light in a radius of 20 feet, and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If the orb is touched by a creature on the Border Ethereal, such as a ghost, or damaged by a magical effect, it immediately explodes. The orb disappears when the spell ends and the spell ends when the orb explodes.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
