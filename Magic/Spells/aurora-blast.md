You call upon the frigid power of arctic nights, summoning multicolored beams of light to strike your foes with supernatural cold.

Eight beams of vivid light streak down from the sky at points you choose within range. Each beam is 10 feet wide, and each must strike a different point, although a big enough creature may be struck by multiple beams.

A creature struck by one or more beams must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 20d6 cold damage per beam on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
