# Hallowing Curse
*4th-level necromancy* (Bard, Cleric, Pale Master, Shaman, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, an ill omen is placed on the target, causing disadvantage on Strength and Constitution ability checks and saving throws for the duration. While cursed, the target gains 5d10 worth of negative temporary hit points. These negative temporary hit points must be healed through before a target's normal hit points can be healed. A [remove curse](/Magic/Spells/remove-curse.md) spell ends this effect.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the Duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the Duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a Duration that doesn't require Concentration.
