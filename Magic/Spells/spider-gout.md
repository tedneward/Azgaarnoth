___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a dead spider)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You
spit a glob of congealed
spider venom at your foe. Make a ranged spell
attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the
target hit takes 2d4 poison damage and the sticky
spider venom forces it to make a Strength saving
throw at the end of its next turn. On a failure, it
takes an additional 2d4 poison damage. On a
success, it scrapes the sticky poison off and the spell
ends. For the duration, the target must repeat the
Strength saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, taking 2d4 poison damage on a failure and
ending the spell with a success.
