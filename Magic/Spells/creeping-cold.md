#### Creeping Cold
*2nd-level transmutation* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 3 rounds
---
You point at a target within range, and begin to
turn its body moisture into ice.
The target makes a Constitution saving throw. If
the creature fails, at the beginning of its next turn,
the target takes cold damage equal to 1d6 + your
spellcasting ability modifier. The creature takes cold
damage at the beginning of its next two turns as
well, equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability
modifier at the beginning of its second turn after
the spell is cast, and 3d6 + your spellcasting ability
modifier at the beginning of its third.
If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, it
still takes damage at the start of its next three turns,
but the damage is halved.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the amount of
cold damage taken at the start of each turn
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
