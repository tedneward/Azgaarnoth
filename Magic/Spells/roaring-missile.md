#### Roaring Missile
*6th-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You create three hovering missiles of magical force that launch with a rumbling noise at creatures or objects of your choice, impacting with a deafening boom on impact. Make a ranged weapon attack with each missile against the same or different targets. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 force damage, 3d6 thunder damage, and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is deafened until it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw made at the start of each of its turns. Huge creatures have advantage on the saving throw, and Gargantuan creatures are not deafened by this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you create an additional missile for each slot level above 6th.
