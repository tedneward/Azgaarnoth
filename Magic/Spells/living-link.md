You establish a link to one sense of a living creature
you can see within range. You can choose either
sight, hearing, or smell. You can perceive what the
target experiences through the chosen sense,
gaining any special senses the creature possesses.
However, your own sense of that type doesn't
function while you are linked to the creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can choose
one additional sense and the range increases by 100
feet for every two slot levels above 1st.
