#### Ordainment of Storms
*9th-level transmutation* (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** Self 
- **Components:** V, S, M (an amber or topaz worth at least S00gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
---
Your body transforms entirely into magical clouds for the duration. Choose either lightning or thunder damage. 

You gain the following benefits while transformed: 

* You are immune to lightning damage and you have resistance to all damage except thunder damage. 
* You ignore the effects of disease, exhaustion, and poisons. Any poisons or diseases already in your system are suspended, not neutralized.
* You cannot be grappled or restrained. 
* You have a flying speed of 60 feet, and you can hover. When the spell ends, you fall if you are still aloft, unless you can stop the fall. 
* When a spell you cast deals damage of the chosen type, it ignores resistance to that damage type, and it deals extra damage of that type equal to 10 + twice the spell's level. A spell can't deal this extra damage to any creature more than once per turn.
