You create a ﬂoating, intangible mote of luminescence in an unoccupied space. The mote sheds bright light out to 20 feet, and dim light an additional 20 feet. The mote remains stationary for a duration of 12 hours; the mote vanishes when its duration ends. When you create a mote with this spell, coils of light will stream out of the mote to connect with all other motes created by this spell within 1,000 feet if there are available paths between the motes, curving around corners and obstructions. If a connected mote ends its duration, the light coil(s) connecting to it also vanishes. A coil itself sheds bright light out to 10 feet, and dim light an additional 10 feet.
