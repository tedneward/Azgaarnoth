___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a corpse)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You touch a zombie or skeleton you control and it bursts into flames. After a few seconds, the zombie or skeleton is a roaring bonfire. For the duration, the zombie or skeleton is immune to fire and does an extra 2d6 fire damage with its melee attacks.

Until the spell ends, during each of your turns, you can use an action to cause the zombie or skeleton to explode. Every creature within 10 feet of the exploding zombie or skeleton when you do so must make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take 6d6 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
