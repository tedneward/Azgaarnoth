___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
Your empowered strike hurls your foe to the
ground, hobbles it with panic, and causes it to
flinch with terror at every nearby movement. Make
a melee spell attack against one creature within
range. On a hit, the target takes 7d12 psychic
damage and falls prone. The target must make a
Wisdom saving throw, if they fail the target is
frightened of you, and its speed is halved until the
start of your next round. Undead, constructs, and
creatures immune to being frightened aren't
affected by this spell.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 7th.
