#### Fire Spiders
*6th-level conjuration* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sulphur)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
A glowing yellow coal spurts from your finger to a
point you choose within range, and then bursts into
a 10-foot radius swarm of tiny spider-shaped fire
elementals.

A creature that starts its turn in the area must
make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire
damage on a failure or half as much on a success.
Each round, you can use a bonus action to move the
swarm up to 30 feet. If you do not move the swarm
at all during your turn, at the end of your turn it
moves up to 15 feet towards the nearest living
creature within range.

Any spell of 3rd level or higher that inflicts cold
damage ends the spell if it affects an area that
includes the swarm. If a spell prevents elementals
from entering a certain space (such as a magic circle
spell affecting elementals), it also prevents the
swarm from entering the space.
