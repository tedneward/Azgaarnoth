With an arcane gesture, you cause a creature you can see within range to burst into flames. The creature takes 2d8 fire damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. On a failure, the creature is [ablaze](../../Conditions/Ablaze.md) and takes an additional 1d6 damage on the start of each of its turns.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, for each slot level above 1st, the initial damage increases by 1d8 and the ongoing damage increases by 1d6.
