#### Dark Zone
*4th-level evocation* *(ritual)* (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a chunk of obsidian)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours
---
For the duration, all bright light becomes dim light, and all dim light becomes darkness within a 30-foot radius sphere centered upon a point you can see. If you cast this spell as a ritual, the spell does not require concentration to maintain. If you substitute a black opal worth at least 300 gp as a material component (consumed in the casting) for the ritual, the radius is doubled and the duration is permanent until dispelled.
