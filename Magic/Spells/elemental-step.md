You transform into a bolt of lightning and race instantly across the landscape, teleporting yourself to a location of your choice within range. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. 

When you arrive at your destination, you return to normal and a column of lightning crashes down around you in a 20-foot-radius, 200-foot-high cylinder centered on you. Flame blasts from you as welL filling a 40-foot radius sphere centered on you which spreads around corners. Each other creature in either area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 8d8 lightning damage if it's in the column and 10d6 fire damage if it's in the sphere, or half as much damage on a success.

Your arrival also creates a wave of seismic tremors in a 60-foot cube centered on a point of your choice. The cube extends through total cover and must contain your new space. It also creates a tide of freezing ice and mist in a 60-foot cone emanating from you. Other creatures in either area must each make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 4d12 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone if it's in the cube, and it takes 5d10 cold damage and has its speed reduced by 30 feet until the end of its next turn if it's in the cone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone or slowed.

Any ground in the cube is smashed and broken by the tremors. It becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-square portion of terrain requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

The spell damages objects, and it ignites flammable objects in the sphere or cylinder that aren't being worn or carried.
