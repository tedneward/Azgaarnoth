*2nd-level enchantment* (Bard,Cleric,Druid,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You target a Medium or smaller beast within range
and force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. The
creature you target must have a Challenge rating of
3 or less. On a failure, the creature is charmed by
you for the duration.

So long as the beast is charmed, you have a
telepathic link with it and can issue it simple
commands. If the beast receives no commands from
you, it waits and defends itself if attacked.
Any time the beast takes damage, it is allowed a
new Wisdom saving throw. If the save is successful,
the spell ends.

A Medim or smaller creature that is another
creature's familiar and has a Challenge rating of 3 or
less is always a valid target for this spell, even if it is
not a beast.
