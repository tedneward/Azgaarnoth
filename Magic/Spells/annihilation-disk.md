#### Annihilation Disk
*6th-level evocation* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You hurl a swirling disk of destructive force at one creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 8d6 + 15 force damage and the spell ends. This spell ignores resistance, and targets with vulnerability to slashing damage have vulnerability to the spell's damage.

On a miss, the disk flies past the target and begins flying through the air on its own, seeking out another target. Note the location of your target when you cast the spell. At the start of your next turn, you must repeat the spell attack (no action) against the creature within range that is now closest to that space, possibly even attacking yourself. If this attack misses or has no target, repeat this process using the location of the last target when the spell attacked it, repeating the attack each round until the spell ends.

The disk uses blindsight to find its targets, not vision, and it weaves around obstacles to reach its target, so subsequent attacks after the first ignore half cover and three-quarters cover and do not suffer disadvantage if you cannot see the target. If multiple creatures are tied for being the closest to the disk when you repeat the attack, you choose which one the disk attacks.

The disk damages objects in its path that aren't being worn or carried. When this spell destroys an object or kills a creature, it is sliced in twain.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage dealt increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 6th.
