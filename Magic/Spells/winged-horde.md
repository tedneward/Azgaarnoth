Swatting at your illusory horde of flesh-devouring
sprites or other creatures distracts your enemies
from your allies' maneuvers. Choose one creature
within range, or choose two creatures within range
that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it takes 1d4
psychic damage and it can't take reactions until the
start of its next turn.
The spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you
reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level
(4d4).
