Make a ranged spell attack against the target. If the target is within 5 feet of you, you can choose to make a melee spell attack against it instead. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage. 

The orb vanishes at the end of the turn. 

The spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10) 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10)
