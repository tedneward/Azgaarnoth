# Gale of Obscurity

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon a blizzard that obscures you from other creatures. For the duration, the gale provides you half cover, resistance to fire damage, and any creature that starts its turn or moves within 5 feet of you for the first time takes 1d6 cold damage.

While the gale is active, you suffer disadvantage on all ranged weapon and spell attacks.
