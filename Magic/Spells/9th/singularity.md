# Singularity
*9th-level transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a sliver of meteoric iron, which the spell consumes)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute.

You target a point you can see within range. A 15-foot spherical singularity appears, drawing everything toward it. Each creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the singularity suffers the following effects:
* Its movement speed is reduced to 15 feet.
* The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved 20 feet in a straight line toward the center of the singularity.
* The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and ability checks.
When a creature enters the 15-foot area of the singularity for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 8d6 force damage.
