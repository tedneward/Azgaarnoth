#### Lightning Rod
*5th-level abjuration* (Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you would take lightning damage
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You absorb incoming lightning, taking no damage 
and instead gaining temporary hit points equal to 
the prevented damage until the spell ends. Whenever
you roll lightning damage for a spell you cast, you 
can sacrifice any number of the temporary hit points
granted by this spell and add the same number to 
the damage roll.

As long as you still have any of these temporary 
hit points remaining, your speed increases by 10 feet 
and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws.
