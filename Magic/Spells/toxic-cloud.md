- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a toxic cloud of green gas that lingers over the ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the cloud fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the cloud's space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 poison damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the cloud's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The cloud ends if a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) blows through the area.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
