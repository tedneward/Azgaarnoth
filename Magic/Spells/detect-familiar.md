**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

For the duration, you sense the presence of any creature that is currently serving as a familiar within 30 feet of you. If you sense a familiar in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around the creature. In addition, you are able to sense if its master is within 1 mile of your location and know their general direction.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
