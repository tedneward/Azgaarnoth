___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (150-foot line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pair of tinted glasses)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A powerful beam of light and magical force shoots forth from your hand in a 5-foot wide, 150-foot long line before exploding in a burst of destructive energy. Every creature in the line and within 15 feet of wherever the line ends must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 force damage and 8d6 radiant damage on a failed save, and half damage on a successful save. A creature that failed the Dexterity saving throw must also make a Strength saving throw. A creature is pushed 20 feet on a failed save, and 10 feet on a successful save (away from you in the line, away from the point where the line ends in the explosion).

Huge creatures are pushed half the distance and Gargantuan creatures are not pushed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, both the force damage and radiant damage each increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
