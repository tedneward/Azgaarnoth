You cloak yourself in an aura of might that grants
you strength and speeds your allies' attacks. Until
the end of your next turn, whenever you make an
attack roll, you can roll 1d8 and add the number
rolled to your attack roll. If the attack hits, you add
same number to the damage inflicted. For the same
duration, you gain an additional action on each of
your turns. The action can be used to take any one
of the following actions: Attack (one weapon attack
only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object. Any
creature of your choice that starts
its next turn within 10 feet of you
also gains the same additional
action on its turn.
