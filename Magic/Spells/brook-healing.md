A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 8d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. When healing a creature in this manner, you immediately take psychic damage equal to half the amount healed as psychic damage and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 level of exhaustion.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
