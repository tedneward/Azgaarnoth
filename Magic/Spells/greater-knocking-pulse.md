You send a ï¬‚ow of kinetic energy into the ground, which curves upwards toward a Medium or smaller creature of your choice you can see; the target must be on a surface connected to or in contact with the ground that you are currently on. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 50 feet upwards and must make a DC 15 Dexterity check to avoid falling prone on the landing.If the creature impacts with a surface on the way up before it completes the entire 50 feet, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the impact for every 10 feet that was subtracted from the rising movement, and half damage on a success.You can halve the amount of forced movement to target a Large creature, and reduce it by 3/4 to target a Huge creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you increase the forced movement by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
