Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch
is protected against flying creatures. A creature with
a fly speed has disadvantage on attack rolls against
the subject, and when such a creature causes the
target to make a Dexterity saving throw, it has
advantage on that roll. The target also can't be
charmed or frightened by flying creatures. If the
target is already charmed or frightened by such a
creature, the target has advantage on any new
saving throw against the relevant effect.
