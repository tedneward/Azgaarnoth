# Necrotic Visage
*2nd-level necromancy* (Pale Master, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Up to 10 minutes

You evoke a shadowy visage that appears above you. The visage remains until you use your action to make a melee weapon attack against a target within range. On a successful attack, your attack is replaced by that of the shadowy visage, who hits your target with a necrotic scythe, dealing 4d6 necrotic damage and forcing the target to succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have its movement speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. The visage then disappears.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every slot level above 2nd.
