# Hoodwink
*4th-level illusion* (Artificer, Bard, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You wrap a creature, object, or point you can see within range in an outward-facing illusion. You decide the radius of the sphere of visibility around the target. You may choose any distance between 1 foot and 15 feet. Creatures within the area perceive things as they actually are and do not see or hear the illusion, but creatures outside the area of visibility see and hear the illusion while they remain outside.

The illusion can create sound and can be as large as the area of visibility you chose for the spell You decide what the illusion looks and sounds like, and it stays centered on the target even if the target moves, along with the sphere of visibility. This spell can't create a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature.

The illusion that you create fools the senses of sight and hearing, but it does not fool touch, smell or any other senses. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and the sound it makes becomes faint to them.

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to alter its appearance and sound to continue your charade. The illusion lasts until the spell ends, at which point it vanishes.
