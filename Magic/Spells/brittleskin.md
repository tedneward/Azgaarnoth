___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 50 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shattered crystal)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You make a creature's armor or other outer
covering crystalline and brittle, so that each time the creature is struck, shards of crystal break and
are driven into its skin. Choose one target within
range, which must make a Wisdom saving throw.
On a failure, the target suffers a penalty to its
Armor Class equal to your spellcasting ability
modifier (minimum 1). For the duration, whenever a
target that failed the saving throw against this spell
takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it
takes additional damage of the same type equal to
your spellcasting ability modifier.
