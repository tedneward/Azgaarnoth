You choose a creature you can see within range and
place an invisible mark of shadow upon it. Until the
spell ends, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom
checks to find, notice, or discern information about
you, and you have advantage on Wisdom checks to
find, follow, or discern information about the
target. Once before the spell ends, you can give
yourself advantage on one weapon attack roll
against the spell's current target during your turn.
That attack deals an extra 1d12 psychic damage on a
hit and scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell
ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent
turn of yours to mark a new creature.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can maintain
your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours,
and you add your proficiency bonus to the psychic
damage inflicted.
