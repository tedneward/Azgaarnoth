___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V,S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You surprise an enemy with an unstoppable
telekinetic impact. Choose one creature within
range, which must make a Strength saving throw.
On a failed save, the target takes force damage
equal to 2d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier
and is telekinetically moved 15 feet directly toward
or away from you (your choice). On a successful
save, it takes half as much damage and isn't moved.
You can only move it in a straight line through
space unimpeded by creatures, objects, or obstacles.
You can also move the creature up into the air,
which may cause it to fall.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above
1st. If the spell slot is of 5th level or higher, you may
target one additional creature within range for each
slot level above 4th.
