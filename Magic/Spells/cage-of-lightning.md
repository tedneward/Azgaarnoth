You construct a prison of lightning that appears around one or more creatures you can see within a vertically-oriented 10-foot radius, 20-foot long cylinder. The cylinder can be set on a solid surface with no ﬂoor.The creature(s) is surrounded on all sides by bars made of lightning, with 3-inch spaces between. If a creature is too large to fit into the prison, the spell ends. The prison disappears when the spell ends. The prison remains fixed in space for the duration even if created in midair. The prison does not have a ﬂoor if oriented upon the ground.

If a creature attempts to enter or exit the prison, it must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half damage on a success. In addition, if the creature fails the saving throw, unless resistant or immune to lightning damage, the creature has its speed halved, grants advantage to attacks made against it, and has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the end of its next turn.The prison sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

If cast as a ritual, the spell’s material component is replaced by a tiger’s eye worth at least 50 gp, which is consumed in the casting. The prison becomes permanent until dispelled and no longer requires concentration to maintain if the spell is cast as a ritual. Additional castings of the spell as a ritual can further expand the size of the prison instead of creating new prisons. If cast as a ritual, you can establish a spoken password to enable the prison to form an opening large enough for Large or smaller creatures to enter and exit the prison; the same password closes the opening.
