#### Spirits of Victory
*6th-level conjuration* (Cleric)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You unleash a howling host of warrior spirits who
died before they could defeat their foes, and for the
duration they assault your enemies while helping
you and your allies achieve victory. If you are good
or neutral, their spectral forms resemble angels or
ephemeral constructs (your choice). If you are evil,
they appear to be undead. Until the end of your
next turn, when a creature willingly leaves a space
within 5 feet of you or starts its turn there, it must
make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature takes 4d12 psychic damage and the next
attack roll made against this target before the end
of your next turn has advantage. On a successful
save, a creature takes half as much damage but
suffers no other effects.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above
6th.
