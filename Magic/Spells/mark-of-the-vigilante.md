___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You adopt the persona of a vengeful agent of justice,
taking on a distinctive fighting style
that promises punishment to
those who seek to harm your
allies. For the duration, when
you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can mark
the creature until the end of
your next turn. This effect
ends early if someone else
marks the creature. While it is
within 5 feet of you, a creature
marked by you has
disadvantage on any attack roll
that doesn't target you and cannot
make opportunity attacks against
you.
In addition, until the spell
ends, you can use a bonus
action on each of your
turns to force one
creature within 10 feet
of you to roll a Wisdom
saving throw. It has
advantage on the
saving throw if you
do not currently
have a creature marked,
and it automatically succeeds if it is a construct or
undead. On a failure, a creature takes 1d6 psychic
damage and becomes frightened of you until the
end of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can concentrate
on the spell for up to 8 hours. With a slot that's 5th
level or higher, you can concentrate for up to 24
hours.
