---
Your body transforms entirely into magical ooze for the duration. Choose either acid or poison damage. You gain the following benefits while transformed: 

* You are immune to poison damage and you have resistance to all damage except necrotic damage. 
* You ignore the effects of disease, exhaustion, and poisons. Any poisons or diseases already in your system are suspended, not neutralized.
* You cannot be grappled or restrained 
* You can use a bonus action on your turn to swell or shrink, changing your size to your choice of Small, Medium, Large, or Huge until the spell ends, or to return to your normal size. 
* You can enter other creatures' spaces and stop there, and other creatures treat your space as difficult terrain that costs 4 feet of speed for every 1 foot of movement. You can also move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. At the end of each of your turns, you choose for your slime to be either toxic or caustic, and each other creature within your space must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 acid damage if you chose caustic slime, or it becomes poisoned and blinded until the end of your next turn if you chose toxic slime. 
* When another spell you cast deals damage of the chosen type, it ignores resistance to that damage type, and it deals extra damage of that type equal to 10 + twice the spell's level (18). A spell can't deal this extra damage to any creature more than once per turn.
