You issue a primal cry of victory that creates a 30-foot cone infused with necromantic power harvested from the death of your foe. The area within the cone is difficult terrain for all creatures besides you. Each creature in the cone when you cast this spell must make a Constitution saving throw. Undead, constructs, and creatures immune to necrotic damage automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage, and is vulnerable to necrotic damage for the spell's duration. A hostile creature that starts its turn within the spell's area takes 1d10 necrotic damage.

A creature that failed its saving throw can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it is no longer suffers the vulnerability to necrotic damage conferred by this spell.

In addition, for the spell's duration, the first time you hit a creature in the spell's area with a melee attack on each of your turns, that attack deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.

The sound of the initial warcry you make when you cast this spell can be heard up to 100 feet away.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels
