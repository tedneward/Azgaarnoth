#### Rainbow Beam
*2nd-level evocation* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A ray of rainbow colored light streaks from your hand. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes damage equal to 2d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and it is stunned until the end of its next turn. A successful Constitution saving throw negates the stunning effect.

The type of damage dealt is rolled randomly from the following table:

d8 | Color | Damage Type
-- | ----- | -----------
1 | Red | Fire
2 | Orange | Acid
3 | Yellow | Lightning
4 | Green | Poison
5 | Blue | Cold
6 | Indigo | Thunder
7 | Violet | Force
8 | Multihued | Roll again twice, ignoring this result if rolled again

If the result indicates the beam is multihued, then the target takes 2d12 points of damage for each of the two damage types.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the amount of damage of the type rolled increases by 1d12 for every two slot levels above 2nd.
