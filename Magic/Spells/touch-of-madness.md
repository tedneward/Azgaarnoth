---
Maddening whispers and babbling nonsense rush into the mind of a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d4 psychic damage, and the creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
This spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
