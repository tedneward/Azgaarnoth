You let out a discordant, piercing scream that is painful to all nearby creatures. Each creature within 15 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d6 thunder damage, and is knocked prone. It takes half as much damage on a successful save, and is not knocked prone. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. The sound of this spell can be heard up to 150 feet away (or farther with a successful Wisdom (Perception) check as determined by your DM). 

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every slot level above 3rd.
