#### Battlesheath of Lightning
*1st-level evocation* (Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Tendrils of lightning sheathe your hand but do not shock you. If you are wielding a weapon in the sheathed hand, the lightning sheathes the weapon as well if you so desire. If you make a melee attack against a creature or object with the lightning-sheathed hand/weapon, you deal an additional 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. When you deal the lightning damage, the lightning is dispersed immediately afterwards, but you can re-sheathe your hand (and weapon) with a bonus action.

The sheathed hand/weapon emits bright light in a 10-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you increase the damage by 1d6 for every two slot levels higher than 1st.
