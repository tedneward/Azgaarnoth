You focus you mind and body on the relentless
pursuit of your foe. Choose a creature you can see
within range. Until this spell ends, you gain the
following benefits whenever you can see the target:
* Your speed increases by 15 feet.
* Your movement does not provoke opportunity
attacks.
* When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you
deal an extra 1d6 psychic damage. This damage
is increased to 1d12 if the creature is the target of
this spell.
* When you hit the target of this spell with a
weapon attack, you can mark that creature until
the end of your next turn. While it is within 5
feet of you, a creature marked by you has
disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't
target you.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, you can concentrate
on the spell for up to 8 hours. With a slot that's 7th
level or higher, you can concentrate for up to 24
hours.
