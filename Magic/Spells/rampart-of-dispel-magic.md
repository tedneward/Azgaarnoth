You create a pulsating wall of magical energy that purges magical effects from any creature that passes through it. The wall is a line that can be up to 40 feet in length, 40 feet high, and 5 feet thick. When you cast this spell, you cannot place it in any occupied space, and it must be placed in a space that you can see. The wall is visible to all creatures with an Intelligence score higher than 11. A creature that passes through the wall has any spell of 6th level or lower on it end. Spells of 7th level or higher on the target are unaffected.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 1 hour. If you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use an 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts for 1 month. Using a spell slot of 7th level or higher grants a duration that does not require Concentration.
