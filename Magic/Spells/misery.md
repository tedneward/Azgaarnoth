You extend your hand and touch a creature while muttering a tribulation under your breath; one that dwells in a plane of anguish. Upon casting this spell, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 necrotic damage and have its soul become tainted. You regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.

Until the spell ends, if the target is within 30 feet of you at the start of your turns, using your action, you can force it to succeed on a Constitution saving throw take 1d6 necrotic damage. A creature of your choosing within 5 feet of the target regains hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. A successful saving throw ends the spell. 

***At Higher Levels.***When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 on each instance of damage for every three spell slot levels above 1st.
