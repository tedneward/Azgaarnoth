# Blood Quill
*2nd-level divination (ritual)* (Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a quill made from the feather of an exotic monstrosity worth at least 100 gp)

**Duration:** 1 day

You can attempt to learn a wizard spell from a spellcaster within 24 hours of his or her death. You pierce the corpse with the specially prepared quill and as it siphons the blood from the cadaver, select one wizard spell prepared or known to the deceased spellcaster.

The spell must be of a level for which you have a spell slot and you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to determine whether the quill absorbs it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell ends and consumes the quill.

Once the quill absorbs the spell, you may take the time to transcribe it into your spellbook using the normal rules for copying a spell. The quill crumbles into dust at the end of the duration or once you copy the absorbed spell into a spellbook, whichever happens first.
