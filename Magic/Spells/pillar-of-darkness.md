A brightly glowing image of two rotating circles of glyphs appears, then a vertical column of pitch-black darkness erupts from one circle to the other. Each creature in a 10-ft. radius, 40-foot cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 9d8 necrotic damage and is necrotized until the end of your next turn on a failed save. A creature takes half damage on a successful save. A creature that is killed by this spell can not be resurrected for 24 hours, and it corpse takes half as long to turn into an undead.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.
