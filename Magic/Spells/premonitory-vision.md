#### Premonitory Vision
*4th-level divination* *(ritual)* (Bard,Druid,Ranger,Sorcerer)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you finish a short or long rest
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You perceive a series of images that show you future
events. You ask a single question concerning a
specific goal, event, or activity to occur within seven
days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply
might be a short phrase, an explanation of your own
emotional reaction, or a description of a single
image you saw.
The spell doesn't consider any possible
circumstances that might change the outcome, such
as the casting of additional spells, or the loss or gain
of a companion.
After you cast this spell, unless you treat yourself
with a special calming tincture that uses 25 gold
pieces worth of ingredients, you have disadvantage
on Wisdom, Dexterity, and Intelligence checks, and
on Constitution saving throws to maintain
concentration for 10 minutes.
If you cast the spell two or more times before
finishing your next long rest, you receive
increasingly confusing visions that muddle your
mind. For each casting after the first, the duration
of the negative effects for not imbibing a calming
tincture increase by an additional (cumulative) 10
minutes, and there is a cumulative 25* chance that
the information you perceive is random and
possibly unrelated to the question you asked. The
DM makes this roll in secret.
