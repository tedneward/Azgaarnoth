You are surrounded by a swirling shield of protective green acid that doesn't damage you or your equipment. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits:

* You have resistance to acid damage.
* You can't be restrained by nonmagical objects.
* Any creature that grapples you or begins its turn while grappling you takes 12d4 acid damage.
* Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you makes a melee attack against you, the creature has disadvantage on the attack, and it takes 8d4 acid damage before the attack hits or misses.
* When you are attacked with a weapon, the attack misses and the swirling acid consumes the weapon, dissolving it and destroying it. If ammunition was used, it is consumed instead. This doesn't happen if the weapon is magical or a natural weapon, or if the attack used magical ammunition.

A creature killed by this spell is dissolved into slime.
