---
You project a ray of shimmering force at a single
opponent when you cast this spell, allowing you to
bring them down without causing lasting harm.
Make a ranged spell attack. On hit, the target takes
5d4 force damage. If this damage reduces a creature
to 0 hit points, you can choose to knock the
creature unconscious instead of killing it. This
choice must be made as damage is assigned if the
creature drops to 0 hit points. An unconscious
creature is stabilized at 0 hit points, as if by the
spare the dying  cantrip.
At Higher Levels.  The damage increases by 1d4
for each slot level above 2nd.
