Your eyes glow white, forcing anyone who meets your gaze to relive their worst memories. For the duration of the spell, you may choose one target per turn and force them to make a Wisdom save to withstand meeting your terrible gaze. You may effect a number of targets equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. If your target fails their save, they are trapped in this nightmare vision and are blinded for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. Victims may make Wisdom save every turn to end the condition. Once someone makes a successful save they become immune to this spell for 24 hours.
