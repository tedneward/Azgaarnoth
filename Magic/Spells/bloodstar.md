#### Bloodstar
*4th-level conjuration* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a ruby worth at least 50 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You create a pulsating ruby-red orb that shoots from your hand to a point you choose within range. The orb hovers at its destination, shedding dim light in a 20-foot radius.

You choose any number of creatures within 10 feet of the orb. When a creature you chose takes damage while within 10 feet of the orb, it must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it suffers disadvantage on all Constitution checks and saving throws until the spell ends.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can move the bloodstar up to 30 feet and choose new targets. When you do so, creatures who have previously failed their Constitution saving throw against the orb's effects can make another Constitution saving throw if they are not within 10 feet of the orb's new location, ending the effects on themselves with a success. The orb itself is made only of light, and cannot take damage or be attacked.
