___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You channel divine energies to construct a glowing missile of radiance that hovers above your hand before you throw it. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see. On a hit, the target takes 9d8 radiant damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is stunned until the start of your next turn.

If the attack misses, the missile immediately returns to your space and moves with you, hovering within a few feet of your location. You can use an action to make another ranged spell attack with the missile. The missile will keep returning to you until it hits a target. The spell ends when the missile hits a target or 1 minute has passed, at which point the missile disappears.

If the target is an undead or a fiend, the missile deals 11d8 radiant damage instead, and the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.
