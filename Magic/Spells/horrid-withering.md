#### Horrid Withering
*8th-level necromancy* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sponge)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You select a point that you can see within range,
and a burst of necrotic energy evaporates moisture
within a 60-foot radius from the point you selected.
A creature caught within the area when the spell is
cast must make a Constitution saving throw. A
creature takes 13d6 necrotic damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If
the damage from this spell drops a creature to 0 Hit
Points, it dies, and its body shrivels up, leaving only
dry bones.
