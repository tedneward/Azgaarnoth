#### Sleep of Horror
*3rd-level necromancy* *(ritual)* (Bard,Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of black sand)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A target you choose within range must make an
Intelligence saving throw. If it fails the save, its next
sleep is wracked with terrifying nightmares, and
does not gain any of the benefits of a long rest. After
that, every time it finishes a long rest, it must make
the Intelligence saving throw again. If it fails, it
gains no benefit from the long rest. If it succeeds,
the spell ends. The spell continues until the target
makes its Intelligence saving throw, or until it dies.
