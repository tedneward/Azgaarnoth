# Alamanther's Return
*9th-level transmutation* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you are targeted by a spell of 8th-level or lower or included in such a spellâ€™s area of effect

**Range**: Special

**Components**: V, S, M (a silver mirror worth at least 1,000 gp)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You duplicate the spell of another spellcaster that targets you or includes you in its area of effect. The spell must be 8th level or lower and have a casting time of 1 action. As part of the casting this spell, you immediately cast the triggering spell as well, changing the casting time of the duplicated spell to 1 reaction. The spell is cast using the same level spell slot as the triggering spell, and any metamagic options applied to the triggering spell are applied to your spell as well. The new spell originates from you, and any required rolls for the second casting (such as spell attack rolls, damage rolls, ability checks, or saving throws) are made separately to the original triggering spell.
