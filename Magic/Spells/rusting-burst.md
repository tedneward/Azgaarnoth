# Rusting Burst
*4th-level transmutation* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (20-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of rust monster chitin)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You generate a burst of corrosive energy in an area around you that rusts ferrous metal objects. All nonmagical ferrous metal (iron, steel, and alloys) that is not being worn or carried, crumbles to useless dust.

Any creatures wearing or carrying such objects must make a Dexterity saving throw or have their metal objects crumble to dust before their very eyes. If the saving throw fails by 4 or less, the objects are weakened, losing integrity and becoming brittle. Weakened weapons are reduced to the next lower dice for damage rolls (a longsword deals 1d6 instead of 1d8, a dagger deals 1d3 instead of 1d4), and armor suffers a -2 penalty to its AC. Other objects suffer reduced function or may fail on use (i.e. iron pitons cannot hold weight, pots leak, etc) with the exact effect left up to the DM. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the object is destroyed.
