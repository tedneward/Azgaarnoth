- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
---
You create a set of connected stairs made of solid, translucent magical force leading up a direction of your choice, and starting from a space within 10 feet. The stairs may be diagonal or spiral upwards. The maximum height that you can place the top of the stairs is 60 feet. The stairs can be made wide enough to accommodate Large or smaller creatures. The stairs are fixed in space and do not need to connect with another structure to maintain their integrity. They can support any amount of weight while they exist.The stairs are immune to all damage and canâ€™t be dispelled by [dispel magic](./dispel-magic.md). A [disintegrate](./disintegrate.md) spell destroys the stairs instantly, however. The stairs also extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the stairs.

When the spell ends or is dismissed, the stairs disappear and anything on them falls.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a slot of 6th level or higher, you increase the maximum height by 10 feet for each slot level higher than 5th.
