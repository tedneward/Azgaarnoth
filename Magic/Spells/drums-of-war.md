The sounds of ominous drums fill the air, preparing
your allies for war and filling your enemies with
dread. Allies within the area of effect gain +4 to hit
in melee. Enemies within range must make a
Wisdom saving throw. Those that fail have -2 to hit
rolls, and make Wisdom saving throws with
disadvantage. Enemies may repeat the Wisdom save
at the end of their turn to end the spell's effect on
them.
