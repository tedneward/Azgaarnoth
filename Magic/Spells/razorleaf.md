#### Razorleaf
*Transmutation cantrip* (Druid)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 120 feet 
- **Components:** S 
- **Duration:** Instantaneous 
---
You hurl a leaf or blade of grass that you are holding at a creature or object within range as your magic aids its flight. If you are not holding a leaf or blade of grass, one is magically plucked from a random non-creature plant within 60 feet of you and flies to the target. If there are no leaves or blades of grass within 60 feet of you, the spell fails.

Make a spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 damage. The damage type is determÂ­ined by the projectile. If you used a needle (such as from a pine tree), the spell deals piercing damage. Otherwise it deals slashing damage. If you were not holding the projectile, the attack determines cover and line of effect as if it was made from the projectile's original location instead of your location. 

The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
