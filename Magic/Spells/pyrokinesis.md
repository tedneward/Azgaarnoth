- **Range:** 30 ft
- **Components:** M (brimstone or a flame)
- **Duration:** Concentration, 1 Minute
---
With a thought, you cause one creature that you can see within range to spontaneously combust. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target ignites in flames, taking 1d10 fire damage and burning for the duration.

At the start of each of its turns while it is burning, the target must repeat the Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 fire damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.

You can choose to target an object that you can see within range which isn't being worn or carried instead of targeting a creature. If you do, the object automatically fails its saving throws, and it doesn't stop burning when the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage dealt increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
