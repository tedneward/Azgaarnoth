When you hit with a melee attack, you can decide
to take half of the attack's total damage yourself
(rounded down). When you do so, your attack deals
maximum damage to your target, including
maximum damage from additional dice added to
the attack's damage, such as dice from a critical hit
or magical enhancement.
