You place a divinely empowered curse on a creature
that you can see within range. For the duration,
whenever the target is within the reach of your
melee weapon, it provokes an opportunity attack
from you whenever it makes an attack roll that does
not target you. In addition, at the end of each of its
turns, it takes 1d6 radiant damage if it hit a creature
other than you with an attack roll.
If the target drops to 0 hit points before the spell
ends, you can use a bonus action on your turn to
move the spell's effect to a new creature within
range.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain
your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours.
When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you
can maintain your concentration on the spell for up
to 24 hours.
