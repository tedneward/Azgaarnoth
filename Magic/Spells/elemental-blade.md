When you cast this spell, a blade of elemental energy appears in the hand of a willing creature you touch. You choose one of the following damage types when you cast this spell: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. The elemental blade is the size and shape of a normal shortsword, but is virtually weightless. If the wielder lets go of the blade, it disappears, but until the spell ends, you can evoke it for the creature again as a bonus action.

The blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and the wielder can use its action to make a melee attack with the blade, rolling the attack as if it were attacking with a regular shortsword. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier damage of the type chosen when this spell was first cast. Since the blade is immaterial, the wielder's Strength or Dexterity modifiers do not apply to the damage, nor does any extra damage from special abilities the wielder may possess (such as sneak attack).

A creature who takes damage from this spell suffers an additional effect depending on the type of damage inflicted, as follows:

* **Acid.** The creature suffers disadvantage on the next Constitution saving throw it makes before the start of its next turn (this includes a saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell which may be caused by this spell's damage).
* **Cold.** Until the end of the creature's next turn, its speed is reduced by half and it cannot take reactions.
* **Fire.** The creature must immediately choose to either fall prone to extinguish flames on its body or be ignited, taking 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns until it or another creature within 5 feet takes an action to extinguish the flames. Creatures wearing metal armor are immune to this effect.
* **Lightning.** The creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and it takes an extra 1d4 lightning damage if it is wearing metal armor.
* Poison. The creature is poisoned until the end of its next turn.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a 4th level or higher spell slot, the damage on a hit increases by ld4 for every two slot levels above 2nd.
