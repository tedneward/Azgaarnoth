A thin red line stretches from your palm, which you
wield as a whip. The whip counts as a magical
weapon with a reach of 10 feet, with which you are
considered proficient. As part of the action of
casting this spell, and again as an action on each of
your turns for the spell's duration, you can make a
melee spell attack. Any target struck takes 3d6
psychic damage, and must make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the victim has
disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until
the end of its next turn due to the intense pain.
