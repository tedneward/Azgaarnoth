You twist and warp stone. If this spell is cast on a
stone door, or a door in a stone frame, the door
opens and cannot be closed. If the target is a stone
wall, the next attack to that section of the wall will
deal double damage. If the target is a stone statue,
the statue becomes a leering grotesque.
