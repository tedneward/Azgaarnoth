As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects.

This spell allows the caster to use a melee weapon and make a single melee weapon attack against any target within spell range that the caster can see. Despite the distance, the damage being inflicted is still considered to have come from a melee attack delivered by the caster using the weapon in the spell casting with all applicable bonuses, modifiers, and penalties that would be used under normal 5-foot range melee attack circumstances.
