___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of sweat)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You strike a creature you can see within range with an enervating black ray. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer two levels of [exhaustion](../../Conditions/Exhaustion.md). If the creature misses its saving throw by 5 or more, it suffers four levels of exhaustion (but cannot take a creature to exhaustion level 6, that is, death). On a successful save, the creature suffers only one level of exhaustion.

Levels of exhaustion inflicted by this spell can only be recovered normally (through multiple long rests).
