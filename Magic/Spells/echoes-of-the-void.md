# Echoes of the Void
*5th-level conjuration* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 150 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a pickled octopus tentacle)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure the merest shadow of the void in a 60-foot radius centered on a point within range. This frigid, inky blackness torments those within. The area is considered difficult terrain and is utterly black, and creatures within the area of darkness have the blinded condition unless they have senses beyond sight. Any creature in the area of effect must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage. At the start of each of its turns, any creature in the area of darkness takes 2d6 cold damage.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.

Any caster who does not have at least one level of [Voidmancy](/Classes/Wizard/Voidmancy.md) must make a Wisdom save against DC 15, or take 2d6 psychic damage when they cast this spell.
