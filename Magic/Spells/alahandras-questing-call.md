This spell shows you shadowy images of any adventurers that are currently taking a short or long rest. 

At the beginning of your turn you will see one resting adventurer within range. You have no control over which adventurer you are shown. You can see a 60-foot radius around the adventurer within the limitations of your own vision, but the spell does not tell you their exact location. You can communicate telepathically with the resting adventurer, but you can send no more than 25 words.

This spell is notoriously fickle, 30% of the time it shows the caster random images from other planes.
