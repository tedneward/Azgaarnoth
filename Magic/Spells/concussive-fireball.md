A bright streak ﬂashes from your pointed finger, blossoming with a loud roar into a battering explosion of ﬂames. The explosion affects creatures and objects in a 25-foot radius sphere area centered upon a point you can see. Every creature in the affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 fire damage and 3d4 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, and takes half damage on a successful save. A Large or smaller creature is within the affected area must also make a Strength saving throw. A creature is pushed 15 feet from the center and falls prone on a failed save, and is pushed 5 feet from the center on a successful save.

The fire ignites ﬂammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d6 and the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 5th.
