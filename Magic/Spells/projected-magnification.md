#### Projected Magnification
*2nd-level illusion* *(ritual)* (Bard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 1 mile
- **Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Choose a 5 foot square within the range. That
square is recreated within 10 feet of you. The image
is purely visual, with no sound of smell. The image
is an obvious illusion, and creatures can see through
it. The spell creates a snapshot of the 5 foot area you
chose when you cast the spell, but nothing in the
area moves or changes. The area appears exactly as
it does at the time of the spell, and you do gain any
special means of vision. For instance, if the area is
covered in darkness, either natural or magical, then
so is the snapshot.
