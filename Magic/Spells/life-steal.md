- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You pull pure life force out of your victim. The
target must immediately make a Wisdom saving
throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6d6
necrotic damage, or half as much on a success.
Whether the target succeeds or fails its saving
throw, you are healed by the amount of damage
dealt. Alternatively, you can transfer these hit
points to an ally that you touch when you cast the
spell.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the necrotic
damage dealt increases by 1d6 for every slot level
above 5th.
