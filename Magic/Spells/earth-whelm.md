You use primal magic to confuse the elements in a 150-foot cube centered on a point that you can see within range. Ground in the area becomes fluid without losing its shape. This effect extends through total cover, below the ground's surface. Each creature and object on the ground in the area sinks partially into the ground, as if the ground were a liquid.

Ground in the area must be traversed as if it were a water-like liquid--walking or burrowing normally is impossible. The ground is heavily obscured and difficult terrain. A creature that is entirely submerged in it must hold its breath or suffocate, and any creature that ends its turn while touching it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature is pulled 20 feet downward, below the ground's surface. 

Each structure touching the ground in the area sinks 5 feet into the ground at the start of each of your turns for the duration. The ground flows around corners and into open structures, affecting the creatures inside, but it can't flow through total cover. 

When the spell ends, either because your concentÂ­ration is broken or because you decide to end it, ground in the area returns to its normal state. Each creature that is entirely immersed in ground becomes trapped Until it is excavated or it manages some way out on its own, it is [buried](../Conditions/Buried.md). 

This spell only affects ground composed primarily of some form of earth, such as dirt, sand, clay, crystal, ash, metal, etc. It does not affect other materials like bone, wood, ice, etc.
