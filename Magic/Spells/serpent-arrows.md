___

- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a serpent scale)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
You touch a quiver containing arrows or bolts.
When a target is hit by a ranged weapon attack using a piece of ammunition drawn from the quiver,
the target takes an extra 2d6 poison damage. Even if
the attack misses, the target takes 1d6 poison
damage. The spell's magic ends on the piece of
ammunition when it hits or misses, and the spell
ends when ten pieces of ammunition have been
drawn from the quiver.
After each attack, whether it hits or misses, the
used piece of ammunition falls into an unoccupied
space closest to the target, where it transforms into
a giant poisonous snake  under the control of the
creature who attacked with the ammunition.
Giant poisonous snakes  created by this spell
are friendly to you and your companions. They act
on the initiative of the creature who attacked with
the ammunition, immediately after that creature's
turn ends, but act on their own. The snakes obey
any verbal commands issued by the creature
controlling them (no action required by you). If that
creature doesn't issue any commands, the snakes
continue to attack the target of the ranged attack
(even if the target has dropped to 0 hit points), but
otherwise take no actions beyond defending
themselves.
Each snake changes back into a piece of
ammunition when it drops to 0 hit points or when
the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of
pieces of ammunition you can affect increases by
two for each slot level above 4th.
