You choose two willing creatures within an
Intelligence of 6 or higher and link their life forces.
Any damage taken by either creature targeted by
this spell is split between the linked creatures. If a
spell that inflicts half damage on a successful saving
throw strikes both creatures, they make only one
saving throw (they choose which creature will make
the save) and then split any damage inflicted
between them per this spell's normal effect.
