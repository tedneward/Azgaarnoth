- **Casting Time:** 1 minute

- **Duration:** 8 hours

You call upon the dark of deepest midnight to cover the land, affecting the entire area within range of you. For the duration, nonmagical light can't enter the area, and nonmagical light within the area is suppressed, leaving the area in nonmagical darkness except for sources of magical light, which only reach to half of their normal radiuses within the area. 

The area extends through total cover, but twenty feet of rock or metal or one foot of lead will block it. 

In addition, you and up to six other creatures of your choice that you can see when you cast the spell have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet while within the spell's area until the spell ends. 

Casting this spell every day in the same place for a month causes it to take root permanently.
