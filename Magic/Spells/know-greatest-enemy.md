Your eyes flash green, turning golden as you survey your opponents and perceive a shimmering green aura over the most powerful foe. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. You instantly know which creature has the highest challenge rating. If multiple opponents are tied for the highest challenge rating, you become aware that all of them are equally as powerful. This spell does not tell you the actual challenge rating of any creature, just which of the creatures is most powerful. 

The spell confers no other information.
