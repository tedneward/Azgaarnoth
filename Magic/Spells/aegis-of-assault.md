#### Aegis of Assault
*3rd-level conjuration* (Paladin,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a creature within range succeeds on a melee attack roll that would hit one of your allies
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
With a flash of light, you bring instant vengeance to
the attacking enemy. As part of the reaction used to
cast this spell, you choose to do either one or both
of the following:
* Teleport to an unoccupied space, as long as that
space is not farther away than you are now from
the creature that made the triggering attack.
* Make one melee weapon attack against the
attacker if it is within reach. You can use your
spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the
attack and damage rolls of this attack if you
choose. If that attack hits, it deals an extra 1d4
radiant damage.
If you are unable to do either one, the spell ends.
Otherwise, after the triggering attack is resolved,
you mark the creature who made that attack until
the end of your next turn. While it is within 5 feet of
you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you. This spell
ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if
someone else marks the creature.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range increases
to 60 feet, and the extra radiant damage inflicted
with the melee weapon attack increases by 1d4 for
each slot level above 3rd.
