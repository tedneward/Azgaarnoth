You point toward a creature you can see within range, and your arm briefly becomes a long, venomous plant or animal to strike it. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 piercing damage, it is poisoned until the spell ends, and you can choose to pull it up to 10 feet closer to you.

While a creature is poisoned by this spelL its speed is halved and it takes 3d8 poison damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, it makes a Constitution saving throw, ending the spell on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the piercing damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
