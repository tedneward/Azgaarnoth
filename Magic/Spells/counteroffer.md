*3rd-level enchantment* (Bard, Cleric, Warlock)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you make an attack roll.
- **Range:** 60ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gold coin)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
You attempt to finesse a creature making an attack into accepting a regrettable deal. Choose a creature making an attack roll; the creature must succeed a Wisdom saving throw determined by the quality of the deal offered. The DC = 8 + your spell casting modifier + the slot level expended to cast this spell.

On a failure the creature is forced to accept the deal, gaining 10 temporary hit points, until your next turn, in exchange for attacking a different target you choose within its attacks range. If the creature is reduced to 0hp within a minute, you regain hit points equal to twice your spellcasting modifier.
