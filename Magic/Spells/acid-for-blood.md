As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a melee attack with a weapon against
one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the
spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's
normal effects and takes an extra 3d6 force damage
from the hit. On a miss, the spell ends.
If the initial attack hits, at the end of each of the
target's turns before the spell ends, the target must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 5d8 acid
damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the acid damage
increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 5th.
