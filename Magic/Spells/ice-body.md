___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour
---
You change yourself into a being of magical ice. 
You keep your general size and shape and retain all 
your abilities, but equipment that you are wearing 
melds into your body and ceases to function for the 
duration.

While under the effects of this spell, you have 
vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to cold and 
poison damage; and resistance to bludgeoning, 
piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical 
weapons. Additionally, whenever a creature hits you 
with a melee attack or ends its turn in direct 
contact with you (such as through a grapple), that 
creature takes 1d6 cold damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th or 7th level, the duration increases 
to 8 hours. When you cast this spell using a spell slot
of 8th or 9th level, the duration increases to 24 
hours.
