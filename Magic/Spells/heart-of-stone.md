___
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour

- **Duration:** 1 year

When this spell is cast, your heart is replaced with an ornately crafted stone heart. For the spell's duration, your living heart is stored in a special alchemical solution at a hidden location, which you have either prepared and chosen previously, or which you choose during the casting of this spell from among locations you have been to in the last 24 hours.

The stone heart grants you resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage, as well as resistance to damage from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing weapons.

However, the stone heart also has the following disadvantages:  

* You can only gain a maximum of 1 hit point per hit die when you heal naturally.
* You instantly die if your living heart is damaged or destroyed.
* A creature that can see the location of your heart or is close enough to hear it beating can find it, but only if they are actively searching for it.

The DC for ability checks to find your heart is equal to your spellcasting DC.

In addition, the heart of stone can be dispelled, which transfers your living heart back to your body, and sends your stone heart to your living heart's previous hiding place. If you enter an anti-magic field, your stone heart and living heart temporarily switch places, and then switch back again after you leave the affected area.
