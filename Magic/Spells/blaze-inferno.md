Searing ﬂames gather and swirl in a 60-foot radius, 60-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. Every creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 40d6 fire damage, and must make a Constitution saving throw (unless the creature is resistant or immune to fire damage). A creature takes half damage on a successful Dexterity save. A creature gains one level of exhaustion on a failed Constitution save and is considered [ablaze](../../Conditions/Ablaze.md).

The fire spreads around corners. The spell damages objects in the area and ignites ﬂammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.
