You clutch your hand into a fist, and a hand of invisible force grips the throat of one creature you can see within range. The target takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the spell ends. 

While restrained, the target takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns, and it can't speak or breathe. If it must breathe to survive, it has disadvantage on saving throws made for concentration, and you add your spellcasting ability modifier to the DC of those saving throws caused by the spell's damage.

The target can use an action on its turn to make a Strength saving throw against the spelL escaping the effect on a successful saving throw. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other.
