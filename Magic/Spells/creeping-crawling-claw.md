# Creeping Crawling Claw
*1st-level necromancy* (ritual) (Pale Master, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (severed hand of a creature)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Choose the hand of a creature that has been severed from its body for longer than 24 hours and grant it sentience. For the duration of the spell, the [crawling claw](/Creatures/Crawling-Claw.md) is under your control and can be commanded using your bonus action. The claw can only understand simple commands.

The claw is under your control for 1 hour, after which it stops obeying you. To reassert control for another hour or to assert control over an existing crawling claw, you may cast this spell again.

If the claw is still alive when the spell ends, it will attempt seek to reunite itself with its rightful owner. If its original owner is dead, the claw will wander off purposelessly.
