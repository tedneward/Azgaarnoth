#### Iron Scarf
*1st-level transmutation* (Artificer,Bard,Ranger,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a silk scarf)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You seize a silk scarf and lash it towards your enemy, causing it to magically extend and becomes as hard as iron on impact. Make a melee spell attack against a target you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage, and is restrained until the end of your next turn by the scarf, which wraps around it like a constricting snake.

A creature restrained by the scarf can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. As soon as the scarf is no longer restraining a target, it snaps back onto your person and resumes its normal size, and the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a 2nd level or higher spell slot, the damage increases by ld6 for each slot level above 1st. If the spell slot is 5th level or higher, the range increases to 60 feet.
