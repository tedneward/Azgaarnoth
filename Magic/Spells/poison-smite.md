___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
The next time you hit a creature with a weapon
attack before the spell ends, your weapon inflicts an
extra 1d6 poison damage, and the target must make
a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature is poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can
make a new saving throw at the end of each of its
turns to end the poisoned condition early. On a
successful save, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial poison
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
1st.
