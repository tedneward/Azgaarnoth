You unleash a vortex of powerful freezing winds that swirl in a 80-foot high, 30-foot-radius cylinder centered at a point on the ground you within range. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to move the vortex up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The vortex sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren’t secured to anything and that aren’t worn or carried by anyone. A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw and a Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the vortex or that the vortex enters its space, including when the vortex first appears. A creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed Dexterity save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed Constitution save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that starts its turn in the vortex must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A Large or smaller creature that fails the Dexterity save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the vortex until the spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the vortex, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the vortex and falls when the spell ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the vortex and is hurled 4d6 × 10 feet away from it in a random direction.

Nonmagical fires in the affected area are extinguished and unattended liquids are frozen. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.
