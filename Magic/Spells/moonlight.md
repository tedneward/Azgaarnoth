You are surrounded by a silvery sphere of moonlight. 

While the spell lasts, you are heavily obscured, your space is filled with bright light, and you have resistance to radiant damage. You also shed dim light in a 60-foot radius which dampens any bright light that it touches, reducing that bright light to dim light. 

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. 

When an affected creature enters the dim light for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 6d6 radiant damage and suffers disadvantage on any attack rolls it makes before the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, it takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects. 

A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvÂ­antage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.

Light created by this spell is moonlight.
