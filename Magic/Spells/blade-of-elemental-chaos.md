#### Blade of Elemental Chaos
*2nd-level evocation* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a multi-colored leaf)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You evoke a blade of unstable elemental energy in your free hand that you are able to hold without being harmed. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action. When you cast this spell, roll 1d6. The result determines the initial damage type and nature of the elemental blade: 

1. Acid (corrosive liquid)
2. Cold (frigid air)
3. Fire (burning ﬂame)
4. Lightning (crackling lightning)
5. Thunder (distorted air)
6. Bludgeoning (ﬂoating stones)

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 damage of the type rolled for the blade. When you end your turn, roll again for the blade’s damage type. If the result is different, the blade’s damage type changes to the new result.

If the blade’s damage type is fire or lightning, it sheds bright light in a 20-ft. radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 2nd.
