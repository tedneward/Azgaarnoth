#### Blackfire
*8th-level necromancy* (Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust from an immolated vampire)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You exhale black flame toward a creature of your
choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On
a hit, your target is engulfed in numbing black
flame and becomes poisoned for the duration. Until
the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Each
time it fails, it takes 1 level of exhaustion. If the
target makes three successful Constitution saves,
the fire goes out and the spell ends.
While the spell is still active, at the start of each
of the target's turns, anyone within 5 feet of it must
make a successful Dexterity saving throw. On a
failure, it suffers the same effects as the target,
becoming poisoned by engulfing blackfire.
Anyone killed by the blackfire spell is
disintegrated (as if by the disintegrate  spell). A
disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing
and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a
pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored
to life only by means of a true resurrection  or a wish
spell.
