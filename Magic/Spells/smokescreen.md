You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It can't be dispersed by wind, but truesight, blindsight, or a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against the caster's spell save DC as an action enables a creature to ignore the effects of the fog.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.
