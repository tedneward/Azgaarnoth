---
You attempt to boil the blood of one creature that you can see within range. If the body of the target has blood, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is poisoned and takes 2d6 fire damage as its blood begins to heat to a boil.

A creature poisoned by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 fire damage. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it takes 2d6 damage at the end of each of its turns for the duration. The successes and failure do not need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature and the damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 4th.
