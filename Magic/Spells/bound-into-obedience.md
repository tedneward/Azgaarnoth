# Bound into Obedience
*6th-level enchantment* (Bard, Pale Master, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (Black sapphire dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 10 days

You touch a creature that is unconscious and cause ethereal chains to bind the creature's hands. If the target regains consciousness, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at disadvantage or become charmed by you for the duration.

While bound into your servitude in this manner, the target must obey your verbal commands to the best of its ability as your servant. The target will not willingly hurt itself. If you command the target to perform an action strongly opposed by its core values, or you or your companions take an action harmful to it, your DM might allow the creature to make another Wisdom saving throw to break its shackles and end this effect.

When the spell ends, the creature is no longer bound to you as a servant and has full knowledge of the tasks you made it perform. A [Remove Curse](/Magic/Spells/remove-curse.md), [Greater Restoration](/Magic/Spells/greater-restoration.md), or [Wish](/Magic/Spells/wish.md) spell also ends it.
