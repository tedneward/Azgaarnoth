- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You set off a fiery explosion centered on yourself. 
Each creature in the area other than yourself must 
make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a 
creature takes 5d8 fire damage, is pushed 10 feet 
away from you, and is knocked prone. On a 
successful save, a creature takes half as much 
damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone.

The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that 
aren't being worn or carried. In addition, unsecured 
objects that are completely within the area of effect 
are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by 
the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous 
boom audible out to 300 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases
by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
