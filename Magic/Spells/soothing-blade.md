___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 minute
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects.

When this spell is cast, the weapon is imbued with healing powers. The spell does require an initial weapon attack on a hostile target as part of the casting, but this initial attack need not succeed to have the spell take effect for the duration. On each successful weapon attack on a hostile target, the caster is healed for 1 HP. 

Once cast, subsequent rounds do not require additional castings for as long as the spell duration lasts. Additional castings are wasted while the duration is in effect and will neither improve nor extend the healing afforded from the first casting.

***At Higher Levels.*** The healing improves by an additional 1 HP for each spell level above 1st-level.
