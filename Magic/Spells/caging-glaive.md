Both your hands must be empty when you cast this
spell, which causes an otherworldly polearm made
of smoldering green iron to appear in your two free
hands. This magic polearm lasts until the spell ends.
It counts as a martial melee weapon with which you
are proficient, and you can use your spellcasting
ability instead of Strength for the attack and
damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon. It
deals 4d10 necrotic damage on hit and has the
heavy, reach, and two-handed properties.
In addition, when you hit a creature with the
polearm, the target's speed is reduced by half, you
pull it 5 feet closer to you, and all melee attacks
against the target are made with advantage until it
starts its turn further than 5 feet away from you.
If you drop the weapon, it dissipates at the end of
the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you
can use a bonus action to cause the polearm to
reappear in your hand.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage
increases to 5d10.
