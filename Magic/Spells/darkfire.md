Dark blue fire surrounds your body and encircles
the ground on which you stand. As part of the
action used to cast the spell, you can either make a
melee spell attack and touch a creature as you strike
it with darkfire or you can make a
ranged spell attack against a
creature you can see within 15
feet as rays of darkfire shoot
from your eyes. On a hit, the
creature takes 3d10 necrotic
damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When
you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or
higher, the necrotic
damage increases by
1d10 for each slot level
above 2nd.
