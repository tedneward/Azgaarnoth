---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you swing a melee weapon. An arc of brilliant light is traced in the air by the weaponâ€™s path, and the arc launches outward, threatening creatures and objects in a 5-foot wide, 30-foot line. Every creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 radiant damage, and is blinded until the start of your next turn. A creature takes half damage on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you increase the damage by 1d8 for each slot level higher than 3rd.
