#### Exploit Opening
*1st-level divination* (Bard,Ranger,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you miss with an attack roll
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
As the enemy avoids your blow, you gain a flash of
insight into its weaknesses, one that you or your
allies can exploit. The next attack roll made against
this target before the end of your next turn has
advantage. If that attack hits, it inflicts an
additional 2d8 damage of the same type as the
attack. 

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
