#### Prismatic Ray
*5th-level evocation* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a prism)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
A ray of rainbow color flashes from your hand out toward a target within range. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the creature takes 8d10 damage (1d10 for each damage type; fire, cold, lightning, acid, poison, radiant, necrotic, and force) and is stunned until the end of its next turn.

As an alternative, casters can choose to randomize the ray's effects by rolling a 1d8:

1d8 | Color | Damage Type
--- | ----- | -----------
1 | Red | 15 points of fire damage (Dexterity save for half)
2 | Orange | 25 points of acid damage (Dexterity save for half)
3 | Yellow | 30 points of lightning damage (Dexterity save for half)
4 | Green | 35 points of poison damage (Constitution save for half)
5 | Blue | 40 points of cold damage (Constitution save for half)
6 | Indigo | 45 points of thunder damage (Dexterity save for half)
7 | Violet | 50 points of force damage (Dexterity save for half)
8 | Multihued | Roll twice, ignoring this result

Casters choose which variant they are using at the time of its casting.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th. No one damage type can be increased by more than 1d10.
