---
Your hand goes numb and a ray of bright blue 
energy leaps toward a creature of your choice that 
you can see within range. Make a ranged spell 
attack. If you hit the target takes 2d6 cold damage 
and is encased in a thick sheet of ice. The target can
breathe, but it is incapacitated and takes 2d6 points
of cold damage every round.
The target or a creature within 5 feet of it can use
its action to make Strength check against your
spellcasting DC to free the target from the ice. Any
fire damage inflicted on the target begins to melt
the ice as well, but the target isn't free until 20
points of fire damage have been inflicted. Once the
target is freed from the ice, the spell ends.
