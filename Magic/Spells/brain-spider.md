---
You can eavesdrop on the thoughts of up to eight other creatures at once. The targets must each make an Intelligence saving throw. For the creatures that fail their saving throws, you can choose to perceive your choice of one of the following for 1 minute, making a new choice at the end of each minute:

* The surface thoughts of all creatures who failed their saving throw, in any order.
* Information from all eight creature's minds on one subject of your choice.
* Insight from one of the target creatures into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and information on either one subject of your choice of your choice or on something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates).

For the duration, as an action on your turn, you can implant a suggestion in the mind of one of the creatures with whom you are connected, as per the [suggestion](./suggestion.md) spell. If a creature resists your suggestion, it is immune to any further attempts, but it is not freed from the *brain spider*.
