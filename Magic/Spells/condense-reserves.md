- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You create a temporary channel between your reserves of magical energy to enable the fueling of your more powerful spells. If you have at least two 1st level spell slots aside from the slot spent to cast this spell, you spend those two spell slots to gain a 2nd level spell slot. The spell slot gained from use of this spell disappears at the end of a short rest or long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you spend two spell slots of the same level as the slot spent to cast this spell, gaining a spell slot one level higher than the spell slots spent.
