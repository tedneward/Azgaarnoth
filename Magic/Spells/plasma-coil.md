#### Plasma Coil
*9th-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action 
- **Range:** 30 feet 
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
---
You evoke a whip-like cord of writhing plasma in your free hand The whip sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet and lasts for the duration. If you let go of the whip, it disappears, but you can evoke the whip again as a bonus action. 

You can use your action to lash out with the whip, which stretches and weaves between foes. Up to five targets of your choice that you can see within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes Sd8 lightning damage and Sd8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Objects automaÂ­tically fail the saving throw.

Damage from this spell ignores resistance, and it ignores immunity to lightning damage when dealing damage to objects.
