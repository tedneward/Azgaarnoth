# Kelemvor's Irradiating Beam
*7th-level evocation* (Cleric, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (holy symbol of Kelemvor)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a beam of radiant energy that burns undead creatures in a 20-foot radius cylinder up to 100 feet tall centered on a point that you can see within range. The cylinder is considered difficult terrain for undead creatures. When an undead creature enters the cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the undead creature takes 6d10 radiant damage or half as much on a success. Incorporeal undead automatically fail the save and take maximum damage from the spell. Living creatures are unaffected by the cylinder and it is not difficult terrain for them.

Additionally, the cylinder sheds bright light for 60 feet from its center and dim light for another 20 feet.

If you're within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 30 feet as a bonus action.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 7th.
