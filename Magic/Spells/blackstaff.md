You touch a staff and imbue it with a shimmering black radiance. For the duration, the staff has the following qualities:

* The staff can't harm the caster or any creature that was touching it when the spell was cast.
* Melee attacks with the staff are made with advantage.
* The staff is considered a magic weapon that deals 3d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit.
* The staff absorbs any spell cast upon it, and can't be affected by any spell other than a wish, antimagic ray, or antimagic shell.

In addition, at the beginning of each of the wielder's turns, the wielder can choose one of the following special effects:

* On a successful melee attack with the staff, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by 3d4. The target's hit point maximum can only be restored by greater restoration or similar magic.
* On a successful hit, the staff casts dispel magic on the target as if you had cast it at its lowest level.
* On a successful hit, the target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw, or it can't cast spells until the end of its next turn.
* On a successful hit, the target is indecisive and can't use an Attack action on its next turn. 
* On a successful hit, roll for a random effect on the following table:

d100 Roll | Effect
--------- | ----------
01-45 | No effect.
46-65 | The target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be affected by confusion until the end of its next turn.
66-75 | The target must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
76-85 | Plus 2d8 force damage and the target must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be affected by fear until the end of its next turn.
86-95 | The target must make a successful Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet in the opposite direction and knocked prone.
96-00 | The target must make a successful Intelligence saving throw, or be affected by feeblemind until the end of its next turn.

The blackstaff can be used by any creature proficient with staffs; however, for the duration, a creature touching the staff can't cast spells. In addition, if a creature within reach tries to cast a spell, the staff's wielder can make an opportunity attack against the caster. On a hit, the caster's spell fails.
