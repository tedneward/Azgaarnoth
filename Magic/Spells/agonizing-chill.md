#### Agonizing Chill
*5th-level enchantment* (Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You afflict a creature you can see within range  with a crippling cold that fills its entire body. The creature immediately takes 3d10 cold damage, then must make a Constitution saving throw or be affected by the spell for the duration. A creature that is immune to cold damage is unaffected by this spell.

An affected creature's movements are slowed by the oppressive cold filling its body. Its speed is halved; it suffers a â€“2 penalty to its AC; it has disadvantage on attack rolls, Dexterity checks, and Dexterity saving throws; it has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells; it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both; and it can't take reactions.

At the end of each of the affected creature's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 3d10 cold damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th.
