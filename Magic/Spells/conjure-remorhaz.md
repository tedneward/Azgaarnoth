You summon a
celestial in the form of
a young remorhaz . It
appears in an
unoccupied space that
you can see within
range. The celestial
functions in all ways as
a remorhaz. The remorhaz disappears when it drops
to 0 hit points, or the spell ends.
The remorhaz is friendly to you and your allies for
the duration. The remorhaz acts on its own
initiative each turn, but obeys your verbal
commands if they do not violate its alignment. If
you do not give the remorhaz any commands, it
defends itself, but takes no other actions.
