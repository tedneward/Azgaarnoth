---
A three-foot tear in reality, filled with gnashing teeth and writhing tongues, extends from your hand like the blade of a sword. As part of the action of casting this spell, and as an action on each of your turns for the duration, you can make a melee spell attack. If you hit, the target takes psychic damage equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and it must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it becomes frightened of the blade and the one wielding it until the spell ends.

The blade is not a real weapon. You can't drop it, and it remains on your person until the spell ends.
