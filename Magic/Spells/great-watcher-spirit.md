---
A great ancestral spirit, wielding the primal life
energies of the earth, watches over a creature you
choose within range, warning it of danger and
helping it to take advantage of opportunities. The
creature's next weapon attack that hits before the
end of its next turn inflicts an additional 2d6
psychic damage.
In addition, until the end of the creature's next
turn, attack rolls against it are made with
disadvantage, and it has resistance to necrotic
damage.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
1st.
