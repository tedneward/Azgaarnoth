- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of wolf fur and a canine tooth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Your right hand turns into a powerful set of wolf
jaws. For the duration, when you take the Attack
action you can make a melee weapon attack against
a creature within 5 feet with the wolf jaws. On a hit,
the creature takes 2d6 piercing damage. If you have
the Extra Attack feature or another ability that
allows you to make extra attacks, you can make
multiple attacks using the wolf jaws.

You can choose to end the transformation using a
bonus action, and when doing so, you can choose to
eliminate the damage inflicted from the last attack
using the jaws. While the transformation is in
effect, you can't perform the somatic components of
spells with the transformed hand.
