You create pressurized geysers of poisonous acid that spray upward in a 15-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder in a location you specify within range. Each creature in the cylinder or on the ground within 15 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw.

On a failed saving throw, a creature in the cylinder takes 6d4 acid damage plus 2d8 poison damage, and it is hurled 30 feet up to the top of the cylinder and then falls unless it can fly or stop the fall On a successful saving throw, it takes half as much damage and isn't hurled upward A creature outside the cylinder that fails its saving throw takes 2d4 acid damage as it is pelted by acidic showers, and takes no damage on a success.

The spell also creates a cloud of invisible noxious gas that fills a 25-foot radius sphere centered on the bottom of the cylinder. The cloud spreads around corners and lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the cloud, ending the spell Any creature that ends its turn in the cloud must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 poison damage and be poisoned until the end of its next turn. Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeed on this saving throw.
