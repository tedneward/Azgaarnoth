You conjure fey spirits to temporarily inhabit up to three Small or larger non-creature plants you can see within range. Until the spell ends, each target is a creature and uses the statistics for an awakened tree (CR 2), except that it can't speak, it has Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, and it is considered a fey as well as a plant. 

When the spell is cast, each target uproots, grows to size Large if smaller, gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and gains senses similar to a human's. The plants are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the plants as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you), If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

When a target is reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends, it stops being a creature and becomes inanimate once again, returning to its original size in the process. The plant then takes root in its current location if possible. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the number of plants you can target increases by one.
