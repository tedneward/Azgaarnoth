#### Bend Time

- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You wrap yourself in a shimmering stasis field, temporarily warding yourself from the triggering damage. You roll 3d8, add your spellcasting ability modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the triggering damage by that total.

However, this damage has only been delayed. At the end of your next turn, you take damage equal to the amount by which the damage was reduced, or the total damage you would have suffered if you had not cast this spell (whichever is lower). This damage is of the same type as the triggering damage, and it cannot be reduced by any means.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can roll an additional 1d8 to for each spell level above 2nd.
