#### Whirling Blade
*2nd-level transmutation* (Artificer,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60-foot line
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bladed weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You throw the weapon in your hand, which is then
animated to strike on its own, attacking creatures in
a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide emanating from
you. Choose up to four creatures you can see within
the line. Make a melee spell attack against each
target. On a hit, a target takes 3d8 magical damage
of the same type that the weapon would inflict.
After these attacks, the weapon remains floating
in mid-air in a space of your choice that you can see
within 5 feet of whichever one of your chosen
targets was farthest away from you, whether you hit
that target or not.
After this spell is cast, until the end of your next
turn, if the weapon is still on the same plane of
existence as you, you can summon that weapon as a
bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport
instantly to your hand.
