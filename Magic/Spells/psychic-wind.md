A 5-foot wide line of whispers shoots from your mouth, carrying with it the force of words.

Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw, or take 1d6 psychic damage and become psychically [shaken](../../Conditions/Shaken.md) until the start of its next turn.

For the duration, as bonus action, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 3rd.
