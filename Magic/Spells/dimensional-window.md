# Dimensional Window
*1st-level conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a miniature magnifying glass)

**Duration**: 10 minutes

You create a dimensional window 4 feet high and 4 feet wide, on any surface, allowing you to see through the surface material to a depth of 2 feet. If there is an open area beyond the solid material, you can view it as if looking through a window. Creatures on the other side of this surface are unaffected by this spell as the surface remains unchanged to them. Only you can see through the window. To all other creatures this appears to be a translucent illusion over the otherwise solid surface.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, one additional creature you touch when you can see through the window for each slot level above 1st.
