**Casting Time:** 1 action

You create a whip made of scorching flame and select one creature within range, with the intention of unbalancing it. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 5d8 fire damage and you choose to knock it prone or to pull it up to 30 feet closer to your location.

***At Higher Levels:*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and you can pull the target an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
