# Guillotine
*1st-level conjuration* (Pale Master, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You extend your hand and touch a creature while muttering the passing prayer of an executioner. The creature must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained by a pair of ethereal chains that bind the target to the ground, and a large magical blade is summoned above their head.

As a bonus action on your turn, you are able to release the blade down upon your target's neck, dealing 2d8 magical slashing damage. For every round that you do not release the blade with your bonus action after the initial cast, add 1d8 additional damage as a blade ratchets another notch higher above the target.

The target may use their action to attempt a Strength saving throw to break the chains at the start of each turn. This removes the restrained condition and ends the spell without doing any damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
