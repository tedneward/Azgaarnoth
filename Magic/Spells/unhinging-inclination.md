# Unhinging Inclination
*Divination cantrip* (Bard, Cleric)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature and attempt to sear their mind with pain depending on how different their beliefs are from your own. Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can see. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 force damage if its moral identity (good, neutral, or evil) differs from your own. Additionally, if the target's ideals towards society and order (lawful, neutral, or chaotic) also differ from your own, it takes an additional 1d4 force damage. If the target shares your alignment, the spell has no effect. This spell does not reveal a creature's alignment to you.

Both instances of this spell's damage increase by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
