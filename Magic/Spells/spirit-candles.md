You create up to three ghostly blue flames within range, which hover in the air and burn without producing heat or using oxygen. Each flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the flames up to 30 feet to a new spot within range. A flame winks out if it exceeds the spell's range, or if you cast this spell again.
