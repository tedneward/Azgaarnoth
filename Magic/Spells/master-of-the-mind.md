You attune yourself to the rhythms of the planes,
acting in harmony with the multiverse and
perceiving the transitory nature of the time. Until
the spell ends, you have advantage on all saving
throws, and whenever you succeed on a saving
throw, you can choose to gain a number of
temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting
ability modifier.
In addition, for the duration, once during each of
your turns when you inflict damage on one or more
creatures, you can choose one target of that damage
and deal an extra 1d12 psychic damage to it.
