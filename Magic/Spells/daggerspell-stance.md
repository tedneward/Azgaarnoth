You create a powerful barrier of silver force that protects your weapons and the arms that bear them. For the duration, you gain the following benefits:

* You can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using one-handed weapons that inflict piercing or slashing damage.

* You cannot be forced to drop a one-handed weapon you are holding.

* Each time you hit with a melee attack using a one-handed weapon that inflicts piercing or slashing damage, you inflict an additional 1d4 force damage.

* While you have a light or simple melee weapon in each hand, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

* Whenever you inflict piercing or slashing damage on a creature more than once during your turn, you gain advantage on saving throws against spells cast by that creature until the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain
your concentration on the spell for up to 1 hour.
