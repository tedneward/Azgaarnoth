As a bonus action on your turn, you are able to create a weapon from the very life-force that sustains you. Casting this spell causes you to immediately take 1d6 psychic damage, as a small blade that resembles a dagger made of flowing blood appears clutched in your hand.

Attacks with this weapon use your spellcasting modifier for attack rolls and deal 1d4 slashing damage. Attacks from this weapon are also considered magical and you cannot be disarmed. You can only have one blood dagger created by this spell active at a time. The dagger disappears if it leaves your hand or you dismiss it as a bonus action.

The damage dealt by this weapon increases by 1d4 at 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
