#### Unshakable Bond
*4th-level divination* (Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a hostile creature you can see within 30 feet of you hits with an attack that damages you or one of your allies
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
In the split-second a creature lets its guard down
after it makes a successful attack, you batter your
way into its mind. The creature that inflicted the
triggering damage must make a Wisdom saving
throw. It takes 4d10 psychic damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
On a failed save, until the spell ends, you also gain
all of the following benefits against the target:
* As long as you and the target are on the same
plane, you always know its location, and if you
share a language you can communicate with it
telepathically.
* The target can't become hidden from you, and if
it's invisible, it gains no benefits from this
condition against you.
* The target provokes opportunity attacks from
you even if it takes the Disengage action before
leaving your reach.
* While you are on the same plane as the target,
you always know its surface thoughts what is
most on its mind in that moment and as your
action on each turn until the spell ends, you can
attempt to probe deeper into the creature's
mind, as if with the detect thoughts spell.
If you or the target are knocked unconscious or
killed, the spell ends early.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the psychic
damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above
4th.
