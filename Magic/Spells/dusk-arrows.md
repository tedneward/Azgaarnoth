# Dusk Arrows
*4th-level necromancy* (Bard, Cleric, Pale Master, Ranger, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You touch a quiver containing arrows or bolts. When a target is hit by a ranged weapon attack using a piece of ammunition drawn from the quiver, the target takes an extra 1d8 necrotic damage. The spell's magic ends on the piece of ammunition when it hits or misses, and the spell ends when twelve pieces of ammunition have been drawn from the quiver.

If a target dies as a result of your ranged attack while using this ammunition, its flesh melts away and it is raised as a [skeleton](/Creatures/Skeleton.md) under your control for 8 hours, after which time it stops obeying your commands and will attack you until destroyed. You may control up to 4 skeletons at a time with this spell. If you attempt to take control of another skeleton with a dusk arrow when 4 are currently under your control, you will lose control of the skeleton that has been under your control the longest, and it will attack you.

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command a skeleton raised by a dusk arrow if it is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). Undead and constructs killed with dusk arrows to not become skeletons under your control. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can control one additional skeleton for each slot level above 4th.
