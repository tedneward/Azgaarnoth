Your touch hurts and confuses your opponent, allowing you to psychically track its panic and anger to prevent its escape.

Make a melee spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 psychic damage, and you gain the following benefits until the end of your next turn:

* You and friendly creatures within 5 feet of you ignore half cover and three-quarters cover when attacking the target creature.
* The target can't become hidden from you, and if it's invisible, it gains no benefits from this condition against you.
* The target provokes opportunity attacks from you even if it takes the Disengage action before leaving your reach.
* You gain advantage on all Wisdom checks to find the target or discern information about it.
* If you and the target share a language, you can communicate telepathically with it as long as it is within 30 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the psychic
damage inflicted increases by 1d10 for each slot level
above 2nd.
