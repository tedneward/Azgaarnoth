You transform any large quantity of water within a
10-foot cube centered on a point you choose into a
deadly poison. This spell only affects bodies of
water of at least 10 gallons or more within the
affected area, not separate smaller quantities of
water. It can also be liquid that is mostly water
(such as blood, sewage, or wine), but a living
creature's vital fluids cannot be affected. Any
creature with its head or one of its breathing
passages (such as a humanoid's nose or mouth)
currently submerged into water you have
transformed with this spell must make a make a
Constitution saving throw at the beginning of any
turn in which they are so submerged.

On a failure, the creature is poisoned for the
duration, and they take 4d8 poison damage. If the
creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its
Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. On a success,
the creature can choose to spit the water out and
take no damage, or continue to swallow it and take
half damage. If the creature failed its save, at the
start of each of the creature's turns before the spell
ends, it must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw or take 3d10 poison damage. On a successful
save, the spell ends.

Creatures who do not need to save against the
spell but who are within 5 feet of the transformed
water can use an action to apply poison to one
weapon, piece of ammunition, or portion of food or
drink. Once applied, the poison retains potency for
the duration of the spell or until someone must save
against it. If a creature is struck with the poisoned
weapon or ammunition, or if it ingests the poisoned
food or drink, it must make a Constitution save or
be poisoned for the duration and take 1d8 poison
damage, or 2d8 if the poison is ingested. If the
creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its
Constitution score is reduced by 1d4. Creatures that
succeed on their save take half damage, but suffer
no other effects.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell
using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can
affect one additional creature who is drinking at the
same time, and the damage increases by 1d8 for
each slot level above 5th.
