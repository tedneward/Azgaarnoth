#### Ripen
*1st-level transmutation* *(ritual)* (Druid,Ranger)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
While casting this spell you touch an immature
plant. The plant transforms into a mature member
of its species. If the plant is a fruit bearing variety,
then it is laden with ripe fruit. You can pick 1d4+1
pieces of fruit. The fruit remains ripe and
nourishing for 24 hours, then rots. When a creature
eats one or pieces of this fruit that are still ripe
during a short rest, if it regains hit points by
spending Hit Dice at the end of that rest, it regains
extra hit points equal to your spellcasting ability
modifier. If the creature has also received any
magical healing during that rest, the number of
extra hit points it regains from this spell is doubled.
