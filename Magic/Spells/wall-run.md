For a brief moment, you treat the law of gravity as a
suggestion rather than a rule. Until the end of the
turn, you have a climbing speed equal to your
walking speed and you have advantage on Dexterity
(Acrobatics) and Strength (Athletics) checks that
involve movement. For the same duration, you can
move up, down, and across vertical surfaces while
leaving your hands free. This does not allow you to
move upside down along ceilings. If you are on a
vertical surface when you no longer have a climbing
speed, you immediately fall unless you have some
other means of remaining there.
