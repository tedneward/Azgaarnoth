- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S (a piece of ammunition)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You touch a piece of ammunition and instantly
make a weapon attack with it, just as if you were
attacking with a weapon that is normally used to
fire that type of ammunition. If multiple weapons
use that type of ammunition, you choose which of those weapons this attack emulates. This attack is
made exactly as if you were using the weapon
emulated. The cantrip does not confer any other
benefits beyond those stated above (such as weapon
proficiency).
At Higher Levels.  This spell's damage increases
when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, if the
attack hits, it deals an extra 1d4 force damage to the
target. This extra damage increases to 2d4 at 11th
level and 3d4 at 17th level.
