___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 60 feet 
- **Components:** V, S, M (the corpse of a rat) 
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute 
---
You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into a vector for magical disease. The target and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 2d6 poison damage and 1d8 necrotic damage and becomes poisoned until the spell ends. On a successful saving throw, it takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.

A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 2d6 poison damage and 1d8 necrotic damage on a failure, and ending the effect on itself on a success. 

Each time the target fails its saving throw at the end of its turn, each other creature of your choice within 10 feet of the target that isn't already poisoned by the spell must make a Constitution saving throw, with the same effects as the spell's initial saving throw. 

Creatures that are immune to disease are immune to the spell. Once a creature has successfully saved against the spelL it is immune to that casting of the spell. Any creature that is poisoned by this spell can be cured by any effect that cures diseases. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the necrotic damage dealt increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 3rd.
