*4th-level evocation* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
A continuous beam of piercing magical force is shot from your hand. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature or object. On a hit, the target takes 5d6 force damage and 5d6 piercing damage. The spell ends immediately after attacking a creature. Objects and structures take double damage from the ray.

If you target an object or structure, you can maintain the beam on the target for the duration, dealing 3d6 force damage and 3d6 piercing damage to the target when you start your turn, and another 3d6 force damage and 3d6 piercing damage as an action.

If you move in any way, are attacked, make a saving throw, or take any other actions, the spell ends.For every 5 points of total damage the beam deals to an unattended nonmagical object or structure, the beam produces 6 inches of length for a 3-inch diameter tunnel through the object or structure. When you cast the spell, you may choose to narrow the beam’s width to reduce the tunnel’s diameter down to as little as 1-inch.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you increase the piercing damage by 2d6 for each slot level above 4th.
