---
You gamble some of your own life force on a curse
that bedevils your enemy but may empower you.
You can not cast this spell if you currently have less
than 5 hit points. Choose a conscious living creature
within range that can see or hear you. The target
makes a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, the target
takes 1d4 psychic damage. You also take the same
amount of psychic damage, which cannot be
reduced or redirected in any way.
Before the beginning of your next turn, if the
target is hit with an attack, it takes an additional 1d4
necrotic damage, and the spell ends. When this
happens, you also gain temporary hit points equal
to your spellcasting ability modifier plus the
amount of necrotic damage the creature took.
The necrotic damage increases by an extra 1d4
when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and
17th level (4d4).
