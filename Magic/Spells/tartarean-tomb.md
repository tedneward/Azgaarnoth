#### Tartarean Tomb
*7th-level conjuration* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 70 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (iron shackles)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You summon spiked iron plates that surround and
impale a target within range. One target you choose
within range must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failure, it takes 8d8 piercing damage and
becomes restrained for the duration. On a success,
it takes half as much damage and is not restrained.
Restrained targets are entombed and impaled by
the iron plates. While the target is restrained by this
spell, attack rolls against it automatically fail, and it
cannot take any action requiring the use of its
limbs, except to make a Strength (Athletics) check
against a DC equal to your spell save DC. On a
success, the target escapes the tomb, and the spell
ends.
