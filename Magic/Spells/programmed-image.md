---
This spell functions the same as silent image, except
that the image remains invisible until triggered. You
decide what triggers the image when you cast the
spell, but the trigger must be audible, tactile,
olfactory, or visual. The most typical triggers
include touching an object that had the spell cast
upon it, stepping within 10 feet of the point where
the spell was cast, or speaking a certain phrase.
Once triggered, the image appears at the point
where you cast the spell and lasts for 10 minutes,
after which time the spell ends. You can pre-
program the image to move around once activated,
in a similar manner to silent image.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
an 8th level spell slot you can add sound to the
image.
