You sing of cold winters and hot summers, of dragons and elementals, of brave heroes that venture to burning lands and frozen wastes for glory and honor. As the song plays, you can not speak or cast a spell, or take any action other than moving or performing this song.

As part of performing this song, you can use an action to activate one of the following effects.

* **Stanza of Ice:** One creature of your choice within range gains 3d6 temporary hit points, which last until they finish a short rest or long rest. A glowing mote of frigid air appears hovering at a point you can see within range. The mote explodes, and every creature within a 10-foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 cold damage on a failed save, and takes half damage on a success.

* **Stanza of Fire:** One creature of your choice within range gains 3d6 temporary hit points, which last until they finish a short rest or long rest. A glowing mote of ï¬‚ames appears hovering at a point you can see within range. The mote explodes, and every creature within a 10-foot radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, and takes half damage on a success.
