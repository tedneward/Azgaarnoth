___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a metal ring)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
You project your thoughts into another creature's
mind so completely that for a moment it takes on
your intentions instead of its own. As an action, you
target a creature within range that you can see or
which has communicated with you since the
beginning of your last turn. The target must make
an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the
target is charmed by you until the end of its next
turn, and during that turn, you choose the target's
movement and its action. On a successful save, the
target is unaffected.
