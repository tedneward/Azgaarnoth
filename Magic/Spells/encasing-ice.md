# Encasing Ice
*8th-level conjuration* (Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of water)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a block of ice at a location within range. The ice consists of up to three 15-foot-cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. The ice is a magical object with 20d6 + 100 hit points and 16 AC. It grants cover and occupies space. It has immunity to cold damage, vulnerability to bludgeoning, fire, and thunder damage, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by nonmagical weapons. The ice lasts until it reaches 0 hit points or the spell ends.

Each creature in the ice when it appears can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it uses its reaction to move up to half its speed so that it is no longer within the block of ice. Otherwise, it is trapped in the ice.

The ice is translucent, so things can be seen through it, and the inside is lightly obscured. When you cast the spelL you choose whether the ice is hollow or not:

* **Hollow.** Each creature trapped in the ice block is pushed entirely inside the ice if it wasn't already. The inside is cool and lightly obscured by mist, and the walls of the ice are 1 foot thick.
* **Not Hollow.** Each creature trapped in the ice block is restrained until the spell ends or it escapes. A trapped creature must make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns, taking 6d10 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. Any creature whose space is entirely within the ice is also paralyzed and can't breathe while restrained by it.
  A creature restrained by the ice can use its action to attempt to escape by breaking free of the ice, even if it is paralyzed by the ice. It makes a Strength check against your spell save DC, with disadvantage if its paralyzed by the ice. On a success, it frees itself and breaks the ice in its space. When the ice surrounding a creature is broken in this way, it is freed even if it didn't attempt to escape. Every 5-foot cube portion of ice that is broken reduces the block's hit points by 15.
