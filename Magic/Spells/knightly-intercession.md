#### Knightly Intercession
*3rd-level conjuration* (Cleric,Paladin)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when a creature you can see within range is hit with a melee attack
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a melee weapon)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You call out a prayer for protective intercession which teleports the creature that made the triggering attack to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The triggering attack hits you instead, and you can then make one melee weapon attack against the attacker. If that attack hits, it deals an extra 1d10 radiant damage.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
