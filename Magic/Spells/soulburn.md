*3rd-level evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you take damage

This retributive spell allows you to use your Soul Objectâ€™s reservoir as a method of causing harm to a creature that has harmed you. As a reaction when you tsake damage, you can choose a number of hit points to expend from your Soul Object, and deal that amount of psychic damage to the creature that harmed you (provided it is within range). The target creature can make an Intelligence saving throw, taking half damage on a successful save.
