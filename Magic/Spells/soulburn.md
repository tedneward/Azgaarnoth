# Soulburn
*3rd-level evocation* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you take damage

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (Soul Object or Soul Object duplicate)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

If you are a [Soulbinder](/Classes/Wizard/Soulbinding.md), this retributive spell allows you to use your [soul object](/Classes/Wizard/Soulbinding.md#soulbond)â€™s reservoir as a method of causing harm to a creature that has harmed you. As a reaction when you tsake damage, you can choose a number of hit points to expend from your Soul Object, and deal that amount of psychic damage to the creature that harmed you (provided it is within range). The target creature can make an Intelligence saving throw, taking half damage on a successful save.

If you are not a [Soulbinder](/Classes/Wizard/Soulbinding.md), this spell has no effect and serves no purpose.
