# Amnesia
*9th-level enchantment* (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S , M (an unmarked slate)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to wipe the memories from the mind of one creature that you touch. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 12d6 psychic damage and the target's mind is sent reeling as it attempts to hold onto its memories. On a successful saving throw, the target takes half damage and can't take reactions until the start of its next turn, but is  otherwise not affected by the spell and the spell ends.

Creatures whose minds are reeling from this spell are stunned. A creature reeling from this spell must also make another Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed saving throw, it takes 6d6 psychic damage. If it saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails saves three times, it becomes unconscious until the spell ends and it stops making these saving throws. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

You can choose to protect the target's mind from the worst of the spell's ravages when you cast it. If you do, the spell's damage cannot reduce the target to below 1 hit point. 

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the target loses all of its memories and the spell ends. It gains one level of exhaustion, and if it isn't unconscious, it becomes unconscious. It stays unconscious for at least 1 hour after losing its memories, regardless of its hit points.

A creature who has lost its memories knows nothing about themselves or their past, but it remembers most general ideas about the way the world is arranged and how things work. It retains its inclinations, likes, dislikes, and fears (towards food, ideas, people, etc.} but it will not know of these feelings until it encounters them, and these feelings are much more malleable and easier to change than a creature who has memories to ground its feelings in. It retains all its skills and abilities, including spellcasting, though it will not initially remember that it has most skills or abilities.

Once a creature has lost its memories due to this spell it will develop a new (perhaps similar) identity and begin forming new memories without any issue, but it will not naturally regain the memories it lost. Once a year it must make an Intelligence saving throw with disadvantage. It may also make this saving throw on rare occasions where it encounters something that might spark its memory, at your DM's discretion. On a successful saving throw, it recovers all its lost memories, which causes it to become stunned until the end of its next turn.

The spell can also be ended by [greater restoration](), [heal](), or [wish]() cast as an 8th-level or higher spell.
