---
You touch one creature that you can see and attempt to wipe its memories away using magic. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 12d6 psychic damage and the target's mind is sent reeling as it attempts to hold onto its memories. On a successful saving throw, it takes half as much damage and can't take reactions until the start of its next turn, but is otherwise not affected by the spelL and the spell ends. 

Creatures whose minds are reeling from this spell are stunned. A creature reeling from this spell must also make another Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed saving throw, it takes 6d6 psychic damage. If it saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails saves three times, it becomes unconscious until the spell ends and it stops making these saving throws. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the target loses all of its memories and the spell ends. It gains one level of exhaustion, and if it isn't unconscious, it becomes unconscious. It stays unconscious for at least 1 hour after losing its memories, regardless of its hit points. A creature who has lost its memories knows nothing about itself or its past, but it remembers most general ideas about the way the world is arranged and works. It retains its inclinations, preferences, likes, dislikes, and fears (towards food, concepts, people, etc.) but it won't recall that it has these feelings until it encounters them anew, and these feelings are much more malleable and easier to change than a creature who has memories to ground its feelings in. It retains all its skills and abilities, including spellcasting, though it will not initially know that it has many of its skills or abilities. 

Once a creature has lost its memories due to this spelL it will develop a new (perhaps similar) identity and begin forming new memories without any issue. It will not naturally regain the memories it lost. Instead, once per year it must make an Intelligence saving throw with disadvantage. It may also make this saving throw on rare occasions where it encounters something that might spark its memory, at your DM's discretion. On a successful save, it permanently recovers all its lost memories and is stunned until the end of its next turn. Memories can also be restored by [greater restoration](greater-restoration.md), [heal](heal.md), or [wish](wish.md) cast at 8th-level or higher. The spell's damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1.
