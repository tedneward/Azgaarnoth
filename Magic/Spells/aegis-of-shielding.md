# Aegis of Shielding
*3rd-level abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when a creature within range succeeds on a melee attack roll that would hit one of your allies

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, M (a weapon)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You protect your ally with a barrier of invisible force. Until the end of the turn, the target of the triggering attack gains a +5 bonus to AC and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, both of which apply against the triggering attack.

After the triggering attack is resolved, the creature that made the attack takes 1d4 force damage and you mark it until the end of your next turn. While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you. This spell ends early if you are incapacitated, if you die, or if someone else marks the creature.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range increases to 60 feet, and the force damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.
