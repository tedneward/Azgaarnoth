You create a ﬂat plane bridge made of ice leading across a direction of your choice, starting from a point on solid ground you can see within 10 feet; the bridge extends through space that must be unoccupied at the time of casting. The bridge is up to 20 feet wide, 200 feet long, and 5 feet thick. It has an AC of 12, 5 hit points per inch, and is vulnerable to fire damage. You can create it at an incline or curve, and choose to make any or all of its surface area into difficult terrain.The bridge remains stationary in its initial orientation unless moved or shifted somehow. The bridge can support up to 6,000 lb. of weight before it collapses.

If the bridge is created in contact with water or other liquid, the surface of the liquid may freeze, producing a ﬂoor (AC 8, 5 hit points per inch, 3 inches thick) out to 10 feet from the ice bridge that can support up to 300 lb. before cracking or sinking. Every creature in the affected area when the liquid freezes must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 points of cold damage and is restrained until it succeeds on a Strength saving throw at the start of its turn; a creature takes half damage on a successful save.When the spell ends or is dismissed, the bridge turns to mist and anything on it falls.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a slot of 6th level or higher, you increase the maximum length by 50 feet for each slot level higher than 5th.
