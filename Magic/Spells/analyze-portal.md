You can see the outline of any magic portal within range. If you study a portal for 1 round, you can learn one of the following things:

* Any special key or command word required to activate the portal
* Any specific circumstance to activate the portal (a time of day for instance)
* Whether the portal is one-way or two-way
* Whether the portal is functioning correctly or not
* A glimpse of where the portal leads. The glimpse lasts for 1 second, and you can see about 20 feet beyond the portal

For every round you focus on the portal, you learn one more of the listed pieces of information.
