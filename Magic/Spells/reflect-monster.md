One creature you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or else your magic reflects the target into the form of an illusion. The illusion appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and it lasts until it is reduced to 0 hit points or the spell ends. 

The illusion looks and sounds exactly like the target did when the spell was cast, including any equipment it was carrying or wearing. It acts on the initiative of the target, taking its turn immediately after each of the target's turns. Its statistics are identical to the statistics that the target had when the spell was cast, except that it can't cast spells, activate magic items, use features or traits that recharge on a short or long rest, or restore hit points to a creature or object. It gains the benefits from any magic items the target had equipped, but the items are illusions and disappear if they are removed.

Unless the target is dead or at 0 hit points, you aren't able to control the illusion. Instead, the illusion spends each of its turns attempting to reduce the target to 0 hit points. Otherwise, the illusion is under your control: it acts the same as how the target would act, except it is charmed by you and treats you as a close friend. If the illusion can't be charmed, it can't be controlled.

A creature that uses an action to examine the illusion can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. Creatures that don't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or that can see through illusions, as with truesight, can automatically discern the illusion's true nature, and they have resistance to damage caused by the illusion as well as advantage on attack rolls against the illusion. 

The illusion can't move more than 150 feet away from you. If it ends its turn more than 300 feet away from you, the spell immediately ends.
