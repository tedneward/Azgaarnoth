# Sticks to Snakes
*4th-level transmutation (ritual)* (Druid, Ranger)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of sticks)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You transform a bundle of sticks into a [Swarm of Poisonous Snakes](/Creatures/Swarm-PoisonousSnakes.md). The swarm turns back into sticks when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned swarm is friendly to you and your companions. The swarm has its own turn, which immediately follows your own on the initiative order. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to it, the swarm defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.
