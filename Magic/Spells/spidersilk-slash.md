You spin your blade impossibly fast, creating silvery
strands of silk that bind nearby enemies. Choose up
to five creatures you can see within range. Make a
melee spell attack against every creature within 5
feet of you. On a hit, a target takes 5d8 force
damage and until the start of your next turn, its
speed is reduced to zero and it cannot benefit from
any bonus to its speed.
