___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a ranged or thrown weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you
must make a weapon attack with a ranged or
thrown weapon against one creature within the
spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the
target suffers the attack's normal effects, and a
shadowy duplicate of the weapon or projectile
appears, hanging in the air just short of where the
original struck. Choose one ally within 30 feet of the
target. The first time the target attacks the chosen
ally, forces the chosen ally to make a saving throw,
or includes that ally in a harmful area of effect
before the end of your next turn, the second
weapon or piece of ammunition automatically
strikes, inflicting 1d10 psychic damage.
This spell's damage increases when you reach
higher levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals
an extra 1d10 psychic damage to the target, and the
damage the target suffers for acting against the
chosen ally increases to 2d10. Both damage rolls
increase by 1d10 at 11th level and 17th level.
