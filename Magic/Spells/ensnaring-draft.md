# Ensnaring Draft
*6th-level conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

At your command, a violent draft of wind swirls around a target that you can see within range. The target must make a successful Strength saving throw or be lifted 10 feet into the air and become restrained. While a creature remains restrained and lifted by the draft, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns, to move the target up to 15 feet in any direction except vertically. The target always remains 10 feet off the ground. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
