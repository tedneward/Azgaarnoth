#### Prismatic Orb
*8th-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Eight different colors of light swirl inside an orb of transparent magical force that ﬂoats above your hand. At any given moment one or two of those colors becomes dominant within the orb until it quickly shifts towards another of the eight colors. You need a free hand to maintain the orb; the orb is dismissed if you use the hand for any other purpose, but you can evoke the orb again as a bonus action. The orb produces bright light out to 20 feet, and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

As an action, you can make a ranged spell attack with the orb against a creature within 60 feet. On a hit, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. Roll 1d8 to determine which color(s) was dominant when you hit the creature.

1. **Red.** Deals 10d6 fire damage to the creature on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.
2. **Orange.** Deals 10d6 acid damage to the creature on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.
3. **Yellow.** Deals 10d6 lightning damage to the creature on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.
4. **Green.** Deals 10d6 poison damage to the creature on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.
5. **Blue.** Deals 10d6 cold damage to the creature on a failed save, and half damage on a successful one.
6. **Indigo.** The target is restrained on a failed save, and must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns. Three successful saves end the spell. Three failed saves result in the target turning to stone permanently and being subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive.
7. **Violet.** The target is blinded on a failed save, and must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness while a failed save transports the creature to another plane of existence and also ends the blindness. (If the creature was not on its home plane, it will typically be banished home, while other creatures will be sent to the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
8. **Special.** Two colors were dominant in the surge. Roll 1d8 twice, rerolling any roll of 8 or the same color (re-roll just one of the dice if two dice were rolled at the same time). The same Constitution save result applies to both colors rolled.
