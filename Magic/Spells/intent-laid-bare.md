As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. You can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack roll and damage roll of this attack.

On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and its moment of pain gives you an opening to search your target's mind. sensing its intentions until the start of your next turn. Until then, the target cannot benefit from the disengage action, and it cannot benefit from advantage on melee attack rolls against you. In addition, for the duration, if you and the target share a language, you can communicate telepathically with it as long as it is within 30 feet.

The damage of attacks you make with this spell increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 psychic damage to the target. This extra damage increases to 2d6 at 11th level and 3d6 at 17th level.
