# Inevitable Winter
*6th-level necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (the mummified finger of a humanoid who froze to death)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You call spirits of death and winter, commanding them to surround a foe to sap its vitality. Choose one creature you can see within range. The creature takes 2d12+20 cold damage, and it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to the amount of cold damage it took from this spell, and the next time it makes a saving throw before the end of its next turn, the target must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the saving throw.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 6th.
