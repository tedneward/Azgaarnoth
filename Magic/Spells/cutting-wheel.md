You form a ﬂoating, indestructible, spinning disc of solid magical force in an unoccupied space within feet of you. The disc is about 5 feet in diameter and can ﬂy up to 30 feet per round. You can use your action to make the disc move with a mental command, but never more than 30 feet away from you. If you move the disc to push against an unattended object or structure, it deals 4d12 + 16 slashing damage to the target, and another 4d12 + 16 slashing damage every time you end your turn with the disc in contact with the target object or structure. If you attempt to move the disc into or through a creature’s space, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d8 slashing damage on a failed save.
