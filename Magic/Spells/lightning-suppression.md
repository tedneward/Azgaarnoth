___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 15 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You attempt to suppress a creature by emitting tendrils of lightning that invade throughout the creatureâ€™s body. One creature you can see within 15 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and the spell ends. If the target failed the Dexterity save, it must also make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed Constitution save, the target is paralyzed until the end of your next turn, and on a successful Constitution save, the spell ends. To maintain the spell, you must use an action on your turn in addition to concentrating on the spell. When you use an action to maintain the spell, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage and must make a second Constitution saving throw. On a failed second Constitution save, the target is paralyzed until the end of your next turn. On a success for either saving throw, the spell ends.

If you or the creature is hit by an attack or damaged by an area effect, or you take any other actions (including bonus actions and reactions) other than moving or maintaining the spell, the spell ends. If you move more than 15 feet away from the target, the spell ends.Large creatures have advantage on the Constitution saving throw. Huge or Gargantuan creatures, as well as creatures resistant or immune to lightning, are not paralyzed by this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you increase the initial lightning damage by 1d6 for each slot level higher than 3rd.
