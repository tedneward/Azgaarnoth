When you cast this spell, a circular portal, 10 feet in
diameter, opens over a point you choose within
range. You also choose a second point, which can be
at any location you have previously visited on the
same plane of existence. A second, identical portal
appears at that point.

Both portals are two-dimensional glowing rings
filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground
and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A
ring is visible only from one side (your choice),
which is the side that functions as a portal.
Any creature or object entering one portal exits
from the other portal as if the two were adjacent to
each other; passing through a portal from the
nonportal side has no effect. On your turn, you can
rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active
side faces in a different direction.

The surface of the first portal is transparent,
allowing you to see what lies beyond; however, the
surface of the second portal is a translucent gray
color. This misty grayness is opaque and blocks
vision through it to the first portal. Nevertheless,
creatures can freely pass through the active side of
each portal for the spell's duration.
