You surround your hand with jumping, twisting shadows, and your whole arm becomes semi-transparent. For the duration, when you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can choose to make the range of the spell 30 feet instead. Once per casting, you may grant yourself advantage on one melee spell attack roll.
