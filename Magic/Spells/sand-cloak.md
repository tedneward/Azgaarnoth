You create a swirling cloak of sand and dust that extends 15 feet out from you and lasts for the duration. The area moves with you. It is difficult terrain and lightly obscured for other creatures. You can use a bonus action to reduce or increase the radius of the area, up to a maximum of 15 feet.

When a creature other than you enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is buffeted by sand and dust. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the start of its next turn.
