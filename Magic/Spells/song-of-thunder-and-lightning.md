As the song plays, you can not speak or cast a spell, or take any action other than moving or performing this song.As part of performing this song, you can use an action to activate one of the following effects.Stanza of Thunder: One creature of your choice within range gains 3d6 temporary hit points, which last until they finish a short rest or long rest. A glowing mote of distorted air appears hovering at a point you can see within range. The mote explodes with a loud boom, and every creature within a 10-foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 thunder damage on a failed save, and takes half damage on a success.Stanza of Lighting: One creature of your choice within range gains 3d6 temporary hit points, which last until they finish a short rest or long rest.
