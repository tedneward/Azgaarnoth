#### Luminous Trail
*1st-level evocation* (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
---
Your hands glow with a soft luminescence, emitting bright light out to 10 feet and dim light for an additional 10 feet. For the duration, you can touch a surface to leave behind a tiny glowing symbol on it. The glowing symbol itself sheds bright light out to 5 feet and dim light for an additional 5 feet, and lasts for 12 hours. After creating five symbols, the spell ends, but the symbols remain until their own durations end or until dispelled (dispelling one symbol does not dispel the other symbols, if any).

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you increase the number of symbols you can create by three for each slot level higher than 1st.
