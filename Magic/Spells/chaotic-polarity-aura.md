# Chaotic Polarity Aura
*2nd-level enchantment* (Wizard)

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a lodestone)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You select a creature within range and create a warped magnetic field around them that randomly attracts and repels metal objects. This creates a series of rapidly changing forces, which interferes with their movements and actions. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or suffer a -2 penalty to its AC, and have disadvantage on all of its attacks, ability checks, and saving throws. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
