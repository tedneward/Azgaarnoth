As a part of the action of casting this spell, you must
ask a question of one creature within range that can
see and hear you, or else the spell fails. The
question must be phrased so that it can be
answered with a yes or a no. The target must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it replies
with a truthful answer. A creature that is immune to
being charmed or which does not share a language
with you is not affected by this spell.
