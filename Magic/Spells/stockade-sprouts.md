You cause up to four trees to magically sprout at locations of your choice that you can see on the ground within range. Each creature that is directly above one of the locations must make a Dexterity saving throw, as the trees suddenly grow to full size and form cages with their branches. On a success, a creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed to an unoccupied space to escape the branches. If it does not, it is trapped by the branches of the growing tree. 

Each creature trapped inside the branches is restÂ­rained and held at the top of the tree. A trapped creature can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. 

You decide each tree's height. They can be as short as 5 feet and as tall as 20 feet. The trunks of the trees are 3 feet wide. The trees are solid objects that provide cover, and the tops of the trees are lightly obscured by leaves. The insides of the branch cages are lined with poisonous leaves and vines. Once per turn when a trapped creature makes a weapon attack or fails an ability check to escape, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 poison damage.

When the spell ends, the trees vanish, and any creatures trapped inside are freed. A freed creature falls if it cannot fly or climb the tree using a climbing speed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of trees you can cause to sprout increases by one for each slot level above 4th.
