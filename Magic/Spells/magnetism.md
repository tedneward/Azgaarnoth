This spell allows you to draw iron or steel objects to
yourself by projecting a magnetic ray. Choose one
object within range that is nonmagical and made of
ferrous metal. This object must weigh less than 40
lbs. If the object isn't being worn or carried, it
immediately flies into your space, where you can
either catch it with your hand (requiring no action)
or let it fall at your feet.
Using an action each round, you can target one
object you can see within range of the spell with
this effect.
If an object you target with this spell is being held
or carried by a creature, that creature must roll a
Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature
drops the object, and it flies to your space, where
you either catch it with your hand or let it fall at
your feet. If the object is being worn by a creature
(like a helm or a chain shirt), the creature makes
the same Strength saving throw but has advantage
on the roll. On a failure, the creature is pulled up to
60 feet towards you if it is Medium-size or smaller.
If the item is secured in some way (such as being
chained to a wall or tied down with a rope), but not
being held or worn, you make an ability check to
break the restraint, as if you were making a Strength
check to break or burst whatever is securing it with
your own hands. Instead of making a Strength
check, you make a check with your spellcasting
ability score (adding your proficiency bonus). If the
check succeeds, you free the item and it flies to your
space as described above.
You can also attempt to move a metal creature
that weighs less than your limit for this spell (such
as a Tiny construct). The creature makes a Strength
saving throw with advantage against this effect. If
the save fails, you can move the creature toward you
just as you would any other metal object. Until this spell ends, your ability to carry, lift,
push, or drag any objects you have moved to your
space with this spell is calculated as if you had a
Strength score of 20 (giving you a carrying capacity
of 300 pounds and allowing you to push, lift, or drag
up to 600 pounds, if you are Small or Medium
sized), unless your Strength if higher.
If you move during the spell's duration, you can
choose any object that you moved to your space
with this spell which you are not carrying, lifting,
pushing, dragging, or wearing to either move with
you as you go (levitating just above the level of your
feet) or remain in the square you moved it to.
Once you move an object to your space with this
spell, you have advantage on saving throws and
opposed rolls against dropping it, and creatures
seeking to move the item from your space have
disadvantage on rolls to do so. When the spell ends,
if you are holding, wearing, or carrying an object
that is too heavy for you, it falls softly to the
ground, landing harmlessly at your feet.
At Higher Levels.  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the weight limit of
objects you can move with this spell increases by 10
pounds for each slot level above 3rd. When you cast
this spell using a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, you
can choose up to two objects within range each
time you use your action for this spell, instead of
just one. If the spell slot is 7th level or higher, you
can choose up to three objects instead.
