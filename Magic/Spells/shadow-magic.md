*5th-level illusion* (Sorcerer,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
You cast an illusory version of one of the following spells: [fireball](./fireball.md), [cone of cold](./cone-of-cold.md), or [lightning bolt](./lightning-bolt.md). Treat this as if the spell had been cast but with the following exceptions:

* Targets make a Charisma saving throw instead of the normal saving throw for the imitated spell.
* Instead of the normal damage for the imitated spell, a creatures that fails its Charisma saving throw take 4d6 necrotic damage and 4d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
* A creature reduced to zero hit points by this spell is not killed, but is stable and unconscious at zero hit points. A creature that falls unconscious due to damage from this spell can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it regains hit points equal to the psychic damage this spell inflicted.

One minute after a creature takes psychic damage from this spell, it regains a number of hit points equal to the psychic damage taken, unless it already recovered those hit points by making a successful Wisdom saving throw against this spell, as described above.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, the psychic damage and necrotic damage both increase by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 5th.
