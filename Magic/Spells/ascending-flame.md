# Ascending Flame
*Evocation cantrip* (Cleric)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A flame-like radiance burns a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 radiant (or some other energy, depending on the background of the caster--check with the DM) damage, granting you half of the damage dealt as temporary hit points. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
