Up to a number of willing creatures or objects equal to 50 x your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 50 targets) that you can see within range become invisible for the spell's duration. Anything an affected creature is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the creature's person. Each affected creature can see each other affected creature and object as if they were visible. 

The spell ends for any target that attacks or casts a spell, but remains on other targets. You can use a bonus action to end the spell's effect on any number of targets, no matter where they are. 

The spell cannot target objects that are being worn or carried by creatures that are not willing.
