#### Echoes of Cowardice
*3rd-level necromancy* (Cleric,Warlock,Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
Using your action, you conjure a sphere of barely
perceptible wisps of shadow which amplify doubts
and fears. Choose a point within range. Each
creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that
point must make a Wisdom saving throw. Creatures
that fail the saving throw fall prone and become
frightened of you until the end of your next turn. A
creature must also make the save when it starts its
turn within the sphere. A construct or an undead is
immune to this effect.

As a bonus action on each of your turns until the
spell ends, you can either move the sphere up to 15
feet or push a creature within the sphere's area up
to 15 feet away from you.
