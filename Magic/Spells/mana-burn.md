# Mana Burn
*2nd-level transmutation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a magic ball of glowing energy and launch it at a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and lose an unused 2nd level spell slot until it completes a long rest. If the target does not have any 2nd level spell slots remaining, it will lose a 1st level spell slot instead.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every slot level above 2nd. Also, the unused spell slot lost by the target is equal to the spell slot used to cast the spell. If the target does not have an unused slot level of that level to lose, they will lose a spell slot of the next lower level, and so on, until they lose an unused spell slot. If the target does not have any unused spell slots of the appropriate level, the spell does nothing and ends.
