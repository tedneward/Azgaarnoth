As you softly speak the words that finish this spell, a soft droning sound sweeps out from you. Creatures of your choice that you can see within range that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious. A creature rendered unconscious by this spell doesn't awaken unless it takes damage, someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake, or the spell ends.

Undead and creatures immune to the charmed condition aren't affected by this spell.
