You place a curse on one creature you can see within range to persist after death as an apparition. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become cursed for the duration. If it dies while cursed by the spell its soul does not pass on to the afterlife, and is instead trapped as an undead in the plane where it died. You choose the type of undead, which must be of challenge rating 4 or lower and have the Incorporeal Movement trait, such as a banshee or a ghost. If you choose anything other than a ghost, your Dungeon Master may require additional special components, or they may apply additional requirements to the target, such as only being able to create a banshee out of an elf. 

The undead appears after 2d4 + 2 hours in a random unoccupied space within 100 feet of where it died.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
