#### Freeze Projectile
*2nd-level evocation* (Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, taken when a creature you can see makes a ranged attack or casts magic missile against a creature within 25 feet of you.
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
A brief moment after a missile (including magic missile but not including rays) no larger than a 5-foot length cube is fired at a creature you can see within 25 feet of you, you evoke temporal energy to stop the projectile in mid-ﬂight within 5 feet of its target.The projectile hovers unmoving in mid-air for the duration, and automatically misses unless it is able to change its path somehow, or the projectile’s target remains in its current space (if a different creature or object occupies the space instead, that creature or object becomes the projectile’s new target). When the spell ends, the projectile continues its path immediately.
