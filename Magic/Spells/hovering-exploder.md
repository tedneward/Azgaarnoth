#### Hovering Exploder
*2nd-level evocation* (Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a stone marble, consumed in the casting)
- **Duration:** 24 hours
---
By carefully molding magical forces, you produce a hovering, intangible orb of magical force in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If a creature enters the space containing the orb, the orb will emit a momentary ï¬‚ash of light and detonate, producing an explosion of magical force in a 15-foot radius. Every creature within the affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 force damage and pushed 10 feet from the origin of explosion on a failed save, and takes half damage on a successful save. If the orb is somehow hit with a spell attack or magic weapon (AC 10) or is within a magical area effect that would damage objects, it detonates prematurely .

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
