toward it. The creature must make a Dexterity
saving throw. The target takes 6d10 lightning
damage on a failed save or half as much on a
success. The creature has disadvantage on the
saving throw if it is wearing metal armor.

a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d10 for every slot level above 4th.
