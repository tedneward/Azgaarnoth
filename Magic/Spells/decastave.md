___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a duskwood club or quarterstaff of duskwood)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
---
You transform a club or quarterstaff carved of
duskwood into a 10-foot long staff made of
punishing magical force. For the duration, you can
use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for
melee attack and damage rolls using that weapon,
your reach with the weapon becomes 10 feet, and
you inflict 1d12 force damage when you hit with it,
instead of the weapon's normal damage. The
weapon is considered magical for the duration. The
spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the
weapon.
In addition, once per turn, when you hit with the
weapon you can choose to inflict an additional 1d8
necrotic damage. You regain hit points equal to half
the amount of necrotic damage you inflicted.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the necrotic
damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
2nd.
