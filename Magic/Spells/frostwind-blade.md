___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a weapon)
- **Duration:** 1 round
---
As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee weapon attack against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. 

On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and your weapon's blow inflicts winter's wrath, leaving a frosty trail as it cuts through the air. The next time the target you hit makes an attack before the end of your next turn, it must choose either to make the attack with disadvantage or to take 1d6 cold damage and make the attack roll normally. A creature within 5 feet of you that takes cold damage from this spell reduces its speed by half until the end of your next turn.

This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage to the target, and the damage the target suffers for not taking disadvantage on its next attack increases to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th level and 17th level.
