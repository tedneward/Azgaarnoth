#### Force Push
*Evocation cantrip* (Sorcerer)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Choose one creature you can see within range. The
target must make a Strength saving throw.
Creatures of Large size have advantage on this
saving throw and creatures that are Huge or larger
automatically succeed. On a failed save, a creature
takes 1d6 force damage and you can push it up to 10
feet in a straight line away from you. It must end
this movement on a surface that can support its
weight.
This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you
reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
