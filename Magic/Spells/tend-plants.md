#### Tend Plants
*Transmutation cantrip* (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action 
- **Range:** 30 feet 
- **Components:** S 
- **Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below) 
---
You choose any number of non-creature plants that you can see within range in a 5 foot cube. This spell can affect plants that do not fit entirely within the area, but it only affects the portions of those plants that are inside the area. You manipulate the affected plants in one of the following ways.

* You change the color, taste, or texture of any of the plants' leaves, petals, or fruit. You can use this to create messages. These changes last for 1 hour. 

* You cause the plants to shake and twist, releasing any ripe fruits or ready seeds and knocking off any tiny pests such as bugs or mice. For 1 hour, such pests can't consume the plant or climb on it. This only affects Tiny creatures that don't have a level or CR greater than 0.

* You cause the plants or part of the plants to move up to 5 feet in a direction of your choice. This can't relocate a plant that is firmly rooted in the ground nor does it change the flexibility of the plants, but it can cause vines to rise and coiL branches to shake, tumbleweeds to rolL etc. This movement doesn't have enough force to cause damage. 

* You cause the plants to twist into knots. For 1 hour, the plants are difficult terrain for any creature walking through them, and climbing the plants does not cost any extra movement. 

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
