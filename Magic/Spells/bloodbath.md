You pull at the blood inside the target's body as you rip it apart in a grisly shower of magical blood that heals and invigorates you. If the target is still alive, it instantly dies. 

You regain a number of expended spell slots of a total level (distributed as you choose) no greater than your spellcasting modifier (minimum of one spell slot level). You also regain 80 hit points, end one curse, disease, or poison condition that is affecting you, and reduce your exhaustion by up to two levels. 

This spell can't restore spell slots of 6th-level or higher. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th levei the amount of hit points restored by the spell increases by 40. 

This is a Blood spell.
