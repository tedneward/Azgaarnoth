# Acid Rain
*7th-level conjuration* (Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create gloomy storm clouds 50 feet above the ground, creating a mixture of dense fog and pouring acidic rain in a 15-foot-radius, 50-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder. Its area is heavily obscured and acts as difficult terrain. A creature that ends its turn in the cylinder must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 8d10 acid damage on a failed save, or half on a success.

Additionally, each time a creature takes damage from the acid rain, metal items held or worn are exposed to the rain and might be destroyed. For metal weapons, armor, and objects, roll a d8. Non-magical metal weapons, armor, and objects are destroyed on a 3 or lower. Uncommon items are destroyed on a 2 or lower. Rare items are destroyed on a 1 or lower. Very Rare and Legendary items are unaffected.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the Duration is 8 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until you dismiss it as a bonus action.
