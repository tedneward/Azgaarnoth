- **Duration:** Instantaneous
---
Sowing the chaos of Pandemonium, you scramble
your speech and the speech of others. Choose one
creature within range that can hear you. The target
must roll a Wisdom saving throw, suffering 2d10
psychic damage on a failed save or half as much on
success. If the creature fails its save, both you and
the creature lose the power of speech until the start
of your next turn. For that duration, neither of you
can speak any language (though you can
understand others as you would normally), and
neither of you can cast any spell that requires verbal
components, nor use any spell or other effect that
requires others to be able to hear you.
At Higher Levels.  If you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the psychic damage
inflicted increases by an additional 1d10 for every
spell level above 2nd.
