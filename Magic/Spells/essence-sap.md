You siphon energy from the blood, body, and soul of one creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or else it takes 4d10 necrotic damage, it gains one level of exhaustion, and a ghostly cord of necrotic magic connects you and the target for the duration. If the target ends its turn outside the range of the spell, the cord is severed and the spell immediately ends. 

While the cord connects you, the target is poisoned, and you can use your action on each of your turns to siphon from the target, causing it to take 4d10 necrotic damage and gain one level of exhaustion. At the end of each of the target's turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw, ending the spell on a success. 

Whenever you deal necrotic damage with this spell, if the target has blood or unexpended spell slots, you can restore the use of one of your expended 1st-level spell slots or reduce your exhaustion level by 1. 

All exhaustion caused by this spell is removed from a creature when it finishes a short or long rest with food and water to snack on during the rest. The spell can't raise a creature's exhaustion level above five.
