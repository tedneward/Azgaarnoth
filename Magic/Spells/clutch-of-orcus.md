Spectral hands grab the heart of one humanoid you
can see within ranger, and start to squeeze. The
target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
successful save, the target takes 1d12 necrotic
damage and the spell ends.

On a failed save, the target is paralyzed for the
duration and takes 1d12 necrotic damage at the start
of each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns,
the target can make another Constitution saving
throw. If it succeeds on the saving throw, the spell
ends.

If the target dies during this spell, its smoking
heart appears in your hand.
