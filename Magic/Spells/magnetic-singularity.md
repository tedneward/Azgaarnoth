A bright streak ﬂashes from your pointed finger, ending in the appearance of a tiny, intangible, silvery orb at a space of your choice you can see. Gravitational forces suddenly pull on every metallic object within 30 feet of the orb, pulling them towards the orb. Unattended, unsecured metal-containing objects will immediately ﬂy towards the orb (creatures in the way might have to make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid taking improvised damage from ﬂying objects). Heavier objects may move according to the DM’s discretion. [Suggested damage: 2d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from Medium and smaller objects, 4d6 from Large objects, 6d6 from Huge objects, 8d6 from Gargantuan objects]

Every creature in the affected area wearing metal armor must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or be pulled 15 feet towards the orb, and every time it starts a turn within the affected area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled 5 feet towards the orb. An affected creature attempting to move away from the orb must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check every time it tries to move 5 feet away from the orb.

Every creature in the affected area wielding a metal-containing object must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or be pulled 5 feet towards the orb, and while in the affected area has disadvantage on any checks or attack rolls made with a metal-containing object.
