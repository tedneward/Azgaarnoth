One creature you can see within range must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or else experience hallucinÂ­ations that seamlessly overtake its reality. 

It experiences an entire hallucinatory day in a single moment of real time. You have full control over what it experiences, and you can describe the nature of the day that it lives (and can choose to make it as wonderful or nightmarish as you please). You and the DM may even act out some of the visions that it has. The illusion the target experiences is fully immersive, belied by none of the senses, and feels like unshakable reality. 

You know everything that the target experiences in this hallucination. For example, you know if it confesses to any horrible crimes or if it reveals its weaknesses or fears. The DM has final say over how the target reacts within the hallucination. At the end of the hallucination, you can choose to deal the target 30d8 psychic damage. 

After that, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage on the roll if it succeeded on its Intelligence saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it is either frightened of you orcharmed by you (your choice) for a number of days equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. The effect is not magical and can't be dispelled except by the wish spell.
