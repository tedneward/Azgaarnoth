# Runes
Runic knowledge is rare in Azgaarnoth, frequently because it is associated directly with the Eldar; it is thought that runes are, in their purest form, the expression of magic that the Eldar chose most often, or was their most powerful expression of magic (depending on which scholars are speaking on the subject). While mortals' understanding of runes is quite limited--and some scholars believe that runes only truly attained their full power when scribed by the Eldar--many scholars and magi continue to pursue the study of runes, seeking that breakthrough that will unlock the Eldars' power.

Runes are openly studied at the tiny but well-funded [School of the Eldar](/Organizations/MageSchools/SchoolOfTheEldar.md). They are constantly on the hunt for new runes or new application of existing runes, and frequently journey to the corners of Azgaarnoth in the company of paid mercenaries/adventurers to conduct their research.

Rune magic allows a character to unlock the power contained within magical symbols and sigils. Not every such mark has the potential for power. Only those runes forged in the ancient days of creation still resonate with the fundamental magic of the world. 

## Rune List
The following runes are commonly (as runes go) known across Azgaarnoth; it is not known if more runes are known to members of the School of the Eldar (or others, perhaps more ancient in knowledge or skill), but if they are, they would be learnable by any who understand any rune.

If a rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

**Skye (Cloud).** This rune channels deception and trickery and misdirection. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and Charisma (Deception) checks.

In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Ild (Fire).** This rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for 1 minute. While restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Ise (Frost).** This rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Haug (Resilience).** *(Prerequisite: 7th Level or Higher Rune Knight, or knowledge of two runes)* This rune's magic bestows resilience and fortitude. While wearing or carrying an object that bears this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance against poison damage.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Stein (Stone).** This rune's magic channels the judiciousness and wisdom. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and you have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. 

In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Uvar (Storm).** *(Prerequisite: 7th Level or Higher Rune Knight, or knowledge of two runes)* Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a seer. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you aren't incapacitated.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
