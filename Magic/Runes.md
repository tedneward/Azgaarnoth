# Magic runes
Runic knowledge is rare in Azgaarnoth, frequently because it is associated directly with the Eldar; it is thought that runes are, in their purest form, the expression of magic that the Eldar chose most often, or was their most powerful expression of magic (depending on which scholars are speaking on the subject). While mortals' understanding of runes is quite limited--and some scholars believe that runes only truly attained their full power when scribed by the Eldar--many scholars and magi continue to pursue the study of runes, seeking that breakthrough that will unlock the Eldars' power.

Runes are openly studied at the tiny but well-funded [School of the Eldar](/Organizations/MageSchools/SchoolOfTheEldar.md). They are constantly on the hunt for new runes or new application of existing runes, and frequently journey to the corners of Azgaarnoth in the company of paid mercenaries/adventurers to conduct their research.
