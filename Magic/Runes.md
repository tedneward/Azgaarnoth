# Magic runes -- STILL IN REVISION
Runic knowledge is rare in Azgaarnoth, frequently because it is associated directly with the Eldar; it is thought that runes are, in their purest form, the expression of magic that the Eldar chose most often, or was their most powerful expression of magic (depending on which scholars are speaking on the subject). While mortals' understanding of runes is quite limited--and some scholars believe that runes only truly attained their full power when scribed by the Eldar--many scholars and magi continue to pursue the study of runes, seeking that breakthrough that will unlock the Eldars' power.

Runes are openly studied at the tiny but well-funded [School of the Eldar](/Organizations/MageSchools/SchoolOfTheEldar.md). They are constantly on the hunt for new runes or new application of existing runes, and frequently journey to the corners of Azgaarnoth in the company of paid mercenaries/adventurers to conduct their research.

Rune magic allows a character to unlock the power contained within magical symbols and sigils. Not every such mark has the potential for power. Only those runes forged in the ancient days of creation still resonate with the fundamental magic of the world. 
Runes work much like magic items. You can discover them, attune to them, and use their magic in a variety of ways. However, unlike with magic items, only a character versed in Rune Lore can use all the benefits a rune offers.

## Overview
Runes are powerful icons that you can use for a variety of effects. In order to use a rune, you must normally find and keep a master rune. A master rune is a rare object - a gem or carved rock, a magical token, a shard of some special material, and so on - engraved with the rune and empowered with magic that allows you to unleash the rune’s effects. Those effects are divided into two categories.

Unless otherwise noted, you must have a master rune on your person in order to use its Abilities.

### Activation
The abilities listed in a Master Rune’s Activated Properties can be used by anyone who attunes to it. Unless otherwise specified, any abilities which require a Saving Throw use the following calculation for the DC:

**8 + Your Proficiency Modifier + Your Intelligence Modifier**

Many of these abilities have additional effects which can be activated by expending a spell slot. As with casting any Spell, if you activate a Rune Lore ability in this way, you may not cast another spell more powerful than a cantrip in the same turn.

This additional feature can only be used by a character who possesses the Rune Lore class feature.

### Imparting
The Imparted abilities of a Master Rune can be granted to one of the listed items by any attuned to the Rune over the course of a Long Rest, but the item bearing the Rune is destroyed in the Process. 

If this process creates an item with an effect which requires a saving throw, the DC for the saving throw is set using the same calculation as an Activated Ability, fixed at the time of creation. This means that if your Proficiency modifier or Intelligence Modifier change after the item is created, the DC remains unchanged.

A character with the Rune Lore class feature has two other options. Both of these other options are more complex and time consuming. If the character spends 24 hours working uninterrupted with the Rune, they can achieve one of the following.

* *Transference* – The character may transfer the Attuned Properties of the Rune into a different item without losing any of the Rune’s abilities. This destroys the original item.
* *Temporary Inscription* – The character may temporarily grant a non-magical item one of the Rune’s Imparted abilities. The item retains the Imparted Ability for a number of hours equal to the character’s Proficiency Modifier + their Spellcasting Ability Modifier. This process does not destroy the original item, however it does drain the magic from the Rune and it requires a further 24 hours  attuned to the character who performed the transfer to regain its magical properties.

## Finding Runes
A rune found as treasure is a master rune, carefully scribed into a rare object and available for use as a training tool to allow would-be rune scribes to unlock its power. Each rune discussed below is detailed as part of a master rune. Master runes and the runes they contain are treated much like magic items. They are categorized in rarity from rare to legendary, and can be placed in a campaign whenever the DM opts to place treasure. There are no common or uncommon runes.

## Buying and Selling Runes
Treat a master rune as a magic item of its equivalent rarity for the purpose of buying and selling in the campaign. Just as with other magic items, the DM will determine whether such items are available to purchase in the campaign and under what conditions.

## Identifying Runes
Runes are identified in a manner similar to magic items. Simply handling a master rune causes a strong sense of its rune’s identity to echo in a character’s mind. For example, touching a master rune item containing the kalt rune (the rune of cold) might cause you to experience a sudden chill as visions of snow and ice flash through your mind.

The identify spell immediately reveals a master rune’s Activated Abilities. You can also learn its Activated Abilities over the course of a short rest while maintaining physical contact with the rune.

## Runes and Attunement
A rune always requires attunement to use its Activated Abilities. Attuning to a master rune requires you to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it. This can’t be the same short rest used to learn the rune’s properties. This focus takes the form of carefully and repeatedly copying the rune, whether with ink and parchment or simply scribing it into
the dirt. If the short rest is interrupted, the attempt fails.

Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, you gain an intuitive understanding of how to activate the rune’s magical properties.

A master rune can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and all runes count toward your limit of magic items you can attune to. Any attempt to attune to a fourth magic item or rune fails (though a rune scribe’s Rune Mastery feature allows attunement to one
additional rune). You cannot attune to more than one copy of a rune.

You can end attunement to a rune in the same manner as with any other magic item.
