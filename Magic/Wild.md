# Magic: Wild Magic
Normally, the power wielded by those who can tap into it via arcane means do so by putting careful restrictions and limitations on it. In its raw form, this power is chaotic and unpredictable, and can cause all manner of effects both beneficial and harmful to the surrounding area.

Some arcane casters, however, have sought ways to tap into this uncontrolled force, allowing it into this world without tight controls, believing that doing so is a path to greater power. This "wild mages", as they came to be known, were particularly popular during the 

## Wild Magic Surge
A wild magic surge can happen in a variety of ways, and the effects are entirely unpredictable. If the wild surge is triggered by an individual creature's actions, roll d100 on the Individual Wild Magic Surge Effect table, below; if the surge is triggered by something else, roll on the Area Wild Magic Surge table.

If a surge effect replicates a spell which normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration. Some effects call for a saving throw; the saving throw DC is equal to your spell save DC (if the surge was triggered by a spell) or the item save DC (if the surge was triggered by a magic item).

## Wild Magic Zones
Sometimes the release of wild magic takes root temporarily within a given area, creating what's known as a wild magic zone. These zones appear without warning, but most commonly in response to the use of wild magic (typically by a [Wild Magic sorcerer](../Classes/Sorcerer/WildMagic.md) or a [Wild Mage](../Classes/Wizard/WildMagic.md), though zones have appeared in response to the rage of a [Wild Magic barbarian](../Classes/Barbarian/WildMagic.md) or even sometimes to the actions of a [Chaos](../Classes/Cleric/Chaos.md) or [Madness](../Classes/Cleric/Madness.md) cleric.) These zones are often small, measuring no more than 60 to 100 feet in diameter in a roughly circular shape, but zones as small as a single 5-foot square or as large as entire city blocks have been reported in the past. Legend tells of an entire city that disappeared into a wild magic zone, though not of what happened to it afterwards.

In addition to the effects of certain character classes' actions, a wild magic surge can be triggered by anyone who casts a spell (including cantrips), activates a magical item, or uses a magical ability while inside a wild magic zone, due to the unstable arcane forces that permeate that space. Note that for magical items, only the activation of an item will trigger a surge--a *+1 longsword*, for example, does not need to be activated to have its effects, but a *wand of magic missiles* must be activated in order to function, and would therefore trigger a surge.

These zones are often unsettling to practitioners of arcane magic; Bards, Sorcerers, and Wizards can make a Perception/DC15 check to sense the nature of the area. Sometimes, visual clues (strangely-colored or brightly-lit flora, for example, or strange etheral music or flickering lights) can provide advantage on the check.

***Using magic in a wild magic zone.*** Creatures can cast spells without difficulty (unless specified otherwise). Generally, the normal effects of a cast spell apply, in addition to any surge effects. Spells cast in a wild magic zone 

***Mantaining control in wild magic zones.*** While inside a wild magic zone, you can try to mantain control over a spell and prevent a surge from happening by succeeding on an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. It's impossible, however, to avoid surges caused by the activation of a magic item while inside a wild magic zone.
