### Entangling Web Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), rare (requires attunement)*

This tattoo is often hard to regard clearly, parts of it appearing blurred, but if studied, it reveals itself to be something akin to a spider's web or patch of bramble. The tattoo has 3 charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

As a bonus action while the tattoo is on your skin, you can expend 1 of the tattooâ€™s charges to perform one of the following:

* You cast the [web](../Spells/web.md) spell.
* You cast the [entangle](../Spells/entangle.md) spell.

Both have a spell save DC of 15.
