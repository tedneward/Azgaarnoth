### Masquerade Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), common (requires attunement)*

This tattoo appears on your skin as whatever you desire. As a bonus action, you can shape the tattoo into any color or pattern and move it to any area of your skin. Whatever form it takes, it is always obviously a tattoo. It can range in size from no smaller than a copper piece to an intricate work of art that covers all your skin.

***Disguise Self.*** As an action, you can use the tattoo to cast the [disguise self](../Spells/disguise-self.md) spell. Once the spell is cast from the tattoo, it canâ€™t be cast from the tattoo again until the next dawn.
