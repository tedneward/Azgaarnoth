### Shadowfell Brand Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), very rare (requires attunement)*

This tattoo is dark in color and abstract. While it’s on your skin, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

***Shadowy Defense.*** When you take damage, you can use your reaction to become shadowy and insubstantial for a moment, reducing the damage you take by half. Once used, this reaction can’t be used again until the next dawn.
