### Shining Path Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), common (requires attunement)*

This tattoo contains beautiful images of the sun or stars, bright beams of light, or bright flames. It glows faintly with white light, which can be dimmed at will.

As an action, you can brighten the tattoo to cast a bright light equivalent to a [light](../Spells/light.md) spell. The spell lasts until you will it to fade.
