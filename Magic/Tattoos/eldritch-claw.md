### Eldritch Claw Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), uncommon (requires attunement)*

This tattoo depicts clawlike forms and other jagged shapes. While the tattoo is on your skin, your Unarmed Strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes.

***Eldritch Maul.*** As a bonus action, you can empower the tattoo for 1 minute. For the duration, each of your melee weapon attacks can reach a target up to 30 feet away from you, as tendrils of ink launch from your weapon or unarmed strike toward the target. In addition, your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 force damage on a hit. Once used, this bonus action canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.
