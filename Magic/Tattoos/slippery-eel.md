### Slippery Eel Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), rare (requires attunement)*

This tattoo consists of images of eels, snakes, and other fast-moving reptiles. 

This tattoo has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While this tattoo is on your skin, when you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to succeed on that saving throw instead.
