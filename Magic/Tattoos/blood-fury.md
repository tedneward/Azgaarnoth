### Blood Fury Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), legendary (requires attunement)*

This tattoo evokes fury in its form and colors. While this tattoo is on your skin, you gain the following benefits:

* Your attack rolls score a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20.
* When you score a critical hit against a creature, that target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
* When a creature you can see damages you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature, with advantage on your attack roll.
