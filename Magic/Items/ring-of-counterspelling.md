# Ring of Counterspelling
*Ring, very rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard)*

You can cast a spell into this ring. Afterwards, if someone casts the spell you cast into this ring while they are within 60 feet of you, you can use a reaction to expend 1 of the ringâ€™s charges and cast [counterspell](/Magic/Spells/counterspell.md) as a 9th-level spell. This ring has 6 charges, and it regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.
