# Magical Items
I choose to use a system whereby effects can be paired with a variety of different containers; why should the properties of a *frost brand* be limited solely to swords?

Some items can only be a particular specific within the category--for example, an *animated shield* wouldn't make much sense as anything other than a shield, since an *animated breastplate* wouldn't yield any significant benefit (and possibly some drawbacks!).

## Residual Items
*Items that hold charges or periodic-based powers*

* *Clothing*: Belt, Boots, Bracers, Cape, Cloak, Gloves, Hat, Mantle, Robe, Slippers, Horseshoes

## One-shot Items
*Items that hold only one charge/use*

* Ammunition, Bead

* [*Consumable*](potions.md): Philter, Oil, Potion

* [Scroll](scrolls.md)

## Magic Item Prices
Most common items are going to price out at 250-500gp, depending on how directly useful they might be in combat, with combat items going for the higher end.

In general, consumables are going to be relatively cheap, since they're one-shots. By default, consumables are somewhere around 10% of the price of an equivalent permanent item. Potion of cure wounds, for example, as the most popular potion ever, will be 50gp.

In general, no rare, very rare, or legendary item can be purchased; selling them would almost always be an auction, and could fetch wildly-varying prices depending on where it is sold and what the item does.

For "simple" items (+1 weapons, armor, etc), with no additional embellishments or features:

* *+1 ammunition* (arrows, bolts): 25gp each
* *+1 melee weapon* (swords, axes, spears, etc): 1000gp
* *+1 ranged weapon* (bows, crossbows, etc): 1000gp
* *+1 light armor*: 1500gp
* *+1 medium armor*: 2000gp
* *+1 heavy armor*: 5000gp
* *+1 shield* or *+1 tower shield*: 1500gp
* *+1 vambrances*, etc: 1000gp

"Second-tier" items (+2 weapons, armor, etc), with no additional embellishments or features are much rarer, typically must be commissioned if not found, and often are *restricted* or *keyed*, as described below. If they can be purchased, they will often command high prices.

* *+2 ammunition* (arrows, bolts): 100gp each. +2 ammunition is the most common "second-tier" item that can be purchased, but typically only at a high-end smithy with ties to a mage school.

## Restricted Items
Many arcane item smiths have long known ways to "tie" an item to a specific collection of creatures, usually by creature type or sub-type (like *dwarven plate*, for example). Many arcane smiths have found that applying such restrictors to items can grant the item additional benefits or abilities, or extend the utility of the item (such as additional charges). Some smiths have even figured out how to add a "defense" mechanism to the restriction, so that creatures of certain categories that attempt to attune or even touch the item suffer some negative consequence.

Restriction can be deliberately forged in a magical item, applied post-completion, or in some cases, develop on its own.

Forging an item to have a restriction generally heightens its power, allowing for more charges, or perhaps to develop a new minor feature (that is in some way related to the restriction). Typically restrictions are around which kind of creatures can use the item, but some have developed to restrict how the item can be used (such as what sort of creatures can be targeted, for example), so that a *wand of magic missiles* might be restricted to only be able to affect undead and do twice the damage, or have twice the charges, or twice the range, and so on.

Restrictions cn also develop over time, based on how it is used; for example, if Ser Lemdat, the Undead Slayer, uses that *want of magic missiles* exclusively against undead armies attacking the town, the wand may develop some particular properties making it more effective against undead, such as dealing radiant damage, or shooting an extra missile at undead targets, or 

## Keyed Items
The [Umbral Forge](../../Organizations/MageSchools/UmbralForge.md) mage school has also been experimenting, in partnership with many [Soulbound](../../Classes/Wizard/Soulbinding.md) magi, to concoct new forms of magic items that are not just attuned, but bound to specific individuals, making them less (or completely un-) usable by anyone other than the individual to whom it is bound, or "keyed". This is typically done only for custom-contract forge work, and often the "keying" requires direct participation by the individual to whom it is to be bound. The keying is perfect--shapechangers, doppelgangers, and polymorphed creatures do not fool the keying magic.

For value- and rarity-calculation purposes, a keyed item is one level greater in rarity (so a common item becomes uncommon if it is keyed), and legendary-rarity items cannot be keyed. Being keyed to an item takes up one of the three items to which a creature can be attuned. Items that normally require a command word to activate now require only a thought from the keyed creature, and need not even be in the keyed creature's possession to be activated, so long as it is in sight and within 60 feet.

A keyed item never loses its binding unless deliberately unbound by means of a single [wish](../../Magic/Spells/wish.md) spell, or by casting [dispel magic](../../Magic/Spells/dispel-magic.md) on the item five days in a row per level of rarity (ten for uncommon, fifteen for rare, twenty for very rare, and twenty-five for legendary). Even in case of the keyed creature's death, the item remains keyed to that creature until unbound. Once the keying is unbound, the item can either be attuned as per the normal rules, or keyed to another creature.

Keying an item after its construction requires explicit participation by a pair of Umbral Forge magi (typically a [Ferromancer](../../Classes/Wizard/Ferromancy.md) and a [Soulbinder](../../Classes/Wizard/Soulbinding.md)), and requires a hefty donation to the school (typically in the range of 10% of the item's value, so 25gp for a keyed uncommon item, 250gp for a keyed rare item, 2,500gp for very rare, and anything north of 10,000gp for legendary). The process needs the keying creature's full participation, and takes one full day for each "level" of the item's rarity (uncommon, 2 days; rare 3 days; very rare 4 days; and legendary 5 days), allowing for only a single long rest each day during that time. An item can still only be keyed to those sorts of creatures that can wield it; a *staff of power* can never be keyed to a fighter, for example.

If a creature other than the keyed creature attempts to attune a keyed item, the attunement simply fails to take, no matter how long or what degree of effort a non-keyed creature puts in. An [identify](../../Magic/Spells/identify.md) spell will reveal the nature of the item as normal, but not its keyed nature; casting the [identify](../../Magic/Spells/identify.md) using a 2nd-level slot will reveal it is keyed, and higher-level slots will reveal greater details about the creature to whom the item is keyed: 3rd-level, the kind of creature, 4th-level, rough geographic (or planar) location relative to the item's current location, 5th-level, the creature's face or other semi-identifying characteristics, and finally with a 6th-level slot, the full details of the keyed creature.

Note that the binding is entirely one-way; a keyed item can only be bound to a single creature, but a creature could have up to three keyed items.

Many wizards will key their staves, and nobility often do so with their ruling artifacts; the Emperor of Liria, for example, is always keyed to the Sword of Liria (a *+3 sun blade*) so that only the Emperor can activate it, often as part of rituals and proclamations, and usually to verify the Emperor's identity.
