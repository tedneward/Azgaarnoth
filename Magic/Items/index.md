## Restricted Items
Many arcane item smiths have long known ways to "tie" an item to a specific collection of creatures, usually by creature type or sub-type (like *dwarven plate*, for example). Many arcane smiths have found that applying such restrictors to items can grant the item additional benefits or abilities, or extend the utility of the item (such as additional charges). Some smiths have even figured out how to add a "defense" mechanism to the restriction, so that creatures of certain categories that attempt to attune or even touch the item suffer some negative consequence.

Restriction can be deliberately forged in a magical item, applied post-completion, or in some cases, develop on its own.

Forging an item to have a restriction generally heightens its power, allowing for more charges, or perhaps to develop a new minor feature (that is in some way related to the restriction). Typically restrictions are around which kind of creatures can use the item, but some have developed to restrict how the item can be used (such as what sort of creatures can be targeted, for example), so that a *wand of magic missiles* might be restricted to only be able to affect undead and do twice the damage, or have twice the charges, or twice the range, and so on.

Restrictions cn also develop over time, based on how it is used; for example, if Ser Lemdat, the Undead Slayer, uses that *want of magic missiles* exclusively against undead armies attacking the town, the wand may develop some particular properties making it more effective against undead, such as dealing radiant damage, or shooting an extra missile at undead targets, or 

## Keyed Items
The [Umbral Forge](../../Organizations/MageSchools/UmbralForge.md) mage school has also been experimenting, in partnership with many [Soulbound](../../Classes/Wizard/Soulbinding.md) magi, to concoct new forms of magic items that are not just attuned, but bound to specific individuals, making them less (or completely un-) usable by anyone other than the individual to whom it is bound, or "keyed". This is typically done only for custom-contract forge work, and often the "keying" requires direct participation by the individual to whom it is to be bound. The keying is perfect--shapechangers, doppelgangers, and polymorphed creatures do not fool the keying magic.

For value- and rarity-calculation purposes, a keyed item is one level greater in rarity (so a common item becomes uncommon if it is keyed), and legendary-rarity items cannot be keyed. Being keyed to an item takes up one of the three items to which a creature can be attuned. Items that normally require a command word to activate now require only a thought from the keyed creature, and need not even be in the keyed creature's possession to be activated, so long as it is in sight and within 60 feet.

A keyed item never loses its binding unless deliberately unbound by means of a single [wish](../../Magic/Spells/wish.md) spell, or by casting [dispel magic](../../Magic/Spells/dispel-magic.md) on the item five days in a row per level of rarity (ten for uncommon, fifteen for rare, twenty for very rare, and twenty-five for legendary). Even in case of the keyed creature's death, the item remains keyed to that creature until unbound. Once the keying is unbound, the item can either be attuned as per the normal rules, or keyed to another creature.

Keying an item after its construction requires explicit participation by a pair of Umbral Forge magi (typically a [Ferromancer](../../Classes/Wizard/Ferromancy.md) and a [Soulbinder](../../Classes/Wizard/Soulbinding.md)), and requires a hefty donation to the school (typically in the range of 10% of the item's value, so 25gp for a keyed uncommon item, 250gp for a keyed rare item, 2,500gp for very rare, and anything north of 10,000gp for legendary). The process needs the keying creature's full participation, and takes one full day for each "level" of the item's rarity (uncommon, 2 days; rare 3 days; very rare 4 days; and legendary 5 days), allowing for only a single long rest each day during that time. An item can still only be keyed to those sorts of creatures that can wield it; a *staff of power* can never be keyed to a fighter, for example.

If a creature other than the keyed creature attempts to attune a keyed item, the attunement simply fails to take, no matter how long or what degree of effort a non-keyed creature puts in. An [identify](../../Magic/Spells/identify.md) spell will reveal the nature of the item as normal, but not its keyed nature; casting the [identify](../../Magic/Spells/identify.md) using a 2nd-level slot will reveal it is keyed, and higher-level slots will reveal greater details about the creature to whom the item is keyed: 3rd-level, the kind of creature, 4th-level, rough geographic (or planar) location relative to the item's current location, 5th-level, the creature's face or other semi-identifying characteristics, and finally with a 6th-level slot, the full details of the keyed creature.

Note that the binding is entirely one-way; a keyed item can only be bound to a single creature, but a creature could have up to three keyed items.

Many wizards will key their staves, and nobility often do so with their ruling artifacts; the Emperor of Liria, for example, is always keyed to the Sword of Liria (a *+3 sun blade*) so that only the Emperor can activate it, often as part of rituals and proclamations, and usually to verify the Emperor's identity.

## Sentient Items
Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.

Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.

Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the DM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.

### Abilities
A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.

### Communication
A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.

d100  | Communication
----- | -------------
01–60 | The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.
61–90 | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages.
91–00 | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it.

### Senses
With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table.

d4 | Senses
-- | ------
 1 | Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.
 2 | Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet
 3 | Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet.
 4 | Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.

### Alignment
A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table.

d100  | Alignment
----- | ---------
01–15 | Lawful good
16–35 | Neutral good
36–50 | Chaotic good
51–63 | Lawful neutral
64–73 | Neutral
74–85 | Chaotic neutral
86–89 | Lawful evil
90–96 | Neutral evil
97–00 | Chaotic evil

### Characteristics
Use the information on creating NPCs in chapter 4 to develop a sentient item’s mannerisms, personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. You can also draw on the “Special Features” section earlier in this chapter.

If you determine these characteristics randomly, ignore or adapt any result that doesn’t make sense for an inanimate object. You can reroll until you get a result you like.

### Special Purpose
You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following table.

d10 | Purpose
--- | -------
1 | *Aligned:* The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is never neutral.)
2 | *Bane:* The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls, or wizards.
3 | *Protector:* The item seeks to defend a particular race or kind of creature, such as elves or druids.
4 | *Crusader:* The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or destroy the servants of a particular deity.
5 | *Templar:* The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular deity.
6 | *Destroyer:* The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily.
7 | *Glory Seeker:* The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a famous or notorious figure.
8 | *Lore Seeker:* The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy.
9 | *Destiny Seeker:* The item is convinced that it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events.
10| *Creator Seeker:* The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created.

### Conflict
A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:

* The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.
* The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.
* The item demands that its wielder pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals.
* The item demands to be given to someone else.

If its wielder refuses to comply with the item’s wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:

* Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.
* Suppress one or more of its activated properties.
* Attempt to take control of its wielder.

If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is [charmed](../../Conditions/Charmed.md) by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn.

## Categories
I choose to use a system whereby effects can be paired with a variety of different containers; why should the properties of a *frost brand* be limited solely to swords?

Some items can only be a particular specific within the category--for example, an *animated shield* wouldn't make much sense as anything other than a shield, since an *animated breastplate* wouldn't yield any significant benefit (and possibly some drawbacks!).

## Buying magic items
Guideline: Most "common" items are going to price out at 250-500gp, depending on how directly useful they might be in combat, with combat items going for the higher end.

Magic items are priced typically in "tiers":

Tier | Price +/- Range
---- | ---------------
  1  | 50 +/- 15 gp
  2  | 100 +/- 20 gp
  3  | 500 +/- 100 gp
  4  | 1,000 +/- 200 gp
  5  | 2,500 +/- 500 gp
  6  | 5,000 +/- 1,000 gp
  7  | 10,000 +/- 2,000 gp
  8  | 25,000 +/- 5,000 gp
  9  | 50,000 +/- 10,000 gp
  10 | 100,000 +/- 25,000 gp
  11 | 250,000 +/- 50,000 gp
  12 | 500,000 +/- 100,000 gp
  13 | 1,000,000 +/- 250,000 gp
  14 | 2,500,000 +/- 500,000 gp

The rarity of an item sets its base tier: 

Rarity | Tier
------ | ----
common | 2
uncommon | 4
rare | 6
very rare | 8
legendary | 10

From there, a number of factors can affect the asking price:

* *Ammunition*, *Consumable*, and *Scrolls*: -1 tier
* If the item requires attunement: +1 tier
* *Weapons* and *defenses*: +1 tier
* If the purchase is happening in a village (population under 1,000): +2 tiers
* If the purchase is happening in a city (population over 10,000): -1 tier

No tier adjustment can ever drop below 1.

Examples: 

* potions of healing, climbing, : common (2), consumable (-1) = tier 1
* potions of supreme healing, invisibility, longevity: very rare (8), consumable (-1) = tier 7 (10,000gp)
* armor +1: rare (6), defense (+1) = tier 7 (10k)
* armor +2: very rare (8), defense (+1) = tier 9 (50k)
* armor +3: legendary (10) defense (+1) = tier 11 (250k)
* arrow +1: uncommon (4), ammunition (-1) = tier 3 (500gp)
* longbow +1: uncommon (4), weapon (+1) = tier 5 (2500gp)
* sword +1: uncommon (4), weapon (+1) = tier 5 (2500gp)

## Crafting magic items
*(adapted from the PHB and DMG)*

A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear. 

To create a magic item, four things are required:

* ***A "formula".*** The formula is like a recipe. It lists the materials needed and steps required to make the item.
* ***Skills.*** Certain skills are required to craft items of particular types, which are used to make proficiency checks during the crafting.
* ***Materials.*** Crafting a magic item will require raw materials.
* ***Time.*** It takes time to craft, though less if there are multiple individuals crafting.

**Formula.** If a crafter wants to craft an item, they require a detailed set of instructions to follow in order to be successful.

**Skills.** The skills and proficiencies required to craft an item can vary, but in general will follow the following table:

Item type | Proficiency
--------- | -----------
Non-metallic *defense* | Leatherworker's tools
Metallic *defense*, *weapon* | Smith's tools
*clothing*, *decoration* | Weaver's tools
*focus* | Jeweler's tools or Smith's tools or Woodworker's tools
*footwear* | Cobbler's tools
*instrument* | Musician's tools or Woodworker's tools or Smith's tools
*ornament* | Jeweler's tools
*potion* | Herbalism or Alchemist's supplies or Brewer's supplies
*readable*, *scroll* | Calligrapher's supplies
*stone* | Jeweler's tools or Mason's tools
*vessel* | Glassworker's tools or Smith's tools
any other wondrous item | DM's discretion

In the cases where multiple skills are listed, the crafter can create the item using any of the skills listed, but the "flavor" of the item should skew in that particular direction; for example, a *potion of healing* crafted using Brewer's supplies will take the form of a magical ale or beer, whereas an amulet *focus* crafted using Woodworker's tools will be a wooden disk worn using a leather loop, and so on. *Note that the Arcana proficiency can also be used in place of any of the above skills.*

Note that it is possible for a crafter to attempt to craft without the requisite proficiency, but will do so at disadvantage on the crafting roll.

**Materials.** The raw materials required will vary with the item, as per the DM's discretion, but in general will consist of the non-magical equivalent materials (so a sword or metallic armor will require some supply of steel, a bow would require some branch of wood, and so on) as well as particular component(s) that will lend to the item's magical nature. Typically an item will require one magical component per rarity level of the item above common--so an uncommon item will require one magical component, and a legendary one four (or more).

The cost of non-magical materials required (aside from the magical components) will be commensurate with the tier of the item, as given below:

Rarity | Cost
------ | ----
common | 50gp
uncommon | 200gp
rare | 2,000gp
very rare | 20,000gp
legendary | 100,000gp

A magical item invariably requires one or more exotic materials to complete it. These can range from the skin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool on the Elemental Plane of Water. Finding that material can take place as part of an adventure, or some mage schools partner with merchant guilds to provide these items for sale (DM's discretion). Magical components for the item will often need to come from mystical creatures or places, and will be relevant to the item's enchantments. A *ring of protection* may require threads of mithril and adamantine worked within it, or a *potion of climbing* requiring portions of the leg of a giant spider, and so on. At the DM's discretion, some may be able to be acquired via purchase, and if so, they will typically cost ten times the non-magical materials cost.

Crafting will also require some kind of space in which the crafting can take place--a shop, for example--which must be dedicated to the crafting of the item. The space will often need to have certain equipment within it, such as a forge, table, saws, and so on, for the creation of the item. Because most crafting efforts will require more than one day to carry out, the space must be dedicated to crafting and not "shared" with any other tasks--a crafter cannot craft in the common room of an inn, for example.

**Time.** Crafting an item will take time according to its rarity, below:

Rarity | Time
------ | ----
common | one day
uncommon | one week (7 days)
rare | one month (30 days)
very rare | one year (365 days)
legendary | one decade (3650 days)

Multiple crafters can combine on an item, reducing the time required. How many crafters can combine on an item depends on the size and complexity of the item (subject to the DM's discrtion), as given below:

Item type | Max crafters
--------- | ------------
*clothing* | 2
*decoration* | 2
*defense* | 4
*focus* | 3
*footwear* | 2
*instrument* | 2
*ornament* | 2
*potion* | 2
*scroll* | 2
*stones* | 3
*readable* | 4
*weapon* | 4
*vessel* | 2

The time to craft an item is divided by the number of crafters working on it, rounded up (so a 1 week item crafted by 2 crafters would require 4 days), but when the time comes for a proficiency check, all the crafters involved in the crafting must make the check.

**Proficiency Checks.** During the crafting, crafters must periodically make proficiency checks to see how the crafting is going. Each of the crafters involved in the crafting must make the check; the DC of the check depends on the rarity of the item being crafted (common, DC 10; uncommon, DC 12; rare, DC 15; very rare, DC 20; legendary, DC 25). If any of these checks fail, a "quirk" may develop in the item, the work may be delayed, or in the worst case, the work is ruined and must be started over. This proficiency check should be kept private to the DM. Failures can result in a quirk, collapse of the work, or sometimes by a strange quirk of fate, a bonus. An example of possibilities are given in the Crafting Fail Table:

**Crafting Fail Table**

 d20 | Result
 --- | ------
  1  | *Catastrophe.* Arcane forces collide, creating an explosion. The materials are lost, the shop must be rebuilt, and the crafters (and anyone else in or near the shop when it happens) suffer damage (common, 1d6; uncommon, 2d6; rare, 5d6; very rare, 10d6; legendary, 20d6) of a random type (d6: 1, force; 2, fire; 3, cold; 4, radiant; 5, necrotic; 6, poison).
 2-3 | *Collapse.* The arcana being invested into the item collapses and dissipates. The work is lost and must be restarted, though the materials remain.
 4-5 | *Messenger.* After 1d6 days with this item, the wielder slowly develops a tattoo all over their body over the course of 1d4 days that describes a fundamentally different tale of the creation of the world than they are familiar with.
 6-7 | *Empath.* The item blinks in and out of existence when the wielder feels strong emotions.
 8-9 | *Dirty.* This item never seems to be properly clean, no matter how often or how hard its owner cleans it.
10-11| *Occupied.* Regardless of what this item is, when it is held up to the ear, the sounds of a busy city can be heard.
12-13| *Musical.* Causes anything made of metal within 10' to vibrate at a low hum.
14-15| *Enlightening.* A dim light emits from under the wielders finger and toe nails.
16-17| *Tweaked.* When used, roll a d20; on a 20, a random cantrip goes off.
18-19| *Empowered.* Arcane forces collect, such that the item can cast a level 1d3 spell 1/day. This is unknown to the wielder even after inspection/ attunement.
  20 | *It's Alive!* A spirit is caught up in the arcane energies being harnessed into the item. When the work is complete, if it is not a consumable/one-shot item, it will be a [sentient magic item](#sentient-items). The sentience will not manifest until the work is fully complete, and if this effect happens two or more times, the item will have multiple personalities (with all the chaos and implications that suggests).

***Complications.*** Most of the complications involved in creating something, especially a magic item, are linked to the difficulty in finding rare ingredients or components needed to complete the work. The Crafting Complications table provides examples of what might happen.

**Crafting Complications Table**

d12 | Complication
--- | ------------
 1  | Rumors swirl that what you’re working on is unstable and a threat to the community. *If the mob storms the shop, uncompleted work must be restarted.*
 2  | Your tools are stolen, forcing you to buy new ones. *Uncompleted work is delayed until the tools are replaced.*

Most of these events demand role-playing solutions; players can attempt Charisma-based actions to try and defuse the situation, but over time could create poor relations with their neighbors. Note that crafters can also take positive steps to sway the locals, which can offer bonuses to the negotiations' die rolls.
