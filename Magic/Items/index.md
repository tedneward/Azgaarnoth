# Magical Items
I choose to use a system whereby effects can be paired with a variety of different containers; why should the properties of a *frost brand* be limited solely to swords?

Some items can only be a particular specific within the category--for example, an *animated shield* wouldn't make much sense as anything other than a shield, since an *animated breastplate* wouldn't yield any significant benefit (and possibly some drawbacks!).
