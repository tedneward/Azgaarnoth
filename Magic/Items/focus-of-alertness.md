# *Focus* of Alertness
*very rare (requires attunement)*

This *focus* has a flanged head and the following properties.

***Alertness.*** While holding the *focus*, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.

***Spells.*** While holding the *focus*, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, or see invisibility.

***Protective Aura.*** As an action, you can plant the haft end of the *focus* in the ground, whereupon the *focus*'s head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light. The *focus*'s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the *focus* from the ground. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
