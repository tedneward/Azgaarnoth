# *Wearable* of Speed
*Wondrous item*, *rare (requires attunement)*

While you wear this item, you can use a bonus action and engage the item (such as, for boots, you would click the bootsâ€™ heels together). If you do, you double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you engage the item again, you end the effect.

You can use the speed granted by this item for a total of 10 minutes (cumulative, across all uses), at which point the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.
