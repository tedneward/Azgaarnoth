# *Defense* of Glamour
*Defense, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this *defense*, you gain a +1 bonus to AC (beyond that of the defense itself). You can also use a bonus action to speak the *defense*'s command word and cause the *defense* to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of *defense*. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and accessories, but the *defense* retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the *defense*.

This is most often a suit of armor, though *glamoured* shields (made to look like bracelets or earrings) are popular. Typically, given that the bulk and weight are retained, these are most commonly light armor, such as leather or studded leather armor. Some bards prefer a *glamoured chain shirt*, made to look like ordinary clothes.
