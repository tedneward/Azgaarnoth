# *Defense* of Glamour
*Defense, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this *defense*, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also use a bonus action to speak the *defense*â€™s command word and cause the *defense* to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of *defense*. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and accessories, but the *defense* retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the *defense*.

This is most often a suit of armor.
