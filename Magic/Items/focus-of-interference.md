# *Focus* of Interference
*very rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard)*

This item has 6 charges. While holding the item, you can use an action to expend 1 of the itemâ€™s charges and make a ranged spell attack with an invisible ray of antimagic against a target within 60 feet. On a hit, any spell that is on the target ends, and if it is concentrating on a spell, that spell ends as well. In addition, the target you hit cannot cast spells again until the end of its next turn. The item regains 1d6 charges daily at dawn.
