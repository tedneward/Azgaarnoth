# Scroll
A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell's normal casting time. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll, lost, but with no other effect.

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

Spell Level | Rarity | Save DC | Attack Bonus
----------- | ------ | ------- | ------------
Cantrip | Common | 13 | +5
1st     | Common | 13 | +5
2nd     | Uncommon | 13 | +5
3rd     | Uncommon | 15 | +7
4th     | Rare | 15 | +7
5th     | Rare | 17 | +9
6th     | Very rare | 17 | +9
7th     | Very rare | 18 | +10
8th     | Very rare | 18 | +10
9th     | Legendary | 19 | +11

***Bard spells:*** Scrolls containing bardic spells can be studied and learned by bards. When a scroll is used to study a spell to learn it, the bard must succeed on a Charisma (Performance) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the bard has successfully learned the spell. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

***Cleric spells:*** Scrolls containing clerical prayers that are not known to the cleric can be studied, such that the cleric may prepare the spell in the future. The cleric must succeed on a Wisdom (Religion) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the cleric has successfully learned the prayer well enough to prepare it in the future. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

***Druidic spells:*** Scrolls containing druidic prayers that are not known to the druid can be studied, such that the druid may prepare the spell in the future. The druid must succeed on a Wisdom (Religion) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the druid has successfully learned the prayer well enough to prepare it in the future. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

***Pale Master spells:*** A pale master spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

***Shaman spells:*** Shaman spells cannot be captured on scrolls.

***Sorcerer spells:*** A sorcerer spell on a spell scroll can be learned by a sorcerer as one of their prepared spells. When a spell is studied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 12 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully learned. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

***Warlock spells:*** Pact Magic cannot be captured on scrolls.

***Wizard spells:*** A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.
