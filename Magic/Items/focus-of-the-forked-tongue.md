# *Focus* of the Forked Tongue
*uncommon, requires attunement by a Cleric, Druid, or Warlock*

You can use an action to speak this focus's command word and throw the focus on the ground within 10 feet of you. The focus becomes a [giant constrictor snake](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/giant-constrictor-snake) under your control and acts on its own initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the focus to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the snake.

On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you are able to concentrate. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its focus form. The focus then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to focus form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.
