# *Ammunition* of Slaying
*ammunition, very rare*

An *ammunition of slaying* is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both *ammunition of dragon slaying* and *ammunition of blue dragon slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an *ammunition of slaying* takes damage from the ammunition, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an *ammunition of slaying* deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes nonmagical ammunition.

Arrows are the most common form of this ammunition.
