# Celestial Coin

This coin bears a golden sun on one side, and a silver crescent moon on the other. You can use an action to flip the coin in the air. If it lands with the sun up, then the coin casts the spell [daylight](../Spells/daylight.md) upon itself. If it lands with the moon up, then it casts the spell [darkness](../Spells/darkness.md) upon itself. The coin can't be used this way again until after a short rest.
