# Weapon of Breath Absorption
*Weapon (any melee weapon), legendary*

This weapon has a [gem of breath absorption](gem-of-breath-absorption.md) worked into it. This gem functions as normal, with all of its associated powers. See [gem of breath absorption](gem-of-breath-absorption.md) for details.

While the gem is charged, instead of unleashing the breath weapon, you can use a bonus action to expend all of the gem's charged power to instead charge the weapon. For the next minute, or until you have hit 5 times with the weapon, whenever you hit a creature with this weapon, the weapon deals extra damage of the same type as the absorbed breath weapon. The amount of extra damage depends on the age of the dragon from which the breath weapon came, as given in the table below.
