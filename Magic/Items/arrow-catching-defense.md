# Arrow-Catching *Defense*
*Defense, rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wear this defense. This bonus is in addition to the defenseâ€™s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
