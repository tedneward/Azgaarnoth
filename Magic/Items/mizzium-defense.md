# Mizzium *defense*
*rare*

This metallic *defense* (which can be of any type that is primarily metallic) is reinforced with a magically enhanced metal alloy called mizzium. 

While you're wearing the *defense*, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. In addition, when you are subjected to a magical effect that allows you to make a Strength or Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw. (You still suffer full damage if you fail the saving throw.)
