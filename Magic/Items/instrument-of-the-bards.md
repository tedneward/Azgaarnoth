# Instrument of the Bards
*varies* *(requires attunement by a bard)*

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Many different types of these instruments exist, many of them named after a legendary bard college. Each instrument has a different set of spells the bard may cast through it as an action; once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

If you are casting a spell using your bardic spellcasting ability, and that spell would cause targets to save against charm, you can play the instrument while casting to impose disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

Each (known) instrument type and its spells are listed below:
