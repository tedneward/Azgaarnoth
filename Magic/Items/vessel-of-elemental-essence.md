# *Vessel* of Elemental Essence
*Wondrous item, rare*

While this vessel is activated (such as when incense is burning inside a censer of air essence), you can use an action to speak the censer’s command word and summon an elemental, as if you had cast the [conjure elemental](../Spells/conjure-elemental.md) spell. The *vessel* can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

Typically, a *vessel* like this maps its function to its form:

* Air: This 6-inch-wide, 1-foot-high vessel resembles a chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound, and conjures an [air elemental](../../Creatures/Extraplanar/Elementals.md#air-elemental).
* Earth: This stone weighs 5 pounds, and conjures [earth elemental](../../Creatures/Extraplanar/Elementals.md#earth-elemental).
* Fire: This brass brazier weighs 5 pounds, and conjures a [fire elemental](../../Creatures/Extraplanar/Elementals.md#fire-elemental).
* Water: This bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds, holds about 3 gallons, and conjures a [water elemental](../../Creatures/Extraplanar/Elementals.md#water-elemental)
* Ash/Smoke (air/fire): 
* Steam (fire/water): 
* Mud (earth/water): 
* Dust (air/earth): 
* Ice (air/water): 
* Magma (earth/fire):
