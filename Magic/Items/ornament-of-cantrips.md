# *Ornament* of Cantrips
*very rare (requires attunement by a non-spellcaster)*

This ornament allows the wearer to expend 1 of its charges and cast a cantrip. This item has 6 charges, and it regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

The *ornament*, when found, comes with three cantrips known to the *ornament*. Any spellcaster can cast a cantrip into the *ornament* to replace one of the existing three cantrips. The previous cantrip is lost unless replaced via the same process (having a spellcaster cast it into the *ornament*).

The save DC for any cantrip cast from this is 12, and the spell attack bonus is +4.
