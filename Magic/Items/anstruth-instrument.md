# Anstruth *Instrument*
*very rare (requires attunement by a bard)*

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells: [fly](../Spells/fly.md), [invisibility](../Spells/invisibility.md), [levitate](../Spells/levitate.md), [protection from evil and good](../Spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md), [control weather](../Spells/control-weather.md), [cure wounds](../Spells/cure-wounds.md) (5th level), [wall of thorns](../Spells/wall-of-thorns.md). Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it canâ€™t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.
