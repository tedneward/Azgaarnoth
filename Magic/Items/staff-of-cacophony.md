# Staff of Cacophony
*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard)*

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: [thunderwave](../Spells/thunderwave.md) (1 charge per level, up to 5 charges), [shatter](../Spells/shatter.md) (1 charge per level, up to 5 charges), [thunderlance](../Spells/thunderlance.md) (4 charges), or [thunderous reprisal](../Spells/thunderous-reprisal.md) (4 charges, cast at level 4).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
