# Quiver of Ehlonna
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Each of the quiverâ€™s three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard. When drawing from the *quiver*, the exact item desired can always be drawn. Drawing the item requires knowing what item to draw--if the creature attempting to draw an item out does not know what is stored, nothing is drawn. A *quiver* can be emptied as an action, at which point any and all objects stored clatter to the floor in a general heap.

Note that the *quiver* cannot store any item that is not of intent similar to the above listed items; its longest compartment can store shortbows or longbows, for example, but it cannot store a sword or an axe. Any item that cannot be stored in the quiver will fall out immediately, without being drawn.
