# *Focus* of Spheres
*rare*

While holding the item, you can use an action to expend one of the itemâ€™s charges and create a sphere of force that hovers 3 feet off the ground. The sphere can hold up to 200 pounds of items, and follows you around for up to 2 hours. The sphere is destroyed if it takes any damage, but any objects inside float to the ground as if affected by the [feather fall](/Magic/Spells/feather-fall.md) spell. You can create up to 3 spheres per day.
