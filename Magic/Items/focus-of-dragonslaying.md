# *Focus* of Dragonslaying
*very rare*

You can cast the following spells from the focus a number of times given by the number of charges, requiring no material components: earthbind (2 charges), bane (2 charges), bestow curse (1 charge), elemental bane (1 charge). Dragons make saving throws against spells cast from the focus with disadvantage.
