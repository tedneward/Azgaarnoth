# *Armor* of Fungal Spores
*uncommon*

While wearing this *Armor*, you can take a bonus action to make the *Armor* emit poisonous spores, which fill a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on yourself. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition until the end of your next turn. Once this property is used, it canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.

This *Armor* can be of any medium armor type.
