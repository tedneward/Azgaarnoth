# *Ornament* of Invisibility
*legendary (requires attunement)*

While wearing this, you can turn invisible as an action. Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you. You remain invisible until the *ornament* is removed, until you attack or cast a spell, or until you use a bonus action to become visible again.
