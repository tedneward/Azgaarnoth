# *Clothing/Defense/Ornament* of Charming
*rare (requires attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)*

While wearing this, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast [charm person](/Magic/Spells/charm-person.md), [command](/Magic/Spells/command.md), or [comprehend languages](/Magic/Spells/comprehend-languages.md) from it using your spell save DC.

If you are wearing this and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without this item's intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

This item regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the item grows dull and uninteresting and has no further magical properties.
