## Effects

### Anstruth *Instrument*
An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells: Fly, Invisibility, Levitate, Protection from Evil and Good, Control Weather, Cure Wounds (5th level), Wall of Thorns. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

### *Defense, Offense* of Gleaming
*common*

This item never gets dirty.

### *Clothing, Defense, Ornament* of Health
*rare*?

Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is already 19 or higher without it.

### *Clothing, Defense, Ornament* of Invulnerability
*legendary, requires attunement*

You have resistance to nonmagical damage while you wear this. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing this. Once this special action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### *Clothing, Defense, Ornament* of Proof against Detection and Location
*rare*?

While wearing this, you are hidden from divination magic. You can't be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

### *Clothing, Defense, Ornament* of the Planes
*legendary*

While wearing this, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the plane shift spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1–60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61–100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.

### *Clothing, Defense, Ornament* of Resistance
*rare, requires attunement*

You have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor. The DM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.

d10|Damage Type
---|---------
1|Acid
2|Cold
3|Fire
4|Force
5|Lightning
6|Necrotic
7|Poison
8|Psychic
9|Radiant
10|Thunder

### *Clothing, Defense, Ornament* of Vulnerability
*rare, requires attunement, cursed*

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.

**Curse**. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an [identify]() spell is cast on this or you attune to it. Attuning to this item curses you until you are targeted by the [remove curse]() spell or similar magic; removing the item fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the item (not the one to which it grants resistance).
