## Effects

### Alchemy *Container*
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This ceramic container appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the container when it is shaken, even if the container is empty.

You can use an action and name one liquid from the table below to cause the container to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the container as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the container can produce depends on the liquid you named.

Once the container starts producing a liquid, it can’t produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.

Liquid | Max Amount
------ | ----------
Acid | 8 ounces
Basic poison | 1/2 ounce
Beer | 4 gallons
Honey | 1 gallon
Mayonnaise | 2 gallons
Mead | 4 gallons
Oil	| 1 quart
Vinegar | 2 gallons
Water, fresh | 8 gallons
Water, salt | 12 gallons
Wine | 1 gallon

### Anstruth *Instrument*
*wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a bard)*

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells: [fly](/Magic/Spells/fly.md), [invisibility](/Magic/Spells/invisibility.md), [levitate](/Magic/Spells/levitate.md), [protection from evil and good](/Magic/Spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md), [control weather](/Magic/Spells/control-weather.md), [cure wounds](/Magic/Spells/cure-wounds.md) (5th level), [wall of thorns](/Magic/Spells/wall-of-thorns.md). Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

### *Defense* of Arrow-Catching
*rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this. (This bonus is in addition to any normal bonus to AC.) In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.

### *Offense* of Berserk Fury
*Melee wepaon, rare, requires attunement by barbarian*

In the hands of a non-barbarian, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 

In the hands of a barbarian, however, the weapon awakens to its full power. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.

**Curse**. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the weapon is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you (friend or foe) with the weapon. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random, though you may prioritize hostile creatures over friends and allies. 

You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear. If you have only non-hostile creatures within 60 feet of you, you may attempt to come out of the berserk state by making a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, but the DC modified by a +1 for each creature slain during your berserk state.

Close friends and allies may spend an action on their turn trying to "talk you down", and give you another saving throw attempt. The DM may give advantage or disadvantage on the roll depending on the nature of the relationship to you and the friend or ally trying to "talk you down".

### *Clothing/Defense/Ornament/Rock* of Breath Absorption
*Wondrous item, very rare*

This item is immune to damage from the breath weapons of all dragons. When it is exposed to the breath weapon of any true dragon, instead of taking damage, it absorbs the energy of the dragon's breath and stores it for later use. (This in no way affects the damage that other creatures take from the breath weapon, even the item's holder.) While the item is charged in this way, you can use an action to call forth the breath contained within. The item expends all of its power to unleash a breath weapon with the same size, shape, damage type, damage dice, and saving throw as the breath that it absorbed. Once used in this way, it cannot be charged again until the next dawn. The item can hold only one charge at a time.

Chromatic dragons will sometimes gift these as gems to their most prized followers as a token of power, and to help spread fear and carnage. The [Draconic Order](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md) appears to have a number of these items that they use during combat with the [Cult of the Wyrm](/Organizations/CultOfTheWyrm.md), though it is not clear if the Order knows how to create them, if they have a horde of them they safeguard, or if they are getting them from someplace else.

### *Ornament* of Cantrips
*very rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard)*

This ornament allows the wearer to expend 1 of its charges and cast any cantrip. This item has 6 charges, and it regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

### *Clothing/Defense/Ornament* of Charming
*rare (requires attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)*

While wearing this, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast [charm person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm-person), [command](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/command), or [comprehend languages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/comprehend-languages) from it using your spell save DC.

If you are wearing this and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without this item's intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

This item regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the item grows dull and uninteresting and has no further magical properties.

### *Ornament* of Counterspelling
*very rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard)*

You can cast a spell into this item. Afterwards, if someone casts the spell you cast into this item while they are within 60 feet of you, you can use a reaction to expend 1 of the item’s charges and cast [counterspell](/Magic/Spells/counterspell.md) as a 9th-level spell. This item has 6 charges, and it regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

### *Ammunition/Bead* of Force
*Wondrous item, rare*

Typically, these are found in groups of 1d4 + 4 items together.

You can use an action to throw the item up to 60 feet. It explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can.

An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

### *Defense/Offense* of Gleaming
*common*

This item never gets dirty.

### *Clothing/Defense/Ornament* of Health
*wondrous, requires attunement*

Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is already 19 or higher without it.

### *Clothing/Defense/Ornament* of Invulnerability
*legendary, requires attunement*

You have resistance to nonmagical damage while you wear this. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing this. Once this special action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

### Ioun *Rock*

### *Ammunition* of Mercy
*uncommon*

This is a blunted arrow/bolt whose head shatters on impact and delivers non-lethal subdual damage; if a creature is reduced to zero hit points, they immediately fall unconscious, but no death saves are required.

If a *merciful ammunition* is fired but does not score a hit, it may be recovered; once it hits, however, the head is shattered and cannot be reused unless recharged. Any mage capable of casting the *sleep* spell can recharge the ammunition by casting the spell directly on a (normal, nonmagical) reforged ammunition.

### *Clothing/Defense/Ornament* of Proof against Detection and Location
*wondrous item, requires attunement*

While wearing this, you are hidden from divination magic. You can't be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

### *Clothing/Defense/Ornament* of the Planes
*legendary*

While wearing this, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the plane shift spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1–60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61–100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.

### *Clothing/Defense/Ornament* of Resistance
*rare, requires attunement*

You have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor. The DM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.

d10|Damage Type
---|---------
1|Acid
2|Cold
3|Fire
4|Force
5|Lightning
6|Necrotic
7|Poison
8|Psychic
9|Radiant
10|Thunder

### *Ammunition* of Slaying
*very rare*

An *arrow of slaying* is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both *arrows of dragon slaying* and *arrows of blue dragon slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an *arrow of slaying* takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an *arrow of slaying* deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as *bolts of slaying* meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

### *Ornament* of Spell Storage
*rare, requires attunement*

This ornament stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 9 levels worth of any spells of any single spellcaster's type (bard, cleric, druid, paladin, ranger, sorceror, warlock, wizard) at a time. Note that the type is fixed to the item and does not change--a *ring of warlock spell storage* will always only store warlock spells, for example.

Any caster can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

### *Clothing/Defense/Ornament* of Vulnerability
*rare, requires attunement, cursed*

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.

**Curse**. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an [identify](/Magic/Spells/identify.md) spell is cast on this or you attune to it. Attuning to this item curses you until you are targeted by the [remove curse](/Magic/Spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic; removing the item fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the item (not the one to which it grants resistance).
