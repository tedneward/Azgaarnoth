# *Ornament* of Spell Storing
*rare (requires attunement)*

This *ornament* stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The *ornament* can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. If found, it often contains 1d6 - 1 levels of stored spells.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the *ornament* by touching the *ornament* as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the *ornament*. If the *ornament* canâ€™t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While wearing this *ornament*, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the *ornament* is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

There are several variations of this *ornament*: the "Lesser" version, which stores 3 levels of spells, and can cast spells of 1st through 3rd level, and is uncommon. The "Greater" version stores 9 levels, can cast spells of 1st through 7th level, and is very rare.
