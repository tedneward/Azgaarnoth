# *Ornament* of Storms
*very rare (requires attunement by an arcane caster)*

This item of jewelry (often an amulet) enables control over local weather patterns and the storms that arise from them.



**Curse**. While attuned to this item, the wearer will find all sorts of sea creatures drawn to them, usually with malevolent intentions. If the wearer is journeying over the any large body of water or within 50 miles of a coastline (whether fresh or saltwater), chances of an encounter are doubled, and the challenge rating of any encounter with maritime creatures is also doubled.
