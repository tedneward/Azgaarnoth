# Blood Leech *weapon*
*weapon*, *uncommon (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

If you make an attack using this weapon, and if you did not hit at least one target, at the end of your turn the blood leech weapon deals 5 (1d10) necrotic damage to you (this damage cannot be avoided and overcomes all immunities and resistances). Until the end of your next turn, the next attack you make deals an extra 2d6 points of necrotic damage to the first target it hits.
