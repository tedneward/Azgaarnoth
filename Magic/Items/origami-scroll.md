# Origami Scroll

You can use an action to read this scroll, which causes it to fold itself into an origami shape of one of several different types:

* **Origami food and a cup of water.** The food is bland but nourishing, enough to sustain you for 24 hours.
* **Paper weapon.** The weapon is magical for purposes of overcoming resistance but offers no bonus to hit or damage.
* **Paper shield.** The paper stiffens into a small buckler, which adds +1 to AC and weighs nothing. It does not suffer damage from attacks, despite being made of paper.

The origami can be returned to scroll form with a command word, or after 10 minutes have passed.

The scroll can be used once, after which it recharges at dawn.
