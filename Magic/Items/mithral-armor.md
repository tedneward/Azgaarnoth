# Mithral *Armor*
*uncommon*

Mithral is a light, flexible metal, and thus can be worn under normal clothes. Casual observers will not notice the armor if worn under clothes, and determined observers can only spot the armor on a Perception/DC15 check.

If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't. This armor also weighs one-tenth of the armor's non-mithral weight. It otherwise confers no additional benefits or bonus to AC.
