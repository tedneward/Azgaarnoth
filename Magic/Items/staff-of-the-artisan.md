# Staff of the Artisan
*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, sorcerer, or wizard)*

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: create item* (1 charge), stone shape (1 charge), animate objects (2 charges), fabricate (2 charges), or demiplane (10 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
