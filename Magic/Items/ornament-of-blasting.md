# *Ornament* of Blasting
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

While wearing this ornament, you can use an action to cast the [scorching ray](../Spells/scorching-ray.md) spell with it. When you make the spell’s attacks, you do so with an attack bonus of +5. The circlet can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
