# *Focus* of Absorption
*very rare (requires attunement)*

While holding this *focus*, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy--not the spell itself--is stored in the *focus*. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The *focus* can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the *focus* absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the *focus* can’t store, the *focus* has no effect on that spell.

This can only store actual spells cast, not effects produced by innate spellcasting or other sources. These effects must have come from spell slots--a mind flayer's psionics or a monk's ki cannot be stored.

When you become attuned to the *focus*, you know how many levels of energy the *focus* has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.

If you are a spellcaster holding the *focus*, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the *focus* as a 3rd-level spell slot.

A newly found *focus* has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A *focus* that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.
