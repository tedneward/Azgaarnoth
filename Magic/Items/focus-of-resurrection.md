# *Focus* of Resurrection
*legendary (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)*

The *focus* has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [heal](../Spells/heal.md) (expends 1 charge) or [resurrection](../Spells/resurrection.md) (expends 5 charges).

The *focus* regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If the *focus* is reduced to 0 charges, roll a d20. On a 1, the *focus* disappears in a burst of radiance.
