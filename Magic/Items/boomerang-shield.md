# Boomerang *Shield*
*uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

You can make a ranged weapon attack with this magic shield. It has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet, and it uses your Strength or Dexterity for the attack roll (your choice). If youâ€™re proficient with shields, you are proficient with attacks made using this shield. On a hit, it deals slashing damage; 1d4 if this is a buckler, 1d6 if it is a normal shield, or 1d8 if this is a tower shield. If you throw the shield, it reappears in your hand the instant after it hits or misses a target.

This shield is usually made of metal, and weighs next to nothing.
