# Hunter's Leather (Armor)
*very rare* *(requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this leather armor (for a total AC of 12, before any other modifiers).

The armor has 3 charges. When you hit a creature with an attack and that creature doesn't have all its hit points, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d10 necrotic damage to the target. The armor regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
