# *Focus* of Rulership
*rare (requires attunement)*

You can use an action to present the *focus* and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The *focus* can’t be used again until the next dawn.
