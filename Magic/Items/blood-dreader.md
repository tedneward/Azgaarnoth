# Blood-Dreader *weapon*
*weapon (any sword)*, *rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon against nonliving creatures. Otherwise, it functions as a normal sword.

**Curse.** When you deal damage to a living creature with this blade, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you feint and fall unconscious. You can repeat the saving throw at the end of each turn, ending the effect with a success.

You can break the cursed enchantment as normal. Afterward, the sword becomes a +1 weapon with no other properties.
