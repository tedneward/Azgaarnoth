# *Decoration* of Invocation
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This *decoration* (most often a slender taper, a candle) is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity’s alignment. The *decoration*’s alignment can be detected with the [detect evil and good](../Spells/detect-evil-and-good.md) spell. The DM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.

d20 | Alignment
--- | ----------------
1–2	| Chaotic evil
3–4	| Chaotic neutral
5–7	| Chaotic good
8–9	| Neutral evil
10–11 | Neutral
12–13 | Neutral good
14–15 | Lawful evil
16–17 | Lawful neutral
18–20 | Lawful good

When the *decoration*’s magic is activated (such as when the candle is lit, or the banner is unfurled, or the mirror has the command word or phrase spoken to it, and so on), which requires an action, it sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the *decoration* makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, any divine caster (cleric, druid, paladin, etc) in the light whose alignment matches the *decoration*’s can cast 1st-level spells they have prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell’s effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.

Alternatively, when you activate the *decoration* for the first time, you can cast the [gate](../Spells/gate.md) spell with it. Doing so destroys the *decoration* if it can be consumed (such as a candle) or is unable to function for one week.
