# *focus* of the Devout
*Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)*

This *focus* (typically an amulet) bears the symbol of a deity inlaid with precious stones or metals. While you wear or hold the holy symbol, you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your spells. The bonus is determined by the amulet's rarity, and will only attune to clerics or paladins who worship that deity.

While you wear or hold this, you can use your Channel Divinity feature without expending one of the feature's uses. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
