# *Focus* of Lordly Might
*legendary (requires attunement)*

This *focus* has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic weapon (mace if a rod, quarterstaff if a staff, or dagger if a wand) that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The *focus* has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.

***Six Buttons.*** You can press one of the *focus*’s six buttons as a bonus action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the *focus* to revert to its normal form.

If you press button 1, the *focus* becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the *focus*’s flanged head (you choose the type of sword).

If you press button 2, the *focus*’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the *focus* into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

If you press button 3, the *focus*’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the *focus*’s tip, and the *focus*’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the *focus* into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

If you press button 4, the *focus* transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the *focus* to revert to its normal form.

If you press button 5, the *focus* transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.

If you press button 6, the *focus* assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the *focus* is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The *focus* also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.

***Drain Life.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the *focus*, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

***Paralyze.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the *focus*, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

***Terrify.*** While holding the *focus*, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
