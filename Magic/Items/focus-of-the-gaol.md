# *Focus* of the Gaol
*very rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard)*

This focus has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: [hold person](../Spells/hold-person.md) (1 charge, cast at level 2), [hold monster](../Spells/hold-monster.md) (2 charges, cast at level 5), [maze](../Spells/maze.md) (5 charges), or [imprisonment](../Spells/imprisonment.md) (10 charges).

The focus regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the focus blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
