# *focus* of Dragon Power
*legendary*

This focus has 11 charges. You can expend charges to cast the following spells from the focus, requiring no material components: dragon's breath (2 charges), fly (5 charges), or protection from energy (2 charges). You can expend extra charges on a spell, increasing its level by one for every extra charge you spend, if the spell has additional effects at higher levels.

Alternatively, you can expend 7 charges to gain draconic might. For the next minute, your Strength and Charisma scores each become 24, unless they are already higher, and dragon scales manifest across your body, giving you a +4 bonus to your AC. If you are wearing armor, you do not gain this bonus to your AC.

The focus regains 1d10 charges daily at dawn.
