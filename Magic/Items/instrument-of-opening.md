# *Instrument* of Opening
*wondrous item, rare*

When you play this instrument as an action, you point it at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The *instrument* issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the sound canâ€™t reach the object. If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens.
