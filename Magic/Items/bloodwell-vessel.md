# Bloodwell *vessel*
*Wondrous item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a sorcerer)*

To attune to this *vessel* (often a vial, for easier transportation and hiding), you must place a few drops of your blood into it. The vial can't be opened while your attunement to it lasts. If your attunement to the vial ends, the contained blood turns to ash. You can use the vial as a spellcasting focus for your spells while wearing or holding it, and you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your sorcerer spells. The bonus is determined by the vial's rarity.

In addition, when you roll any Hit Dice to recover hit points while you are carrying the vial, you can regain 5 sorcery points. This property of the vial can't be used again until the next dawn.

If the attuned sorcerer is a Blood Sorcerer, the *vessel* holds 3 (uncommon), 4 (rare) or 5 (very rare) blood points, and recharges 1d4 blood points at dusk. Spells that are *blood*-tagged gain an additional +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and saving throw DCs.

Note that when used, the Bloodwell *vessel* glows with a distinctive deep crimson-burgundy color, and if visible, is easily noticed by onlookers. The sight of such items is often enough to institute a panic among those who have heard the legends of the Bloodmancers.

Rumors persist of larger vessels that provide even greater power to a Bloodmancer.
