# Bracers of Charming
*Staff, rare (requires attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)*

While wearing these decorative and tasteful bracers, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast [charm person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/charm-person), [command](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/command), or [comprehend languages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/comprehend-languages) from it using your spell save DC.

If you are wearing the bracers and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the bracers again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the bracers' intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the bracers and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

The bracers regain 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the bracers turn a dull brass color and have no further magical properties.
