# *ranged weapon* of Conflagration
*Weapon (any ranged weapon), rare (requires attunement)*

Ammunition fired from this *weapon* blazes brightly. When you hit with an attack roll using this *weapon*, the target takes an extra 1d10 fire damage. If the target is a flammable, nonmagical object, it is set [ablaze](../../Conditions/Ablaze.md), taking 1d10 damage at the start of its turn until it extinguishes the flames.
