# *Focus* of the Pact Keeper
*uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) (requires attunement by a warlock)*

While holding this *focus*, you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your warlock spells. The bonus is determined by the *focus*'s rarity.

In addition, you can regain one warlock spell slot as an action while holding the *focus*. You can't use this property again until you finish a long rest.
