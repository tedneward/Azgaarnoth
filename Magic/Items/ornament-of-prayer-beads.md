# *Ornament* of Prayer Beads
*rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)*

This ornament (most often a necklace or bracelet, but other ornaments have been forged, such as torques or tiaras) has 1d4 + 2 magic beads (or prominent stones) that display prominently in the ornament. While wearing the ornament, using a bonus action, the attuned wearer can stroke one of these beads or stones to call forth a magical effect (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). The attuned wearer is aware of all beads/stones on the ornament and their charged/used status; once a bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.

If a magic bead or stone is removed from the ornament, that bead loses its magic.

Many forms of beads exist; their most common materials and their chances of appearing randomly are given in parentheses after the name. These are arranged in order of commonality.

**Blessing.** (aquamarine, 6 in 20) The attuned wearer can cast [bless](../Spells/bless.md) as a 1st-level spell.

**Wounding.** (fire opal, 6 in 20) The attuned wearer can cast [inflict wounds](../Spells/inflict-wounds.md) as a 2nd-level spell.

**Infamy.** (black opal, 6 in 20) The attuned wearer can cast [inspire dread](../Spells/inspire-dread.md) as a 2nd-level spell.

**Curing.** (topaz, 6 in 20) The attuned wearer can cast either [cure wounds](../Spells/cure-wounds.md) as a 2nd-level spell, or [lesser restoration](../Spells/lesser-restoration.md).

**Favor.** (coral, 4 in 20) The attuned wearer can cast [greater restoration](../Spells/greater-restoration.md).

**Smiting.** (bloodstone, 2 in 20) The attuned wearer can cast [branding smite](../Spells/branding-smite.md).

**Sanction.** (quartz, 2 in 20) The attuned wearer can cast [zealous sanction](../Spells/zealous-sanction.md).

**Resolve.** (jade, 1 in 20) The attuned wearer can cast [marshal's resolve](../Spells/marshals-resolve.md).

**Grave.** (garnet, 1 in 20) The attuned wearer can cast [create undead](../Spells/create-undead.md).

Note that each use of a bead draws the attention of the attuned wearer's diety, so each use of the bead should be in direct support of that diety's aims or goals; too many uses not directly supporting the diety's agenda could result in divine warnings or, in the most extreme cases, censure.
