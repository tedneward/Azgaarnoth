# *footwear* of Speed
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While you wear these, you can use a bonus action and click the heels together. If you do, they double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When the this property has been used for a total of 10 minutes (across multiple on-off cycles), the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.
