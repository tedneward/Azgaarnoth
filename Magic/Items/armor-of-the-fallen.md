# *Armor* of the Fallen
*uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

This *armor* can be of any medium or heavy type, and will often be a jet-black color with a faint scent of attar to it.

While wearing this *armor*, you can use it to cast either [Speak With Dead](../Spells/speak-with-dead.md) or [Animate Dead](../Spells/animate-dead.md). Once the *armor* has cast a spell in this way, it canâ€™t cast either spell until the next dawn.

Your soul keeps this *armor* together. If you die while you are attuned to the *armor*, the *armor* is destroyed.
