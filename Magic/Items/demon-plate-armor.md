# Demon Plate Armor
*very rare* *(requires attunement)*

This full plate armor is always jet black, with blood-red coloration inlaid into the otherwise plain appearance. Anyone standing in a very quiet room where this armor is present can hear the faintest of screams and shrieks, as if from a great distance.

This armor does not require proficiency to be able to wear and use, and while worn, it feels weightless and has no Dexterity penalty, either to Stealth or max Dexterity bonus. 

While wearing this armor:

* you gain a +1 bonus to AC
* you can understand and speak Abyssal
* the armor's clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.

***Curse.*** Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the [Remove Curse](../Spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
