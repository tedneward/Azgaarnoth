# *defense* of Balance
*rare (requires attunement)*

Most often, this item is a burnished copper breastplate that looks as if it were made of interlocking gears. Merchant's scales are emblazoned across the chest.

The *defense* has 4 charges. You can use the charges in the following ways while wearing the *defense*:

***Equalize.*** When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can expend 1 charge and take a reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.

***Expunge Imbalance.*** As a bonus action, you can expend 2 charges to cast [lesser restoration](../Spells/lesser-restoration.md).

The *defense* regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.
