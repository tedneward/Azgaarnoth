# Sanguine *sword*
*Weapon (any sword)*, *rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon against living creatures. Otherwise, it functions as a normal sword.

**Curse.** This is a cursed sword and once drawn, it will not allow you (the wielder) to sheathe the blade until it spills blood; you may make a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw, but on a failure you will not want to sheathe the blade, and even if forced to do so, others will find that your hand is arcanely bound to the hilt and unable to let go. Success on the saving throw will only mean that you can sheathe the blade--you will still resist any and all attempts to take the blade from your person.

When you deal damage to a living creature with the blade, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or continue to attack until you or the creature drops to 0 hit points, or you are unable to reach the creature to make a melee attack against it.

While unsheathed, the wielder cannot benefit from a long or short rest.

You can release the sword of its curse as normal. Afterward, the sword becomes a +1 weapon with no other properties.
