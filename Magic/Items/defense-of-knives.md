# *Defense* of Throwing Knives
*Defense, rare*

This *defense* will have what appear to be six daggers or knives easily accessible while using it--on bracers or gauntlets, three knives will be on each hand, while on shields or armor, the knives will be in easy-to-reach places that do not compromise the item's defensive ability.

The *defense* itself is not magical, offering no bonus to Armor Class, but the knives are perfectly balanced for throwing (+1 magical daggers), and any knife thrown returns at the end of the round to the sheath from which it was pulled, regardless of whether it hit its target or missed. These weapons will always return, regardless of what happens to the knife. (In essence, the *defense* evokes new knives into place.)
