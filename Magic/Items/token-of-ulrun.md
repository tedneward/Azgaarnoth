# Token of Ulrun Anyuthvar
*(jewelry/necklace, unique)*

This emerald gem in a simple silver setting on a thin necklace is the token of favor of Ulrun Anyuthvar, the Guardian of Heathwyck.

While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.

In addition, if anywhere on your person (not necessarily visible), you will gain favorable treatment at any Night's Blessing tower or with any Night's Blessing member, as well as with any temple or clergy of Wee Jas.
