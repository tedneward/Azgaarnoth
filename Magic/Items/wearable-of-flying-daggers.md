# *wearable* of Flying Daggers
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This item of clothing (armband, cloak, robe, boots, even a hat once) appears to have thin daggers strapped to it. As an action, you can pull up to two magic daggers from the *wearable* and immediately hurl them, making a ranged attack with each dagger. A dagger vanishes if you don't hurl it right away, and the daggers disappear right after they hit or miss. The *wearable* never runs out of daggers.
