# *(Container)* of silverblack
*(wondrous item, rare)* 

A silvery liquid with a faint odor of iron to it. If applied to a non-magical weapon by a blacksmith, it will make that weapon a *silvered* weapon permanently. Knowledge of how to create silverblack is quite rare, and most smiths would be willing to pay north of 500gp for a vial.

A vial holds one application.
