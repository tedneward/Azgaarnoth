# *Clothing* of Elvenkind
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Elvish-made clothing, made in the "old style", provide various advantages on stealth.

* Boots: While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.
* Cloak/Mantle/Robe: While you wear this with its hood up, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, as the clothingâ€™s color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
* Gloves: While you wear these gloves, actions by your hands make no sound, regardless of what they are doing. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and anyone attempting to notice these attempts are at disadvantage.
* Hat: While you wear this hat, your face seems to always be in shadow, and difficult to perceive. You have advantage on Disguise
* Horseshoes: While the horse wears these horseshoes, its steps make no sound, regardless of the surface it is currently traversing or the speed at which it is moving. While mounted, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.
