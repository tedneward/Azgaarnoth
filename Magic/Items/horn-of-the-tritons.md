# Horn of the Tritons
*instrument, rare*

The horn of the tritons is a magical conch shell horn that, when blown, can calm troubled waters, banish water elementals, summon sharks, or inflict fear upon aquatic beasts. It also calls the attention of all tritons within three miles. Its magic can be used once per day, except by tritons, who can use it three times per day.

This instrument is always a horn of some form.
