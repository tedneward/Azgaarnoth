# Scorpion *armor*
*rare* *(requires attunement)*

This suit of plate armor is fashioned from giant scorpion chitin. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:

* The *armor* improves your combat readiness, granting you a +5 bonus to initiative as long as you aren't incapacitated.
* The *armor* doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
* The *armor* doesn't impose disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of [extreme heat](../../Conditions/index.md).

***Curse.*** This armor is cursed. Whenever you don or doff it, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 100 (10d10 + 45) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only a [Wish](../Spells/wish.md) spell can remove the armor's curse.
