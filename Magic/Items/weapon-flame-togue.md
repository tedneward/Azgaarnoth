# *Weapon* Flame Tongue
*Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)*

You can use a bonus action to speak this magic *weapon*'s command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the *weapon* is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe (or otherwise un-ready) the *weapon*.
