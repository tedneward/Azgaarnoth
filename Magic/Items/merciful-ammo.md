# Merciful Ammo
*Ammunition, uncommon*

A *merciful* ammunition is blunted, shattering on impact and delivering non-lethal subdual damage; if a creature is reduced to zero hit points, they immediately fall unconscious, but no death saves are required.

If a *merciful* ammunition is fired but does not score a hit, it may be recovered; once it hits, however, it is shattered and cannot be reused unless recharged. Any mage capable of casting the *sleep* spell can recharge the item by casting the spell directly on a (normal, nonmagical) reforged ammunition element.
