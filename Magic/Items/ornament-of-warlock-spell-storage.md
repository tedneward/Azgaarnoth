# *Ornament* of Warlock Spell Storage
*rare (requires attunement)*

This ornament (typically a ring) stores warlock spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. It can store up to 9 levels worth of spells at a time.

Any warlock can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the ornament by touching the ornament as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ornament. If the ornament can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.

While wearing this, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ornament is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.
