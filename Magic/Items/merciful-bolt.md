# Merciful Bolt
*Crossbow bolt, uncommon*

A *merciful bolt* is a blunted bolt whose head shatters on impact and delivers non-lethal subdual damage; if a creature is reduced to zero hit points, they immediately fall unconscious, but no death saves are required.

If a *merciful bolt* is fired but does not score a hit, it may be recovered; once it hits, however, the head is shattered and cannot be reused unless recharged. Any mage capable of casting the *sleep* spell can recharge the bolt by casting the spell directly on a (normal, nonmagical) reforged crossbow bolt head affixed to the bolt.
