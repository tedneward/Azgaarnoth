# Corrosive Metabolism
*Immortal Discipline*

Your control over your body allows you to deliver acid or poison attacks.

***Psychic Focus***. While focused on this discipline, you have resistance to acid and poison damage.

***Corrosive Touch (1–7 psi)***. As an action, you deliver a touch of acid to one creature within your reach. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 acid damage per psi point spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Venom Strike (1–7 psi)***. As an action, you create a poison spray that targets one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 poison damage per psi point spent and is poisoned until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

***Acid Spray (2 psi)***. As a reaction when you take piercing or slashing damage, you cause acid to spray from your wound; each creature within 5 feet of you takes 2d6 acid damage.

***Breath of the Black Dragon (5 psi)***. You exhale a wave of acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. You can increase the damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on it.

***Breath of the Green Dragon (7 psi)***. You exhale a cloud of poison in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
