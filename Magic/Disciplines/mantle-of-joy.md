# Mantle of Joy
*Avatar Discipline*

You tap into the joy within you, radiating it outward in soothing, psychic energy that brings hope and comfort to creatures around you.

***Psychic Focus.*** While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks.

***Soothing Presence (1–7 psi).*** As a bonus action, choose up to three creatures you can see within 60 feet of you. Each target gains 3 temporary hit points per psi point spent on this effect.

***Comforting Aura (2 psi; conc., 1 min.).*** As a bonus action, choose up to three allies you can see (you can choose yourself in place of one of the allies). Until your concentration ends, each target can roll a d4 when making a saving throw and add the number rolled to the total.

***Aura of Jubilation (3 psi; conc., 1 min.).*** As a bonus action, you radiate a distracting mirth until your concentration ends. Each creature within 60 feet of you that can see you suffers disadvantage on any checks using the Perception and Investigation skills.

***Beacon of Recovery (5 psi).*** As a bonus action, you and up to five allies you can see within 60 feet of you can immediately make saving throws against every effect they’re suffering that allows a save at the start or end of their turns.
