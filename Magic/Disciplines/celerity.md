You channel psionic power into your body, honing your reflexes and agility to an incredible degree. The world seems to slow down while you continue to move as normal.

***Psychic Focus.*** While focused on this discipline, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

***Rapid Step (1–7 psi).*** As a bonus action, you increase your walking speed by 10 feet per psi point spent until the end of the current turn. If you have a climbing or swimming speed, this increase applies to that speed as well.

***Blur of Motion (2 psi).*** As an action, you cause yourself to be invisible during any of your movement during the current turn.
