# Diminution
*Immortal Discipline*

You manipulate the matter that composes your body, drastically reducing your size without surrendering any of your might.

***Psychic Focus.*** While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

***Miniature Form (2 psi; conc., 10 min.).*** As a bonus action, you become Tiny until your concentration ends. While this size, you gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can move through gaps up to 6 inches across without squeezing.

***Toppling Shift (2 psi).*** As a bonus action, you shift to an incredibly small size and then suddenly return to normal, sending an opponent flying backward. Choose one creature you can see within 5 feet of you. It must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Sudden Shift (5 psi).*** As a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you shift down to minute size to avoid the attack. The attack misses, and you move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks before returning to normal size.

***Microscopic Form (7 psi; conc., 10 min.).*** As a bonus action, you become smaller than Tiny until your concentration ends. While this size, you gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and a +5 bonus to AC, you can move through gaps up to 1 inch across without squeezing, and you canâ€™t make weapon attacks.
