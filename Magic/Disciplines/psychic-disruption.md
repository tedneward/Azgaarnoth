# Psychic Disruption
*Awakened Discipline*

You create psychic static that disrupts other creatures’ ability to think clearly.

***Psychic Focus***. While focused on this discipline, you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks.

***Distracting Haze (1–7 psi; conc., 1 min.)***. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d10 psychic damage per psi point spent and can’t see anything more than 10 feet from it until your concentration ends. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

***Daze (3 psi)***. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is incapacitated until the end of your next turn or until it takes any damage.

***Mind Storm (5 psi)***. As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 6d8 psychic damage and suffers disadvantage on all saving throws until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. You can increase the damage by 1d6 per additional psi point spent on this ability.
