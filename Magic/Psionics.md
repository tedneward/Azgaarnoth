# Psionics
Psionic powers arenâ€™t the domain of any particular class but were available for characters of different types to experience. Psionics use the power of the user, rather than channeling energy from the surrounding fabric of the arcane (wizards) or from divine sources (clerics). This internal power can be vast, and once tapped, used to cast a variety of spells and effects.

## Psionic Talent Die
Several psionic-related feats and spells speak of a "psionic talent die"; this is a die that is used for feats or class options, and represents the ability to tap into psionic power. Any use of a psionic power taps into this die, and various effects can "change the die", meaning change its type, from a d6 to a d4, or from a d4 to a d6 to a d8, and so on.
