# Psionics
Psionic powers aren’t the domain of any particular class but were available for characters of different types to experience. Psionics use the power of the user, rather than channeling energy from the surrounding fabric of the arcane (wizards) or from divine sources (clerics). This internal power can be vast, and once tapped, used to cast a variety of spells and effects.

## Psionic, arcane, and divine
How does psionic power interact with the arcane and the divine? All three are a form of "power", in that "power" is used to accomplish some effects that are not natural to the world (such as flight, fireballs, or illusion). However, each is a different and separate source of those effects. "Power", as used here, can be considered to be synonymous with "magic" (such as for the description of the [antimagic field](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field) spell), but "psionics" are a different category than "arcane" or "divine", and thus effects which affect "arcane" do not affect "psionic" (or "divine", for that matter).

> *From the UA Psionic Options article:* Psi is a supernatural power that emanates from the mind. Like other forms of supernatural power in D&D, it can be used to create magical phenomena, yet it can create other sorts of phenomena as well. In the game’s rules, only certain supernatural effects are classified as magical: magic items, spells, spell attacks, powers fueled by spell slots, and any other effect that the rules explicitly call magical. This distinction is rarely relevant in play, typically coming up only when something like an antimagic field shows up.
> From a storytelling standpoint, some supernatural effects in D&D weave their power into a formalized form—a spell, for instance—that other effects can disrupt. In contrast, there are other supernatural effects that are so wild, formless, or subtle that it is difficult or impossible to disrupt them. In this article, some of the psionic powers create what the rules consider to be magic and some don’t.

## Psionic Talent Die
Several psionic-related feats and spells speak of a "psionic talent die"; this is a die that is used for feats or class options, and represents the ability to tap into psionic power. Any use of a psionic power taps into this die, and various effects can "change the die", meaning change its type, from a d6 to a d4, or from a d4 to a d6 to a d8, and so on.
