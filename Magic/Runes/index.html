<h1 id="runes">Runes</h1>
<p>It is thought that runes are <a href="../History/Eldar.md">Eldar</a> magic, or perhaps the expression of magic that the Eldar perfected, or was their most powerful expression of magic (depending on which scholars are speaking on the subject). While mortals' understanding of runes is quite limited--and some scholars believe that runes only truly attained their full power when scribed by the Eldar--many scholars and magi continue to pursue the study of runes, seeking that breakthrough that will unlock the Eldars' power. Runic knowledge is rare in Azgaarnoth, but frequent enough that only the most uninformed don't understand at least the legends of the runes. Some shysters and con artists have sold sparkly mysterious writing as "runes" to the gullible, as a result, but some of the most ancient places in Azgaarnoth still have shimmering runes enscribed (such as the walls of <a href="../Cities/Flakew.md">Flakew</a>), and stories of master runes being discovered in various places only add to the allure and attraction.</p>
<p>Runes are openly studied at the tiny but well-funded <a href="../Organizations/MageSchools/SchoolOfTheEldar.md">School of the Eldar</a>. They are constantly on the hunt for new runes or new application of existing runes, and frequently journey to the corners of Azgaarnoth in the company of paid mercenaries/adventurers to conduct their research. </p>
<p>For whatever reason, runes seem to run very closely to the races of giants found with Azgaarnoth; master runes are often found in giantish possession or treasure hoards, or near giant steadings, and so on. Whether this indicates a tie between the giants and the Eldar is subject to great speculation among the few rune scholars alive. </p>
<p>Rune magic allows a character to unlock the power contained within magical symbols and sigils. Not every such mark has power within it, however; the power lies not in the calligraphy, but in the ability to import the fundamental magic of creation into the script. <a href="../Classes/Prestige/RuneScribe.md">Rune Scribes</a> learn how to scribe them and call forth their deeper powers, <a href="../Classes/Fighter/RuneKnight.md">Rune Knights</a> learn how to apply a rune to an item, and <a href="../Classes/Prestige/GlyphCaster.md">Glyph Casters</a> have learned "lesser runes", called glyphs, which are "smaller" magical effects captured in written form.</p>
<h2 id="rune-magic">Rune Magic</h2>
<p>Runes are always enscribed on something, but some runes are enscribed on tablets or surfaces meant for direct use, rather than to enhance the powers of the item or surface upon which they are enscribed. These are called <strong>master runes</strong>, and although they often give off strong feelings of magic, they often are incomprehensible to the uninitiated, because they do not release their effects with a simple command word--their power is only for those who take the time to understand the rune. Not just the calligraphy of the rune, but the sense of how power is released into the rune, stored within the rune, captured, and so on.</p>
<p>A master rune is a rare object--a gem or carved rock, a magical token, a shard of some special material, and so on--engraved with the rune and empowered with magic that allows you to unleash the rune’s effects. Those effects are divided into two categories.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple properties</strong> are usable by anyone who attunes to a master rune.</li>
<li><strong>Complex properties</strong> are usable only by a character who attunes to a master rune and who possesses the Rune Lore feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, you must have a master rune on your person in order to use its properties.</p>

<p>In the days of the Eldar, it was not uncommon for the Eldar to combine runes to create powerful combinatorial effects (for example, the walls of Flakew still blaze with runes that appear to be a combination of the runes <em>thurisaz</em> and <em>othala</em>, and have never needed a moment of maintenance in recorded history despite numerous attempts to fell them or topple them), but such skill is lost to the world today.</p>
<p>Only a few of these runes have survived into the modern day as master runes, though rune scribes, rune knights, scholars, and others constantly scour the world for more.</p>
<h3 id="finding-runes">Finding Runes</h3>
<p>A master rune found as treasure is always a master rune, carefully scribed into a rare object and available for use as a training tool to allow would-be rune scribes to unlock its power. Master runes and the runes they contain are treated much like magic items. They are categorized in rarity from rare to legendary, and can be placed in a campaign whenever the DM opts to place treasure. There are no common or uncommon runes.</p>
<h3 id="buying-and-selling-runes">Buying and Selling Runes</h3>
<p>Treat a master rune as a magic item of its equivalent rarity for the purpose of buying and selling in the campaign. Just as with other magic items, the DM will determine whether such items are available to purchase in the campaign and under what conditions.</p>
<h3 id="identifying-runes">Identifying Runes</h3>
<p>Master runes are identified in a manner similar to magic items. Simply handling a master rune causes a strong sense of its rune’s identity to echo in a character’s mind. For example, touching a master rune item containing the <em>isa</em> rune (the rune of Ice) might cause you to experience a sudden chill as visions of snow and ice flash through your mind.</p>
<p>The <a href="Spells/identify.md">identify</a> spell immediately reveals a master rune’s simple properties. You can also learn its simple properties over the course of a short rest while maintaining physical contact with the rune.</p>
<h3 id="master-runes-and-attunement">Master Runes and Attunement</h3>
<p>A master rune always requires attunement to use its simple properties. Attuning to a master rune requires you to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it. This can’t be the same short rest used to learn the rune’s properties. This focus takes the form of carefully and repeatedly copying the rune, whether with ink and parchment or simply scribing it into the dirt. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, you gain an intuitive understanding of how to activate the master rune’s magical properties.</p>
<p>A master rune can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and all runes count toward your limit of magic items you can attune to. Any attempt to attune to a fourth magic item or rune fails. You cannot attune to more than one copy of a rune.You can end attunement to a rune in the same manner as with any other magic item.</p>
<p>Simple properties of a master rune are generally cantrip/1st-level/2nd-level effects.</p>
<p>Complex properties often allow for the inscription of the rune upon other items for temporary purposes, or offer 3rd-/4th-/5th-level effects.</p></div>
