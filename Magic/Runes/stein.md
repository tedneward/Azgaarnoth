## Stein
*Stability, Wisdom, Understanding, Patience*

### Simple Properties
**Indomitable Stand.** As an action, you scribe the *stein* rune onto the ground at your feet. Until you move, you have advantage on all ability checks and saving throws to resist effects that would force you to move. In addition, any creature that moves within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or have its movement immediately end.

**Stone Soul.** While you are attuned to this rune, you cannot be petrified.

**Stone’s Secrets.** As an action, you scribe this rune onto a stone wall or floor. You learn the location and size of all creatures standing on or touching that surface within 30 feet of you, though only for the moment when the property is used.

### Complex Properties
**Crushing Brand.** Over the course of a short rest, you inscribe this rune using dirt or crushed stone onto one weapon that deals bludgeoning damage. The weapon gains a ghostly brown aura, and bludgeoning damage dealt by the weapon ignores resistance and immunity. If you roll the maximum on the weapon’s damage die or dice, the target of your attack is knocked prone if it is a creature.

In addition, you can expend a spell slot to grant the weapon a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls equal to the spell slot’s level divided by three. This bonus means the weapon counts as magical for purposes of resistance.

These effects last for 24 hours or until you use this property again.

**Earthen Step.** While you are attuned to this rune, you can cast [meld into stone](../Spells/meld-into-stone.md) as a bonus action. You regain this ability after a short or long rest.

**Overwhelming Bolt.** As an action, you scribe this rune using dirt or crushed rock onto a creature within your reach as you expend a spell slot. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 12 + the level of the expended spell slot). On a failure, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage plus 1d8 bludgeoning damage per level of the expended spell slot and is knocked prone. On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.
