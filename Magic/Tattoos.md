# Magic Tattoos
Blending magic and artistry with ink and needles, magic tattoos imbue their bearers with wondrous effects and abilities. Magic tattoos are initially bound to magic needles, which transfer their magic to a creature. The designs of magic tattoos vary greatly in appearance depending on who created it, but they share general characteristics that hint at the effect of the tattoo.

Tattoos are the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md)' expression of runes, inscribing magic into the skin rather than into another surface. The Hordes have long believed that the power of the tattoo exceeds that of the rune because the tattoo can draw upon the power of the body upon which is scribed, where runes must be imbued with power from the outside, which the scribe, at the time of the scribing, must channel. This has never been demonstrated true or false in any event.

The tattoos described here can only be forged by [Tattoo Adepts](/Classes/Prestige/TattooAdept.md) or under their close supervision. Many spellcasters have sought to study the art without becoming an adept themselves, particularly artificers, but the skill and dedication required to be able to inscribe the tattoo correctly and (store it within the needle for use) requires levels in that prestige class.

Because of the origin of tattoos with the Hordes, in places where the Hordes are looked upon with suspicion (particularly [Dradehalia](/Nations/Dradehalia.md)), open tattoos are equally suspect and can cause negative reactions from surrounding onlookers. For the same reasons, [Yithia](/Nations/Yithi.md) and [Zhi](/Nations/Zhi.md) are quite comfortable with tattoos, and it is quite common to see nonmagical tattoos among the nobility there, which only fuels much of the ongoing hostility between those two nations and Dradehalia to the south.

Note that many of the Horde arcanists have discovered that these magical works of art needn’t be limited to just tattoos; they can also be presented as other body modifications such as brands, scarification, birthmarks, patterns of scales, or any other cosmetic skin adornment or alteration. This does not alter the effects or costs of the tattoo in any way. In such cases, the element used to deliver the cosmetic body modification would be something other than a tattoo needle, such as branding irons for brands or scars, or enchanted dragon scales for scale patterns, and so on.

Once inscribed on a creature’s skin, damage or injury doesn’t impair the tattoo’s function, even if the tattoo is defaced.
The rarer a magic tattoo is, the more space it occupies on a creature’s skin. The Magic Tattoo Coverage table offers guidelines for how large a given tattoo is.

**Magic Tattoo Coverage**
Tattoo Rarity | Area Covered
------------- | -----------
Common | Up to 6 inches
Uncommon | Half a limb or the scalp
Rare | One limb
Very Rare | Two limbs or the chest or upper back
Legendary | Two limbs and the torso

Two tattoos cannot occupy the same body location, so most creatures are limited to four rare tattoos, or one legendary and two rare tattoos, and so on.

**Tatto Attunement.** Some tattoos can be found in the wild, in the form of magic needles that can be used to apply the tattoo; this is attuning the tattoo. To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If you have multiple magic tattoos, they count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in the closest unoccupied space to you. You can voluntarily remove the tattoo at any time, which unattunes it.


## Tatoo Descriptions
The magic tattoos are presented in alphabetical order. They follow the rules for magic items, as presented in the *Dungeon Master’s Guide*.

### Absorbing Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), very rare (requires attunement)*

This tattoo incorporates designs that emphasize one color more than others. While the tattoo is on your skin, you have resistance to a type of damage associated with that color, as shown on the table below. The DM chooses the color or determines it randomly.

d10 | Damage Type | Color
--- | ----------- | -----
1 | Acid | Green
2 | Cold | Blue
3 | Fire | Blue
4 | Force | White
5 | Lightning | Yellow
6 | Necrotic | Black
7 | Poison | Violet
8 | Psychic | Silver
9 | Radiant | Gold
10 | Thunder | Orange

***Damage Absorption***. When you take damage of the chosen type, you can use your reaction to gain immunity against that instance of the damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage you would have taken. Once this reaction is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

### Barrier Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), rarity varies (requires attunement)*

This tattoo depicts protective imagery and uses ink that resembles liquid metal. While you aren’t wearing armor, the tattoo grants you an Armor Class depending on the tattoo’s rarity, as shown below. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

Rarity | AC
------ | --
Uncommon | 12 + your Dexterity modifier
Rare | 15 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of +2)
Very Rare | 18

### Coiling Grasp Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), uncommon (requires attunement)*

This tattoo has long intertwining designs. While the tattoo is on your skin, you can, as an action, cause the tattoo to extrude into inky tendrils, which reach for a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 3d6 force damage and be grappled by you. As an action, the creature can escape the grapple by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The grapple also ends if you halt it (no action required), if the creature is ever more than 15 feet away from you, or if you use this tattoo on a different creature.

### Eldritch Claw Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), uncommon (requires attunement)*

This tattoo depicts clawlike forms and other jagged shapes. While the tattoo is on your skin, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes.

***Eldritch Maul***. As a bonus action, you can empower the tattoo for 1 minute. For the duration, each of your melee weapon attacks can reach a target up to 30 feet away from you, as tendrils of ink launch from your weapon or unarmed strike toward the target. In addition, your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 force damage on a hit. Once used, this bonus action can’t be used again until the next dawn.

### Blood Fury Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), legendary (requires attunement)*

This tattoo evokes fury in its form and colors. While this tattoo is on your skin, you gain the following benefits:
* Your attack rolls score a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20.
* When you score a critical hit against a creature, that target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
* When a creature you can see damages you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature, with advantage on your attack roll.

### Illuminator’s Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), common (requires attunement)*

This tattoo contains beautiful calligraphy, images of writing implements, and the like. While this tattoo is on your skin, you can write with your fingertip as if it were an ink pen that never runs out of ink.

As an action, you can touch a piece of writing up to one page in length and speak a creature’s name. The writing becomes invisible to everyone other than you and the named creature for the next 24 hours. Either of you can dismiss the invisibility by touching the script (no action required). Once used, this action can’t be used again until the next dawn.

### Lifewell Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), rare (requires attunement)*

This tattoo comprises symbols of life and rebirth. While this tattoo is on your skin, you have resistance to necrotic damage.

***Death Ward***. When you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Once used, this benefit can’t be used again until the next dawn.

### Ghost Step Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), rare (requires attunement)*

This tattoo shifts and wavers on the skin, parts of it appearing blurred. The tattoo has 3 charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

As a bonus action while the tattoo is on your skin, you can expend 1 of the tattoo’s charges to become incorporeal until the end of your next turn. For the duration, you gain the following benefits:
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
* You can’t be grappled or restrained.
* You can move through creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn in a solid object, you take 1d10 force damage. If the effect ends while you are inside a solid object, you instead are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, and you take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet traveled.

### Masquerade Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), common (requires attunement)*

This tattoo appears on your skin as whatever you desire. As a bonus action, you can shape the tattoo into any color or pattern and move it to any area of your skin. Whatever form it takes, it is always obviously a tattoo. It can range in size from no smaller than a copper piece to an intricate work of art that covers all your skin.

***Disguise Self***. As an action, you can use the tattoo to cast the disguise self spell. Once the spell is cast from the tattoo, it can’t be cast from the tattoo again until the next dawn.

### Spellwrought Tattoo
*Wondrous item (tattoo), rarity varies*

This tattoo contains a single spell of up to 5th level, wrought on your skin by a magic needle. To use the tattoo, you must hold the needle against your skin where you want the tattoo to appear and speak the command word. The needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on your skin. Once the tattoo is on your skin, you can cast its spell, requiring no material components. The tattoo glows faintly while you cast the spell and for the spell’s duration. Once the spell ends, the tattoo vanishes from your skin.

The level of the spell in the tattoo determines the spell’s saving throw DC, attack bonus, spellcasting ability modifier, and the tattoo’s rarity, as shown in the Spellwrought Tattoo table.

***Shadowy Defense***. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to become shadowy and insubstantial for a moment, reducing the damage you take by half. Once used, this reaction can’t be used again until the next dawn.
