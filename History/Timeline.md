# Rough timeline
Some of this is only estimated, since records stretching back this far are often nonexistent, legendary, or mostly based on rumors and oral histories, but this is the (more or less) commonly-accepted timeline of Azgaarnoth since mortals began keeping records. All yearly dates are suffixed as "BF" (Before Fall) or "AF" (After Fall); in common usage, when no suffix is presented, it is assumed the date is "AF".
