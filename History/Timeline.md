# Rough timeline
Some of this is only estimated, since records stretching back this far are often nonexistent, legendary, or mostly based on rumors and oral histories, but this is the (more or less) commonly-accepted timeline of Azgaarnoth since mortals began keeping records. All yearly dates are suffixed as "BF" (Before Fall) or "AF" (After Fall); in common usage, when no suffix is presented, it is assumed the date is "AF".

Dailish Heresy emerges: ~4500 AF?

Alalihat/Zalabasa emerge: ~3000 AF?
Hordes sail for Tragekia: ~3500 AF?
Ulm emerges, takes his Ulmhordes to Dradehalia: ~5500 AF?

Yithi emerges: ~5000 AF?

First breakaway: ~6000 AF?

## The Ancient World (up to the Fall)
The Eldar were known to create the world, and chose to settle within the boundaries of what is now known as Azgaarnoth. A land of low forests and grasslands, punctuated by a spine of mountainous activity stretching through the center, the Eldar created a beautiful--if sparsely populated--paradise for themselves. Dragons, awesome and beautiful beings of majesty and might, were seen as partners and companions, in much the same way that a mage or druid would partner with a companion, save that dragons were equally intelligent and powerful.

As the Eldar moved through the world, they found that numerous tasks involved around upkeep, maintenance, development, and growth were distracting from their larger purpose. Convening, they decided to give life to two new races of creatures "in the Eldars' image" to serve as stewards and caretakers of the world while the Eldar went about their purpose. Thus were the ["Firstborn"](/Races/Firstborn.md), the [elves](/Races/Elves.md) and [dwarves](/Races/Dwarves.md), given life, one to concentrate their efforts on the natural world around them, the other to focus their efforts on the earth beneath. For thousands of years, elves, dwarves, and Eldar worked side by side to heighten and enhance the paradise that came to be known as Azgaarnoth.

> ### Ancient lifespans
> Ancient records and histories hold that these Firstborn lived much longer than their current kin. It is said that the original elves--what some call the "pure elves"--were in fact ageless, and lived for as long as they chose, barring any sort of physical harm broght to them. The first dwarves, too, were rumored to be ageless, although fewer tales of such "timeless ones" are told. It is theorized that their close exposure to the Eldar granted them longer lifespans--or else it was simply that the world was simply a safer place.

During this time, the Eldar and the Firstborn lived in a veritable utopia, crafting wondrous works, engaging in high magic, and possibly even journeying to distant planes and stars. It is theorized among a few scholars that it was this latter research that led to what came next.

* **~6000 BF - ~5000BF**: Some five or six thousand years before the Fall, the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md) emerge somewhere in eastern Yithia. It is not known where, how, or why these beings came into the world, but their massive numbers--lending them their name--create no end of problems for the Eldar, who viewed these creatures as invaders of their paradise. Almost immediately, conflict broke out, and the Eldar began to herd the Hordish creatures--nomadic by nature--back towards their origin point.

> ### Conquerors,.. or Refugees?
> When the Hordes arrived, they came in mass numbers and swords bared, or so the common tales claim. Amongst many scholars, however, this view is challenged as "simplistic" and at least partly incorrect. 
> That the Hordes came from someplace outside of Azgaarnoth is generally not open to debate--aside from orcs, Hordish races are generally incompatible genetically with the other races of Azgaarnoth, leading one to conclude that they evolved along a very different principles. From where they came, and why they came, is long since lost to history, but that lack of knowledge underpins a great deal of the debate.
> When the Hordes emerged in Yithia, it is not known if the Eldar attempted some form of peaceful coexistence, truce, or even parley with the Hordes--human/elvish/dwarvish scholars take it on faith that any such attempt would have likely failed, given the general tendencies of the various races that made up the Hordes. Hordish scholars, however, contend that the Hordes came as refugees from a larger conflict--possibly with the fiends that were barred entry to Azgaarnoth by the Compact--and would've welcomed peace had it been offered.
> Regardles of the history, it was not long before the Hordes turned their vast experience in combat against the Eldar, and the world has labored under that conflict ever since.

* **~4000 BF**: The Eldar discover a significant flaw in their plan: Despite their best efforts, the Hordes are winning. While individual Eldar and their elvish and dwarvish assistants can handle the small numbers of Hordes clans when they are scattered, a containment strategy brings them all together into one place and threatens to overwhelm the Eldar forces. Realizing that they are at a disadvantage due to numbers, the Eldar choose to create a second genetic line, [humans](/Races/Humans.md), to offset the numerical advantages of the Hordes. Humans are given shorter lifespans, a more aggressive reproductive biology, and an insatiable curiosity and adaptive mindset, all as counters to the limitless numbers and extraordinary cunning of the Hordes. Elves and dwarves welcome humans into their homes, and instruct humans in their respective areas of interest. They find that humans, while adequate in any climate and equally adept in magic or might, find no particular advantage in any. Within a century of their birth, humans steadily grow in number, and begin to offset the Hordish advantage of aggressiveness and numbers.

* **~3000BF**: By this time the Hordes adapt, learning how to adjust to the added presence of the humans, and begin to press westward again. Any time the Firstborn and humans seek to re-establish the containment, the Hordes break the circle and the Eldar's forces are forced to withdraw, but when the Hordes flow west, their attacks break down and they are forced back again.

* **~2500BF**: The first of the [Created](/Races/Created.md) appear in the world, as [dragonborn](/Races/Dragonborn.md) and [aasimari](/Races/Aasimari.md) take to the field against the Hordes. [Tieflings](/Races/Tiefling.md) also appear, but do not take to combat on any side for quite a few centuries. Origins of the aasimari and tiefling races are not clear, but the dragonborn are presented by several of their "parent" dragons with love and affection.
    The Hordish races, meanwhile, begin to make a stronger push to escape the northwestern continent, and much of the battle begins to spill over into the waters and [Undersea](/Geography/Undersea.md). First records of those [water-homed races](/Races/Undersea.md) also emerge, though scholars are entirely unclear as to the origin of the [tortles](/Races/Tortles.md)--neither Eldar nor Hordish history speaks of them at all.

* For the next 2500 years, the Eldar-Hordish War settles into something of a stalemate as the Hordes push west, meet resistance, fall back, regroup, resist the Eldar advance to the east, and push west again. As the Firstborn, Created, and humans deepen their lines and military forces, the Eldar slowly start to fade from the world, choosing to work through their mortal agents more frequently rather than directly interact. It is not until much later (the First Millennium) that the Eldar's Children realize the depth of the Elar's withdrawal--thanks to the growing population of the Firstborn, humans, and Created, it's quite common for one to live an entire lifetime and never spot an Eldar in person.

* **~2000BF**: Given the greater numbers of population and a need to take over some of the responsibility previously reserved to the Eldar, humans propose a system of government ("the Courts") and administration. The Firstborn and Created, although a little amused at the humans' audacity to take over as the Eldar did, agree to the plan. Duchies are drawn, Ducal Seats are assigned, and the Courts are formed. Although offered Seats, Firstborn and Created generally stick to the belief that the Eldar will resume their administrative roles, and most politely refuse (though some do). The first of the Great Houses are thus formed.

## The First Millennium: The Fall
* **0 AF**: An arbitrary point in time when the Eldar were considered to have "fallen"; most historians believe that this is the year the Eldar were viewed by a mortal for the last time, when (legend says) they went to a (since lost) city near [Dorenoress](/Cities/Dorenoress.md) to discuss their plans and strategy. Firstborn, Created, and humans all worry that the loss of the Eldar will tip the scales in the Hordish favor, but extensive reconnaissance suggests that the Hordes are grappling with their own internal conflicts that rob them of the unity of purpose they held when they first reached Azgaarnothian shores five millennia prior. Seeking to keep the Eldar foremost in their thoughts, they rename the lands they claim "Liria", which is said to be the name of one of the last Eldar, and thus are the Lirian Courts given the name they will hold for the next eight millennia. It is widely agreed that the Lirian Courts govern only above ground and on land, leaving the [Underdark](/Geography/Underdark.md) and [Undersea](/Geography/Undersea.md) to continue to govern as they wish.

* **323 AF**: **Founding of the Kaevarian Church.** A charismatic and intellectural figure, Mar Tolweth, emerges in Migleme claiming a religious doctrine in which all beings of higher divine power (meaning the Eldar, the Pantheonic gods, and even the dragons) are servants of a single, omniscient and omnipotent being. Calling it "Kaevar" ("The One" in Eldar), Tolweth fashions a theology around this notion of a single deity/force/power, and his anointed priests begin to receive divine spellcasting ability, providing at least some solid backing to his assertions.
    For many, Kaevarian doctrine provides comfort in the principles of Law and Order, and given that Tolweth's priests are often assisting openly in fighting the chaos of the immediate post-Fall world, many flock to his Church and its message. By 1500 AF, Kaevarian temples are commonplace in the West, the South, and the North.

* **417 AF**: **Founding of the Draconic Orders.** Finding that they require a dedication to martial, arcane, and divine might that currently is lacking in their military structure, seven mortals agree to found an Order that is dedicated to the principles of the metallic dragons. With the full support of the Lirian Courts, the Draconic Orders begin to assemble some of the best, brightest, boldest, and gifted into rigourous training. By 450AF, these Draconic Knights begin to move out all across the Western lands, aiding in keeping order, righting injustices, and protecting the people.

* **762 AF**: **Founding of the Dwarven Courts.** The dwarves grudgingly admit that the humans might have had a good idea in the creation of the Lirian Courts, and form the Dwarven Courts for their holdings below ground. By agreement, the Lirian Courts and the Dwarven Courts engage in deep cultural cross-fostering of families, trade, and general exchange, for fear that not doing so will lead to isolation. As a result, many dwarves live their entire lives on the surface, and humans and elves are often found in the Underdark.

## Second Millennium: The Exodus
The second millennium after the Fall was characterized primarily by one world-shaking event: The Dwarven Exodus. Tribes of the Hordes pour into the Underdark in the Daw Mountains, and steadily push the dwarven nation out of their cities. Dwarves become refugees as they flee for safety either above ground, deeper underground, or further west, until they reach the shores of the Mighalian Narrows. It is a stunning setback and deep embarrassment to dwarven pride, and continues to echo through dwarven society eight thousand years later.

* **~1100 AF**: Hordes tribes, apparently stymied by their stalemate in western Yithia, begin to explore the Daws mountains, specifically the cavern systems that seem to run throughout the range. Where before the Hordes assumed the mountains to be sheer rock, they find that they can move for quite some distance underground before needing to come to the surface again. Over the next century, more and more Hordes tribes discover that they can survive quite well in the Underdark, and many begin to move in earnest against the various Dwarven cities carved into the stone there.

* **1137 AF - 1861 AF**: **Dwarven Exodus.** The first of the [Seventeen Dwarven Cities](/Geography/SeventeenCities.md), Khun Ladur, deep underground near the city of [Dukomi](/Cities/Dukomi.md), falls as the Hordes begin to bring the full weight of their numbers to bear against the dwarves. The dwarvish refugees of Khun Ladur flee to Bhem Buldar. As subsequent cities fall, the steady migration/retreat/exile of the dwarves from their cities in the Underdark become collectively known as the Exodus, and will continue for the next thousand years or so.
    * **1137 AF**: Khun Ladur, first of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1156 AF**: Bhem Buldar, second of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1201 AF**: Khun Boldohr, third of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1247 AF**: Khun Huldun, fourth of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1301 AF**: Bhem Boram, fifth of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1303 AF**: Khun Buldihr, sixth of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1373 AF**: Kher Todihr, seventh of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1422 AF**: Khun Kulgrin, eighth of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1451 AF**: Bhem Thaghdihm, ninth of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1512 AF**: Bhem Meraruhm, tenth of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1557 AF**: Khun Gogbaduhr, eleventh of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1587 AF**: Kher Darwohrum, twelfth of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1642 AF**: Kher Khinturm, thirteenth of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1690 AF**: Khun Mamalduhr, fourteenth of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1776 AF**: Kolgalir, fifteenth (and greatest) of the Seveteen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1821 AF**: Khun Damkuldihr, sixteenth of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes.

    * **1861 AF**: Khun Bernkuldir, seventeenth of the Seventeen Cities, falls to the Hordes. 

    After Khun Bernkuldir's Fall, no dwarven city in the Underdark remains east of the Mighalian Narrows. Rumors persist that there are passages through the Underdark under the Narrows (particularly poignant given the Narrows' relative shallow drafts), but no dwarven undercity under Lirian soil is ever assaulted.

## Third Milennium

* **2242 - 2276 AF**: **First Dwarven Return.** The Dwarven Courts-in-Exile declare their intent to Return to their lost cities and take them back by force. This declaration, known as the Return (and later, the First Return), is hailed by dwarf and non-dwarf alike as a great moment, and all of non-Hordish Azgaarnoth celebrates the declaration. 
    * **2242 AF**: The Return begins; a large force of dwarves and their kin races (gnomes, halflings) descend into the Daw Mountains near [Nytherion](/Cities/Nytherion.md). Initial successes are fast, as the tribes of the Hordes are clearly not prepared for such a large mass of troops. Within a few years, the Return has made significant strides in clearing out Underdark caverns, roads, and pathways, and dwarvish settlements are founded in anticipation of future success.
    * **2251 AF**: The Return stalemates against larger-than-expected numbers of Hordes at the gates of Khun Bernkuldir; they settle in to siege.
    * **2270 AF**: The Return's siege of Khun Bernkuldir is broken; the Return begins a retreat.
    * **2276 AF**: The Return is declared over, and dwarvish pride is severely tested.
    By the end of the Return, dwarvish settlements are being attacked by tribes of Hordes. Those dwarves in settlements grimly cling to their gains as best they can, but it is clear that the dwarves vastly underestimated the effort required, and by 2300AF contact has been lost. 

(2nd Return - ~2750)

(3rd Return - ~3100)

(4th and 5th Returns - ~3300 and ~3350)

(6th Return - ~3700)

(7th Return - ~4100)

(8th Return - ~4400)

## 5900AF: Beginning of the Modern World
* **7397 AF**: Modern day.
