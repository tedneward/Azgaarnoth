# The shaping of the modern world
(The last thousand years or so.)

## Lirian Domination
Until a millenia ago, Liria spanned from Bedia in the west to Tragekia to the east, Anor and Al'Uma to the north, and Dradehalia to the south. Only the ancestral homelands of the Hordes (what is now Yithi and Zhi lands) stood alone, and it is a testament to the fierce prowess of Horde warriors and warlocks that such a massive empire could be battled to a standstill. Aside from the Horde to the east, Liria governed over all of Azgaarnoth.

The human governors struggled to keep their empire coherent, however, and even with the aid of the Draconic Orders and other organizations, often fell short in addressing the needs of the people--the empire was simply too big and too widespread to govern effectively without the Eldars' particular gifts to aid them. Constant warfare from the Hordes--coupled with the periodic chaos from the various Returns--meant Lirian resources were often stretched quite thin. When various charismatic strategists began to assemble their own fighting forces and rented them to the Lirian generals in the east in exchange for coin and certain privileges, Lirian generals were only too happy to accept (and thus lay the groundwork for the mercenary companies). When arcane researchers offered similar terms--magical assistance in exchange for some limited autonomy--again Lirian governors were all too ready to accept. By the time the merchant guilds had formed and approached the Lirian rulers with their offer, much of the pattern was set in place. Liria had the resources to better combat the threats posed by the Hordes, but at the expense of a great deal of the power normally reserved to government.

## Alalihat and Zabalasa
As Liria battled the Hordes in Yithia, two charismatic figures emerged in Mererevets that would come to dominate the Eldar's ancient ancestral home continent. Alalihat was a dark and brooding figure, capable of great miracles of faith, and he preached a doctrine of humanity's failures of faith in the Eldar. Claiming that the world could only be put right when the Eldar resumed their natural place as leaders and shepherds of Azgaarnoth's future, Alalihat led a religious revolution against Lirian oversight, and city after city found itself swayed by his words. When Mt Bezulb erupted, and continued to spew forth lava for years, then decades at a time, Alalihat took it as a sign of fiendish forces moving against Azgaarnoth, and began the ritual daily prayers and worship that permeate Alalihatian lands to this day.

The disciple known as Zabalasa first appeared as one of Alalihat's advisors and bodyguards, and gained fame when he single-handedly stopped a Horde assassination against Alalihat while attemping commune with the Eldar in Nyllar. Seeing the Horde threat up close, the normally upbeat and perpetually optimistic disciple took a small retinue to the east, to view the battles waged against the Hordes there. Little is said of where the band went or what they saw, but when they returned to join Alalihat in Zvelaino two years later, grim determination had replaced Zabalasa's optimism and carefree outlook, and he agitated for Alalihat to raise an army to defeat the Hordes. When Alalihat refused, declaring the Hordes to be "of no concern to beings such as the Eldar", Zabalasa broke away from his Teacher, and chose instead to preach a message of martial prowess--that the Fall of the Eldar was not due to a lack of piety, but a lack of arms. Instead of feeding the Eldar empty words and rituals, Zabalasa argued, they required able-bodied soldiers to battle the Hordes, and by taking the burden of combat upon humanity's shoulders, humans would then allow the Eldar to return to their place at humanity's head.

Before long, the arguments turned into threats, and then blood. Zabalasa moved from city to city, recruiting to his cause and training relentlessly, and within a year had a sizable army. Turning half of them east to battle the Hordes, he took the remainder and carved out lands for his own use, to support the battles to the east and safeguard their supplies. Alalihat's supporters took this to be rebellion, and mustered their own forces to defeat the heretics. Battles broke out all along the plains surrounding Chetmyzk and Hogilos, mostly to stalemate--Zabalasa's troops, while much better trained and equipped, were much smaller in number than their Alalihatian opponents. Any reinforcements obtained by Zabalasan recruiting were shipped east, where the Zabalasans were enjoying significant success against the Hordes, and Zabalasa looked forward to exterminating the Hordes in pitched battles at Venonaxaxis, Onimintilarma, and finally Dragazakama.

However, Zabalasa discovered, to his horror, that the battles were not having the intended result--rather than exterminating the Hordes, Zabalasan troops were merely accelerating a general diaspora of the Hordes to the south, into Tragekia, and then again into eastern Dradehalia. Legend tells that when Zabalasa received word from Lirian and Dradehalian messengers that the Hordes had, in fact, seized sizable territories there and sacked several human and elven cities there, Zabalasa wept bitterly, covered his face with sackcloth and fled into the wilderness, never to be seen again. Whatever the reason, Zabalasa himself disappeared from sight, and Zabalasan troops were required to reinforce their front with their Alalihatian cousins. Much of Yithian and Zhian lands remained unoccupied for centuries, populated by a gradual blending of Horde, eldar, and human individuals until a new, blended identity emerged, forged civilization out of the hills and ruins, and founded the Principality. Those Yithians who sought a deeper relationship with the world were encouraged to find alternate lands in which to settle, and eventually migrated north to found the Theocracy in Zhi.

Meanwhile, Liria struggled to face the savage Hordes in Tragekia, battling them to an eventual stalemate along the Babuzah River, only to see Hordes turn south again and land at Swagab and swarm into eastern Dradehalia. Lirian forces were stretched to their limits.

## First Breakaway
Inevitably, it began in what is now Travenia--a merchant fleet was lost to the denizens of the Undersea in the Travenian Sea, and the populace in Silbel demanded better guards. When Liria refused, citing the pressures in the east of the Hordes pressing south, the nobility and citizenry collectively decided on drastic action, and quiet plans were made. Within months, the plans were ready, and almost overnight Travenia became a separate nation, governed by a collection of ruling families. Thus began the long war of independence against Liria, and the steady and slow decline of Lirian influence over Azgaarnoth.

When decades passed and Travenia was still no closer to pacification or subjugation that it was when it began, the lands west of Travenia began to question their own loyalty to a distant throne on the other side of an ostensibly hostile power. Travenia sought to convince them to join the Oligarchy, but the match had already been lit: Merchants in Mis, aware of the value their woods offered to the world, chose to hire sufficient mercenary companies to defend against incursion (whether Lirian or Travenian in nature), and declared Travesimia to be independent. Their cousins to the west declared similarly the sovereign nation of Bedia, and lay claim to the uncharted wilderness of Northern Bedia.

Neither Liria nor Travenia was inclined to accept these declarations, and Travenia moved first against the Travesimians. (Liria had by this point grown to accept that their empire was fragmenting, and returned much of their focus eastward and southward.) Travenia navies sought to force landings at numerous points on Travesimian lands, and the Traveian Sea ran red with blood for many years. Landings were finally successful in seeral places, most notably to the north in Bovefose, but the Travenians could never muster sufficient force to conquer the Travesimian lands, nor could the Travesimian mercenaries completely push the Travenians out.

Across the Lishalsound, armies from Liria, Travenia, and Travesimia all found themselves squaring off. Travesimia held the strategic island of Moswind, but Lirian cities in the eastern part of the island (Salle, Steamer, Cliront, and Flavengulf) formed a significant strategic logjam, and Travesimian forces found themselves battling Travenian armies over Gloomerses, Nigme, and Deerross. Travenian forces even managed to push far enough south to threaten Flatwath.

Bedian independence, meanwhile, was accepted as a *fait accompli* by all sides, and the fledgling nation was left to eke out its survival against its distance from trade markets and the wilderness within its own borders. Bedian military and naval forces spent the better part of a decade pushing Undersea invaders out of the swamps to the south of Dradow, and carving out a few toeholds of civilization on the eastern shores of North Bedia.

## Dradehalian Breakaway
The landing of the Hordes on eastern Dradehalia took those populations by surprise, and their
