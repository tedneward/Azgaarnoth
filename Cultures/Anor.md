# Culture: Anor
The starkly harsh existence that the residents of [Dradehalia](/Geography/Dradehalia.md) were forced to assume during their [war with the Hordes](/History/Modern.md) has led to the rise of an entirely new culture in the South, focusing on ruthlessness and focus. If not exactly cruel (although many willingly embrace cruelty), Anorians are also not compassionate, and see hardship as simply one more obstacle that must be overcome. Those who cannot overcome hardship simply did not deserve to live or thrive; those who did, did so because they understood that obstacles are there to be surpassed.

The average Anorian has no time in their life for gods, worship, or charity, as these things distract from the pursuit of survial. However, if any of these things provide clear progress on an Anorian's goals (perhaps worship at the altar of a god of agriculture has proven to generate better weather), they will embrace them without hesitation. To an Anorian, the outcome is all that matters.

Many who call themselves "Anorians" are not evil, but many of evil pursuit call themselves "Anorians". The Dread Emperor Himself sets the tone, and his court ensures that any who would dissent against the Dread Emperor is marginalized, silenced, or eliminated; as the center of Anorian culture, the Dread Imperial Court brooks no interference in their plans.
