## Al'Uman Backgrounds
These backgrounds are those specifically of Al'Uman background: [Alalihat](/Nations/Alalihat.md), [Zalabasa](/Nations/Zabalasa.md), and [Almalz](/Nations/Almalz.md).

* [Acolyte](Backgrounds/Acolyte.md): Al'Uman acolytes are almost always of their tribe's established religion (Alilihatian or Zalabasan).
* [Artisan](Backgrounds/Artisan.md): one thing, regardless of religious dispute, that all Al'Umans agree upon is a love of beauty--whether expressed in stone, glass, paint, or jewelry, artisans are revered and sometimes even coveted among the Courts of the Grasslands.
* [Athlete](Backgrounds/Athlete.md): Al'Uman tribes frequently hold physical contests of skill during festivals, and more than one tribal rivalry has been born of a lost wager on an athletic competition.
* [Charlatan](Backgrounds/Charlatan.md): tales of notorious tricksters and con-men litter the Al'Uman legends, and many seek to emulate those who came before them.
* [City Watch](Backgrounds/CityWatch.md)
* [Cloistered Scholar](Backgrounds/CloisteredScholar.md): much knowledge is stored and curated by the Guardians of the Prophet's Temple in [Merevets](/Cities/Merevets.md), or its offshoots in various Al'Uman cities.
* [Courtier](Backgrounds/Courtier.md): Al'Uman court ceremony is the source of legends, and courtiers are often revered for their ability to navigate the courts, even if they serve no other useful purpose.
* [Criminal](Backgrounds/Criminal.md): it is said that in the Land of Fate, if you cannot make your way, you take your way. Romantic tales of criminals stir even the most cynical Al'Uman heart.
* [Dailan Scholar](Backgrounds/DailanScholar.md): though secretive, Dailan scholars are everywhere in Azgaarnoth.
* [Entertainer](Backgrounds/Entertainer.md)
* [Far Traveler](Backgrounds/FarTraveler.md):
* [Folk Hero](Backgrounds/FolkHero.md):
* [Guild Artisan](Backgrounds/GuildArtisan.md): many Al'Uma find the allure of a comfortable Merchant Guild-backed life a fine way to spend their lives.
* [Guild Merchant](Backgrounds/GuildMerchant.md): Merchant Guilds have less pull in Al'Uma than they do in the Gozdoran lands, but still they are present, and many Al'Umans find Merchant Guilds to be an effective counterweight to the pull of tribe or Court.
* [Hermit](Backgrounds/Hermit.md): among the Al'Uma, hermits are often homeless vagabonds who earn nothing but scorn.
* [Mercenary Veteran](Backgrounds/MercenaryVeteran.md): some went to fight their religious rivals over the border, some went to fight the accursed Hordes to their east and south, some even joined a mercenary company and fought the world over; all came home with scars, both body and soul.
* [Nomad](Backgrounds/Nomad.md): nearly half of the population of Al'Uma come from nomadic tribes who roam the grasslands.
* [Smuggler](Backgrounds/Smuggler.md): the nobility of Al'Uma despise them, but the citizenry often romanticize them, and more than one tribe has been known to sponsor their activities to the tribe's benefit (and/or to a rival tribe's detriment).
