# Cultures of Azgaarnoth

## [Gozdor](Gozdor.md): Human

## [Dail](Dail.md): Human Arcane

## [Al'Uma](AlUma.md): Human Divine (Arabic)

## [Anor](Anor.md): Human Extraplanar (Tiefling)

## [Uruk](Uruk.md), [Ugluk](Ugluk.md): Horde

It is said that "uruk" and "ugluk" are two ancient tribes of the Hordes, and may explain the "split" that occurred over time among the Hordes (into the Tragekian United Hordes and the Ulm Horde), but some cultural differences have emerged between the two that justify their distinction in modern-day discussions.

## Dokalfar: ???

## [Kobblin](Kobblin.md): Chaotic Horde

## [Durinn](Durinn.md): Human and Horde

## [Rakhnid](Rakhnid.md): Unitarian (Asian)
Human, Eldar, and Horde, mixed together into a strangely compelling pragmatic mix.
