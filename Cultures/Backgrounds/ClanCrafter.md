# Background: Clan Crafter
The Stout Folk a re well known for their artisanship
and the worth of their ha ndiworks, and you have been
trained in that ancient tradition. For years you labored
under a dwarf master of the craft, enduring long hours.
and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to
gain the fin e s kills you possess today.
You are most likely a dwarf, but not necessarily- particularly
in the North, the shield dwarf clans learned
long ago that only proud fools who are more concerned
for their egos than their craft turn away promising
apprentices, even those of other races. If you aren't a
dwarf, however, you have taken a solemn oath never
to take on an apprentice in the craft: it is not for nondwarves
to pass on the s kills of Moradin's favored
children. You would have no difficulty, however, finding
a dwarf master who was willing to receive potential apprentices
who came with your recommendation.
Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight
Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools
Languages: Dwarvish or one other of your choice if you
a lready speak Dwarvish

proficient, a maker's mark chisel used to mark your
handiwork with the symbol of the clan of crafters you
learned your skill from, a set of traveler's clothes, and
a pouch containing 5 gp and a gem worth 10 gp
FEATURE: RESPECT OF THE STOUT FOLK
As well respected as clan crafte rs are among outsiders,
no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do. You
a lways have free room and board in any place where
s hield dwarves or gold dwarves dwell, and the individuals
in such a settlement might vie among themselves to
determine who can offer you (and possibly your compatriots)
the finest accommodations and assistance.
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the
Player 's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations,
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit
your identity as a clan crafter. (For instance, consider
the words "guild" and "clan" to be interchangeable.)
Your bond is almost certainly related to the master
or the clan that taught you, or else to the work that you
produce. Your ideal might have to do with maintaining
the high quality of your work or preserving the dwarven
traditions of craftsmanship.
