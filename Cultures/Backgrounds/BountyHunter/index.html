<h1 id="background-bounty-hunter">Background: Bounty Hunter</h1>
<p>Most of the time, the constables, sheriffs, and
watchmen of the world capture the bad guys and
administer the necessary justice. From time to
time, however, the worst, most despicable crooks
and con men elude the authorities and run for
freedom. Left to their own, these scum almost
certainly commit more crimes and hurt more
people. That’s where you come in.
As a bounty hunter, you travel from town to
town and village to village in search of the
worst of the worst. You track down and
apprehend those criminals who’ve escape
justice. At the same time, you earn a living, so
it’s a win-win sort of situation. If there are times
where you end up capturing an innocent man,
well, that’s not your problem, so long as you get
paid.
Give consideration to your former life as a bounty
hunter. What started you in the profession, and
what convinced you to get out? Did you have
regular clients, or did you take whatever work
you could find? Which criminal proved the most
dangerous or challenging to hunt down? Did you
work with a crew, or did you prefer to remain
solo? You and your GM can discuss the campaign
regions in which you served as a bounty hunter,
and what sorts of criminals you typically
pursued. Perhaps you usually served the forces of
law and order, but at other times--when you
needed the coin--you might have worked for other
criminals or shady organizations who wanted
people retrieved.</p>
<p>Skill Proficiencies: Investigation, Survival
Tool Proficiencies: Your choice of disguise kit,
forgery kit, or thieves’ tools
Languages: One of your choice
Equipment: A set of tools of your choice (disguise
kit, forgery kit, or thieves’ tools), a set of manacles
or similar restraints, collection of wanted posters
and bounty claims, a set of traveler’s clothes, and
a pouch containing 10 gp</p>
<p>Feature: Bloodhound
You possess a special sense for locating refuges,
hideouts, and sanctuaries to which escapees and
fugitives are likely to flee. You also have a good
instinct for the best tactic for extracting
information from a contact, be it through bribery,
intimidation, flattery, or outright lies. When you
question an individual regarding a target you are
hunting, be it a person or object, you know which
skill stands the highest chance of success (typically
Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion, but other
skills may work better in certain circumstances).
Suggested Characteristics
Your line of work often involves dogged, patient
legwork, including interrogating witnesses,
identifying tracks, gathering rumors and hints,
and uncovering local hiding spots. These long
periods of investigation are then punctuated
by brief, explosive moments of pursuit and
violence. You’ve learned not to trust anyone, and
you’ve come to understand that every person--
good or bad--has a reason for what they do. Those
reasons may prove foolish or ignorant, but that
does not discount those motives.
As a bounty hunter, you’ve learned that few
people respect you, and nobody likes it when you
show up. The crooks hate and fear you because
you represent imprisonment or worse. The
officials and law officers look down on you as
somehow corrupt and greedy. Nobody likes you,
but sooner or later, everyone needs your special
services. Hate, fear, scorn, or disgust, none of
those feelings matter to you; the only thing that
matters is getting paid for a job well done.
D8   Personality Trait 
1   Everyone hides something, everyone lies, and 
everyone holds some dark secret. The key is 
exploiting these simple truths.<br />
2   I’m most comfortable when surrounded by 
crooks, thieves, bastards, and killers. 
3   My last job turned pear‐shaped right quick, and 
now I’m the one who’s being hunted. 
4   I like to collect trophies and mementos of my 
captures. 
5  I cultivate a gruff, unpolished, brutish attitude. It 
helps people underestimate me. 
6   Every bad guy has a tale to tell—I’ve heard them 
all. I don’t believe anybody’s sob story. 
7   Whenever I stay in one place for too long I get 
irritable. 
8   I don’t trust the city watch any more than I trust 
the local thieves and cutthroats. 
D6   Ideal 
1   Vengeance. Criminals killed my family and ruined 
my old life. I won’t rest until I’ve tracked them 
down and hurt them. (Evil) 
2   Greed. Keep your morals and crusades to 
yourself. I’m in it for the gold. (Evil) 
3   Daredevil. Life is best when I’m chasing someone 
down or beating someone up. (Chaotic) 
4   Justice. There are horrible, monstrous people on 
the loose, and they need to be hunted and 
punished. (Lawful) 
5   Ambition. I aim to prove I’m the best at what I 
do, even if it kills me. (Any) 
6   Obligation. I keep my word and honor my 
promises. (Lawful) 
D6   Bond 
1   I’ve made a lot of enemies, and now they’re out 
for my blood.<br />
2   Someone helped me escape a lifetime of crime 
by offering me a stark choice. I must provide the 
same chance to others. 
3   My job is to defend the law by going outside the 
law when necessary. 
4   I’ve learned many dark, dirty secrets, and I 
intend on using those to my own advantage. 
5   The thrill of the chase and the excitement of the 
takedown keep me interested in life. 
6   After one too many bad investments and a loan 
from the thieves’ guild, I need to pay off my 
debtors… or else. 
D6   Flaw 
1   I always assume you have a sinister ulterior 
motive for everything you do. 
2   I’m a sucker for the sight of gold; I take stupid 
risks for the shiny stuff. 
3   A fool and his money are soon separated. 
Everything I earn goes to strong booze, good 
food, and warm companionship. 
4   I’d sell out my grandmother if it would save my 
life. 
5   My bad temper lands me in trouble more times 
than I care to admit. 
6   I’m a great judge of character, and I always know 
when someone is lying to me. </p></div>
