<h1 id="background-battle-born">Background: Battle Born</h1>
<p>You were born, bred, and trained for combat. From
the earliest age, you learned how to fight, how to
kill, and how to survive. You survived the most
intense, brutal, and extreme training imaginable,
all aimed at one purpose: to turn you into a war
machine. Whether your parents willingly gave you
over to the war masters upon your birth, or you
were sold as a slave into the legion, your life has
never been your own until now.
When creating a battle-born, collaborate with your
GM to create a suitable organization, order, or cult
responsible for raising and training you. You may
have belonged to a religious group, the king’s
secret army, a slave master who sells his soldiers to
the highest bidder, or a military unit controlled by
a secret society of mages. As a battle-born, you
fought and killed those who you were told were
your enemies, but you almost never understood
the reasons or the cause.
In designing your backstory, consider a few
questions. Do you know who your parents or
family were? Do you know where you came from,
and if so, where? Who was the most influential of
your trainers? Did this instructor treat you and
your fellow soldiers with strict discipline or harsh
cruelty? Describe the worst battle you fought in,
and come up with a few details about the other
soldiers who fought and died at your side.
Beyond your experiences during training and your
early battles, you should also consider how and
why your character earned (or took) his freedom.
Did you fulfill an oath or contract of service, were
you discharged due to wounds or trauma, or
perhaps one day you simply grew tired of the
killing and deserted? The method of your discharge
from service offers a few hints as to whether your
character is wanted as a deserter, a fugitive, or a
war criminal.
Now that your life encompasses more than endless
warfare, how well are you adjusting to “civilian” 
life? What gaps do you suffer in your social skills
and etiquette? How do you handle unusual
situations and interactions, especially those where
violence is the wrong solution? Are you awkward
and withdrawn, or are you boisterous and
outgoing?
Answering these questions helps not only build
your backstory, but also helps enrich the campaign
as a whole.
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival
Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools
Languages: One of your choice
Equipment: An iron collar identifying your unit
and designation, a memento taken from a
vanquished foe (an ear, a rank insignia, a
necklace, or a shred of a banner), a set of common
clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp
Feature: Combat Sense
You grew up on the field of battle, and as a result
you possess the exceptional ability to assess the
surrounding terrain in the blink of an eye. Before
combat begins, if you have a round to study the
local landscape you instinctively understand the
best places to locate cover, you identify difficult
terrain, and you can make a Wisdom (Perception)
check to spot difficult-to-see potential hazards,
such as quicksand, thin ice, and camouflaged pits.
You also notice the best, most tactically
appropriate ambush sites.
Suggested Characteristics
With rare exception, battle-born live and die
having never tasted freedom or independence.
They spend their lives from birth until death as
virtual slaves as part of a tightly interwoven
brotherhood (or sisterhood). As a result, most
battle-born tend to obey orders instinctively,
seldom questioning the reasons behind a
command. The combination of brutal training,
indoctrination into the battle-born way of life, and
a constant diet of combat leaves the typical battleborn intensely loyal, obedient to a fault,
unflinchingly brave, and a complete and total child
when it comes to social graces. Most battle-born
never have the chance to adapt to the civilian
lifestyle, and those who do earn such a chance
often find it difficult to fit in.
D8   Personality Trait 
1   I detest soft living and a lull in the action; it 
makes me agitated and cranky.<br />
2   I approach every situation as if combat were 
imminent. 
3   Humor is a difficult concept for me to 
understand. 
4   Death and I are old friends. Its approach brings 
me no fear, but it makes me reckless.<br />
5   I once strangled a monster with my bare hands 
to save my comrades, and I won’t hesitate to do 
the same for my new allies. 
6   Crowds make me nervous, and my hand never 
strays far from my weapon. 
7   After a life devoid of freedom, I want to 
experience every sight, smell, and sound for 
myself. 
8   Lying is an art that eludes me, and I prefer to tell 
the blunt truth at all times. 
D6   Ideal 
1   Loyalty. You dedicate your life to your shield‐
mates, and you never abandon them. (Lawful) 
2   Freedom. My days of following orders blindly are 
over. I’ll never accept servitude again. (Chaotic) 
3   Justice. I want to liberate all slaves, making 
certain no one ever experiences what I’ve 
experienced. (Good) 
4   Duty. Our job is to obey our superiors and carry 
out their orders‐‐do not question those who 
command us. (Lawful) 
5   Might. I will use my skills and my strength to 
wring what I want out of life, and damn the 
costs. (Evil) 
6   Independence. I fight for my comrades, but I no 
longer fight for anyone else’s cause. (Neutral) 
D6   Bond 
1   One day, I will find my family and learn about 
why they gave me away.<br />
2   I seek to serve a worthy cause, to fight for my 
beliefs, and to make a true difference in the 
world. 
3   Those who imprison and enslave others must be 
punished, regardless of the cost. 
4   Everything I do is in service to my comrades. 
They are my family and my world. 
5   A monster devastated my former unit, and I have 
sworn vengeance against it. 
6   During my time as a warrior, I committed terrible 
deeds. If I am to know peace, I must atone for 
those sins. </p>
<p>D6   Flaw 
1   I’m hopelessly awkward in social situations; I 
often say the wrong thing at the worst time. 
2   Violence and conflict are how I solve challenges. I 
am the hammer, and every problem I see is a 
nail.<br />
3   Expressing myself often proves difficult, and I 
tend to keep to myself. 
4   When I see a nobleman or a slaver, I want to 
choke the life from their miserable bodies. 
5   If you’ve never fought and bled in combat, your 
opinions are worthless. 
6   I can’t get enough of life’s indulgences, 
pleasures, and vices. So much to experience, and 
so little time! </p></div>
