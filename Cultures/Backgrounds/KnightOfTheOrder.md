# Background: Knight of the Order
You belong to a militant order who have sworn oaths to achieve a certain goal. The nature of this goal depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is without question a vital and honorable endeavor. The most obvious of these is the [Order of the Dragon](/Organizations/DraconicOrder/DraconicOrder.md), but other, smaller, knighthoods exist, including the Dread Order of the Emperor (a militant order devoted to the Dread Emperor of Dradehalia) and the [Marshals](/Organizations/Marshals.md) (a militant order devoted to upholding the law in Yithi and Zhi).





Though the term "knight" conjures ideas of mounted,
heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly
orders in FaerO.n don't restrict their membership to such
individuals. The goals and philosophies of the order are
more important than the gear and fighting style of its
members, and so most of these orders aren't limited to
fighting types, but are open to a ll sorts of folk who are
willing to battle and die for the order's cause.
The "Knightly Orders of FaerO.n" sidebar details
several of the orders that are active at present and is designed
to help inform your decision about which group
you owe allegiance to.

Skill Proficiencies: Persuasion, plus one from among
Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate
for your order
Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set or musical
instrument
Languages: One of your choice
Equipment: One set of traveler's clothes, a signet,
banner or seal representing your place or rank in the
order, and a pouch containing 10 gp
FEATURE: KNIGHTLY REGARD
You receive shelter and succor from members of your
knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its
aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid
from temples and other religious communities of your
deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community-
whether a lone settlement or a great nationthat
they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can
find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their
ideals, and those who share those ideals.
This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and
healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky
assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to
aid a sorely pressed knight in a fight, or those who support
the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town
when he or she is being hunted unjustly.
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations,
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your
identity as a knight of your order.
Your bond almost always involves the order to which
you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly
unusual for a knight's ideal not to reflect the agenda,
sentiment, or philosophy of one's order.
