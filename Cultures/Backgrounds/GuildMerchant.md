# Background: Guild Merchant

Before becoming an adventurer, you were a part of one of the more successful [Merchant Guilds](/Organizations/MerchantGuilds/MerchantGuilds.md). Your guild operated warehouses, organized caravans, managed stores, and owned ships, and has trade contacts throughout a sizable region of Azgaarnoth. Perhaps they import ore, uncut gems, untreated furs, or grain into [Mighal](/Cities/Mighal.md), or they export fine cloth, faceted gems, fine furs, or unique liquors or foods. Regardless, you've largely given that life up for some reason and have chosen to seek adventure instead. Nevertheless, the training you received then, and perhaps the contacts you made, serve you well as an adventurer.

## Feature: Factor
Although youâ€™ve left the day-to-day life of a merchant behind, your Guild has assigned you the services of a loyal retainer from the business: a factor, husbanding agent, seafarer, caravan guard, or clerk. This individual is a commoner who can perform mundane tasks for you such as making purchases, delivering messages, and running errands. He or she will not fight for you and will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if frequently endangered or abused. If he or she is killed, the Guild assigns you another within a few days. If the factor is treated well, they can often "run interference" with the Guild; treated poorly, they can often create obstacles for you even where there are none.

Through your factor, you have trade contacts such as caravan masters, shopkeepers, sailors, artisans, and farmers throughout the region. Once per game session, when adventuring in an area operated by your Guild, you can use those contacts to get information about the local area or to pass a message to someone in those areas.

Note that Merchant Guild obligations do not simply disappear--the Guild will often keep tabs on your activities through your factor, and messages will often come from the Guild informing you of activities or missions they would like you to partake. They may even at times levy a tax on your income from adventuring if you obtain a sizable sum! Guild ties are strings made of gold, but are often pulled most tight at the most inconvenient times.
