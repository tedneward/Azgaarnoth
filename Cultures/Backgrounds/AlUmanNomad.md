# Background: Al'Uman Nomad
You are of the innumerable tribes of Al'Uma, raised on a horse, mare's milk as your first food, wind in your hair, and grass beneath. Long hours were spent on the grass, mounted or on foot, with no other noise but the wind. Nights were often spent in either quiet communion with the rest of your tribe, or in festive celebration of one of the many, many festivals celebrated by the Al'Uma.

Despite your upraising (or because of it), you found a reason for leaving the relative comforts of the tribe to journey alone out in the world, bereft of family or tribe.
