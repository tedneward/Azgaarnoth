<p>Almost all of the common people and other folk that one might encounter along the Sword Coast or in the North have one thing in common: they live out their lives without ever traveling more than a few miles from where they were born.</p>
<p>You aren't one of those folk.</p>
<p>You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories. You have come to this part of Faerun for your own reasons, which you might or might not choose to share.</p>
<p>Although you will undoubtedly find some of this land's ways to be strange and discomfiting, you can also be sure that some things its people take for granted will be to you new wonders that you've never laid eyes on before. By the same token, you're a person of interest, for good or ill, to those around you almost anywhere you go. </p>
<p>Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception
Tool Proficiencies: Any one musical instrument or
gaming set of your choice, likely something native to
your homeland
Languages: Any one of your choice
Equipment: One set of traveler's clothes, any one
musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient
with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that
depict where you are in Faerun, a small piece of
jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland's
craftsmanship, and a pouch containing 5 gp
WHY ARE You HERE?
A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one
of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or
her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary.
To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the
table below or choose from the options provided. The
following section, discussing possible homelands, includes
some suggested reasons that are appropriate for
each location.
WHY ARE You HERE?
d6 Reason d6 Reason
Emissary 4 Pilgrim
2 Exile 5 Sightseer
3 Fugitive 6 Wanderer
WHERE ARE You FROM?
The most important decision in creating a far traveler
background is determining your homeland. The places
discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the
North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this
background.
Evermeet. The fabled elven is lands far to the west are
home to elves who have never been to Faerun. They often
find it a harsher place than they expected when they
do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical
(though not mandatory) choice for your homeland.
Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either
exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of
elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerun for a purpose
that benefits elven culture or society.
Halruaa. Located on the southern edges of the Shining
South, and hemmed in by mountains all around,
the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most
in Faerun who know about it. Many folk have heard
of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few
know of the tales that even the least of their people can
work magic.
Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerun
for personal reasons, since their government has a strict
stance against unauthorized involvement with other
nations and organizations. You might have been exiled
for breaking one of Halruaa's many byzantine laws,
or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the
gods of magic.
Kara-Tur. The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of
Faen1n, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar
to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur,
the people of Faerfin likely refer to you as Shou, even if
that isn't your true ethnicity, because that's the blanket
term they use for everyone who shares your origin.
The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faerfin as
diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous
merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of
some such delegation, then decided to stay when the
mission was over.
Mulhorand. From the terrain to the architecture to
the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything
about Mulhorand is a lien to someone from the
Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of
culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled
to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faerfin. Recent
events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery,
and a corresponding increase in the traffic between
Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faerfin.
Those who leave behind Mulhorand's sweltering deserts
and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different
life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North
simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer,
or because you have made too many enemies among the
desert communities of your home.
Sossal. Few have heard of your homeland, but many
have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from
Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and
white hair, and typically dressed in white.
Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against
the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other
sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the
Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort
to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing
reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek
something incredibly important.
Zakhara. As the saying goes among those in Faerfin
who know of the place, "To get to Zakhara, go south.
Then go south some more." Of course, you followed an
equally long route when you came north from your place
of birth. Though it isn't unusual for Zakharans to visit
the southern extremes of Faerfin for trading purposes,
few of them stray as far from home as you have.
You might be traveling to discover what wonders are
to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains
of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage
to understand the gods that others worship, so that
you might better appreciate your own deities.
The Underdark. Though your home is physically
closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed
here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one
of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its
own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one
of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are
probably a member of the race that occupies the placebut
you might also have grown up there after being captured
and brought below when you were a child.
If you are a true Underdark native, you might have
come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or
perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior
(whether warranted or not). If you aren't a native, your
reason for leaving "home" probably has something to do
with getting away from a bad situation.
FEATURE: ALL EYES ON You
Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps
even your appearance all mark you as foreign.
Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go,
which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly
interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands,
to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear
stories of your homeland.
You can parley this attention into access to people
and places you might not otherwise have, for you and
your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and
merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in
hearing about your distant homeland and people.
