<h1 id="background-faction-agent">Background: Faction Agent</h1>
<p>Many organizations active in the North and across the
face of Faerun aren't bound by strictures of geography.
These factions pursue their agendas without regard
for political boundaries, and their members operate
anywhere the organization deems necessary. These
groups employ listeners, rumormongers, smugglers,
sellswords, cache-holders (people who guard caches of
wealth or magic for use by the faction's operatives), haven
keepers, and message drop minders, to name a few.
At the core of every faction are those who don't merely
fulfill a sma ll function for that organization, but who
serve as its hands, head, and heart.
As a prelude to your adventuring career (and in preparation
for it), you served as an agent of a particular
faction in Faerun. You might have operated openly or
secretly, depending on the faction and its goals, as well
as how those goals mesh with your own. Becoming an
adventurer doesn't necessarily require you to relinquish
membership in your faction (though you can choose to
do so), and it might enhance your status in the faction.
Skill Proficiencies: Insight and one Intelligence,
Wisdom, or Charisma s kill of your choice, as
appropriate to your faction
Languages: Two of your choice
Equipment: Badge or emblem of your faction, a copy
of a seminal faction text (or a code-book for a covert
faction), a set of common clothes, and a pouch
containing 15 gp
FACTIONS OF THE SWORD COAST
The lack of large, centralized governments in the North
and along the Sword Coast is likely directly responsible
for the proliferation of secret societies and conspiracies
in those lands. If your background is as an agent for one
of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here
are some possibilities.
The Harpers. Founded more than a millennium ago,
disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers
remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which
acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge,
rather than brute force. Harper agents are often
proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept
at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other
Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers,
and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harpers'
ideals.
The Order of the Gauntlet. One of the newest power
groups in Faerun, the Order of the Gauntlet has an
agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are
vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are
holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote
jus tice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order
agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently
seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order's
ideals, and the clergy of the order's patron gods.
The Emerald Enclave. Maintaining balance in the
natural order and combating the forces that threaten
that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave.
Those who serve the faction are mas ters of survival and
living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature,
and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters,
rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who
revere the gods of nature.
The Lords' Alliance. On one level, the agents of the
Lords' Alliance are representatives of the cities and
other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a
faction with interests and concerns that transcend local
politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre
of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations,
wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable
in History, and can always rely on the aid of
the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other
leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance's ideals.
The Zhentarim. In recent years, the Zhentarim have
become more visible in the world at large, as the group
works to improve its reputation among the common
people. The faction draws employees and associates
from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve
the goals of the Black Network but a ren't necessarily
criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must
often work in secret, and a re frequently proficient in Deception.
They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries,
merchants and priesthoods allied with the Zhentarim.
FEATURE: SAFE HAVEN
As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network
of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance
on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs
and passwords you can use to identify such operatives,
who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house,
free room and board, or assistance in finding information.
These agents never risk their lives for you or risk
revealing their true identities.
SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Use the tables for the acolyte background in the Player's
Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations,
modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your
identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the
words "faith" and "faction" to be interchangeable.)
Your bond might be associated with other members of
your faction, or a location or an object that is important
to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in
keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction,
but might be more personal in nature.</p></div>
