# Background: Yithi Tribal Member
Yes, your history is that of the Hordes, but when Yithi unified the Twenty-Four, much of that history was left behind. No longer are you of the slobbering, mindless brutality that fought against the Eldar for centuries. Yithi showed the clans a better way, and you are firmly a part of that. No matter your physical birth, you are Yithi to the core.

Yithi's deep reverence for the land and nature guided him throughout his life, and that reverence has permeated through the nation he built. You spent much of your childhood seeking to be at peace with nature around you, even when nature was less than peaceful to you. Much of your childhood was spent learning simple medicinal remedies and survival skills.

Guided by a deep connection to all people and a connection to the land around you, you would've been happy to farm and herd and teach and learn, as most Yithi citizens do. But your calling was different, and so you journeyed out of your village or city, and took up that calling.

## FEATURE: UTHGARDT HERITAGE
You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe's territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the region from which you came. You are familiar enough with any ilderness area that you find twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forage there.

Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of your people, and those folk allied with your tribe, often including members of druid circles, tribes of nomadic elves, and Patheonic priesthoods.

## SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Use the tables for the outlander background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of an Ulmhorde tribe.

Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for now), you hold to the traditions of your people. You will never cut down a still-living tree, and you may not countenance such an act being done in your presence. The Ulmhorde's ancestral mounds--great hills where the totem spirits were defeated by Ulm and where the heroes of the tribes are interred--are sacred to you.

Your bond is undoubtedly associated with your tribe or some aspect of Ulmhorde philosophy or culture (perhaps even Ulm himself). Your ideal is a personal choice that probably hews closely to the ethos of your people and certainly doesn't contradict or compromise what being an Ulmhorde stands for.
