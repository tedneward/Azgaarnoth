# Background: United Hordes Tribal Member
Your ancient history may be one of bloodshed and violence, but that is all in the past--what the Hordes once stood for, they do so no longer. Yes, there are times when violence is necessary, but much more can be gained by finding ways to work together. The single reed can easily be snapped--but the bundle of reeds is impossible to break. Cooperation trumps competition.

The "old ways" are powerful, but only so long as they are not used to create chaos. Your people have always tried to find the path between darkness and light, between tradition and taboo, and diplomacy and enlightenment. This careful dance between old and new has kept the United Hordes strong while the Ulmhorde--your lost brethren--descends even further into chaos and ruin. Ulm, the so-called "Chosen One" (a self-imposed title if ever there was one), leads kindred into deeper and deeper oceans of blood in the name of tradition, and much has been lost.

You might have grown up in one of the tribes that had decided to embrace the old ways and journey to Ulm, and now that they have abandoned the true path, you find yourself adrift. You might be a member of a tribe that is fiercely opposed to the idiocy that is the "Chosen One", carrying the fight to the front lines of the ever-active war between the Ulmhorde and the United Hordes. Or perhaps you are truly seeking to embrace diplomacy, journeying to see the civlized world and its wonders, bringing back tales and lessons that can be shared with the tribes.

## FEATURE: URUK HERITAGE
You have an excellent knowledge of not only your tribe's territory, but also the terrain and natural resources of the rest of the Tragekia. You are familiar enough with any wilderness area that you find twice as much food and water as you normally would when you forage there.

Additionally, you can call upon the hospitality of your people, and those folk allied with your tribe, often including members of druid circles, tribes of nomadic elves, and Patheonic priesthoods.

## SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS
Use the tables for the outlander background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of an Tragekian tribe.

Even if you have left your tribe behind (at least for now), you hold to the some of the more "quaint" traditions of your people. You will never cut down a still-living tree, though you see it as more "bad luck" than a spiritual crime. The United Hordes' ancestral mounds--great hills where the totem spirits were tamed and where the heroes of the tribes are interred--are sacred to you, but only because of what they represent, not because you believe in their divinity.

Your bond is undoubtedly associated with your tribe and/or some aspect of United Hordes philosophy or culture. Your ideal is a personal choice that probably hews closely to the ethos of your people and certainly doesn't contradict or compromise what being a part of the United Hordes stands for.
