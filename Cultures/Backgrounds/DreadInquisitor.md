# Background: Dread Inquisitor

Historically, inquisitors were detectives who investigated crimes both mundane and supernatural. They were known for traveling to remote parishes plagued by unexplained murders, and for exposing Hordish living among normal humans. Over time, as the wars against the Hordes grew more and more desperate, a group of inquisitors calling themselves the Dread Inquisitors led a series of brutal forays into Hordish-held territory and the border regions thereabouts. They executed suspected Hordish spies with little or no proof, and punished accused heretics in unsanctioned trials.

In time, the Dread Emperor reasserted his authority over the inquisitors and restricted their power once again, but the fear of the inquisitor has never been lost, and many still speak of them by their "Dread" moniker.

## Suggested Characteristics
Inquisitors are often driven by zeal, plagued with suspicion, and haunted by self-doubt. They are all too susceptible to human failings, and their judgment is not always divinely inspired.
