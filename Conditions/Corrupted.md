# Conditions: Corrupted

Certain magical actions can bring the power of the Abyss to bear directly upon a creature; when this effect is not instantaneous, that creature is *corrupted* and suffers several effects.

* It emits a dim green glow in a 5-foot radius.
* It is poisoned.
* It can't benefit from being invisible.

A corrupted creature can use its action to make a Constitution saving throw. It has disadvantage to the save when it is inside Signs of Corruption. On a success, it is no longer corrupted.
