# The Undersea
Like the [Underdark](Underdark.md), the Undersea is the name given to those places of occupation that lie deep on the floor of the oceans and seas that surround the Azgaarnothian continents. Too many stories and reports and sightings--by credible witnesses and scholars--of [mer-folk, lizardfolk, and other sea-based races](/Races/Undersea.md) persist for the surface-dwellers to ignore the distinct likelihood of civilizations and nations beneath the waves, although the extent and degree of sophistication of these races is up for extreme debate.
