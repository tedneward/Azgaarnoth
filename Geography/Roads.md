# Great Roads of Azgaarnoth

## The Al'Uman Road
*(runs from [Zvelaino](/Cities/Zvelaino.md) to [Fenpreloval](/Cities/Fenpreloval.md) before turning southeast to [Heral](/Cities/Heral.md))*

Known as the Yithian Road once it crosses into [Yithi](/Nations/Yithi.md), the Al'Uman Road is the major thoroughfare runnign east-west through almost the entirety of the [Alalihatian Caliphate](/Nations/Alalihat.md) before crossing into the [Zalabasan Caliphate](/Nations/Zabalasa.md), meeting up with the Zalabasan Highway, and continuing from there into Yithi.

The Al'Uman Road is one of the engineering marvels of the Azgaarnothian world, made out of materials lost to time (and thought to be direct product of the Eldar's labor). It is a smooth, slightly-stubbled rock, grayish in color but resistant to nearly any force applied to it. The only other road that appears to be made out of the same material is that of the Kingsroad in [Liria](/Nations/Liria.md).

## The Dawn Way

## The Lirian Kingsroad
*(runs from [Flakew](/Cities/Flakew.md) to [Mighal](/Cities/Mighal.md) around the entirety of the [Sea of Liria](./SeaOfLiria.md))*

## The Yithian Road
*(runs from [Zvelaino](/Cities/Zvelaino.md) to [Fenpreloval](/Cities/Fenpreloval.md) before turning southeast to [Heral](/Cities/Heral.md))*

The Yithian Road is one of the engineering marvels of the Azgaarnothian world, made out of materials lost to time (and thought to be direct product of Eldar efforts). It is a smooth, slightly-stubbled rock, grayish in color but resistant to nearly any force applied to it. The only other road that appears to be made out of the same material is that of the Kingsroad in [Liria](/Nations/Liria.md).

## The Zhian Route
*(runs from [Fenpreloval](/Cities/Fenpreloval.md) to [Nacoal](/Cities/Nacoal.md))*

The Zhian Route is a source of pride to the Zhian scholars who produced it shortly after the founding of Zhi. Although not as permanent as the substance that makes up the Al'Uman/Yithian Road, it resists damage far better than most materials, and it is rumored that when necessary, certain Yithi and Zhian riders can ride the Route for days without tiring or hunger. It appears as a slightly-lighter color than the Al'Uman/Yithian road material, but some travelers have told stories of how it will sometimes appear to faintly glow a greenish color at night.
