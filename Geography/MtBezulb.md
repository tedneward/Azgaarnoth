# Mt Bezulb

The only active volcano in Azgaarnoth, it has been active for many centuries, constantly putting forth a steady stream of lava and periodically (every several decades or so) erupting more forcefully. Some scholars posit that this is something to do with the emergence of the [drow](../Races/Firstborn.md), others say that the constant eruption is encouraged by [dwarves](../Races/Firstborn.md) under the earth who require the volcanic activity in order to work with mithral and adamantine metals.
