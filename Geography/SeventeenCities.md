# Geography: The Seventeen Cities
These are a list of cities, originally built by the [dwarves](/Races/Dwarves.md) in the [Underdark](/Geography/Underdark.md) under the [Daw Mountains](/Geography/DawMountains.md), that fell to the [Hordes](/Races/Hordes.md). In time, as city after city fell, dwarven clans were forced to relocate further and further west in a general retreat that came to stand as a symbol of shame and regret; this was later called the Exodus. 

Little is known about the Seventeens' current state--or occupancy--but they factor prominently in dwarven poetry, literature, song, and history. Dwarvish music often alternates between the glories of the Seventeen, the tragedy of their fall, the evils of those who took them, and the triumphant Return that will someday return them to dwarvish hands.

Dwarves insist that, even six thousand years later, thanks to the strength and fortitude of dwarvish engineering, the Cities still stand, and each of the Returns has declared the liberation of all Seventeen as their aim.

Four of the Seventeen were occupied during the Fourth and Fifth Return, but bickering among the dwarven kings led to the dissolution of the Fourth Return, and the Fifth Return disastrously overextended itself, and the four were lost again. (Very few dwarves discuss the Fourth or Fifth Returns among non-dwarven audiences.)

The names of the Seventeen are known, but their locations are less clear; what is known (among the non-dwarven) is as follows:
